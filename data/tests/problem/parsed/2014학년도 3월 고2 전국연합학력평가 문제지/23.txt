Whenever I look into my daughter Emily’s face, I think 
about the power of fatherhood. Her face reminds me ① that 
I have given her more than just my name. Like me, she has 
freckles stretching across the bridge of her nose almost like 
a Band­Aid. The skin around her eyes ② form small and thin 
lines, and the lines match mine. “When Emily smiles,” my 
mother tells me, “she looks just like you.” Other things in 
her are reflections of me. I see myself most ③ clearly in 
her eyes, the windows to her soul. Like me, Emily has a 
drive ④ to succeed and will try anything. “Who needs to 
wait for instructions?” she used to tell ⑤ herself as she 
attempted to do the high bar in gymnastics class; more than 
once, she failed. Also, more than once, she succeeded.
* high bar: (체조의) 철봉
