I’ve been a career woman for the past seven years. For a 
couple of years after giving birth to my first daughter, it 
was really tough for me to work and take care of her at the 
same time. So I know how necessary the babysitting service 
you’re providing is. And I feel really grateful for the service 
too. There is, however, one thing I’d like you to consider. 
Currently, a babysitter is taking care of my second daughter 
for eight hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For me, it would be 
much more useful if the service were available from 8 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. Could you be more flexible with your service? I’d 
really appreciate it.
