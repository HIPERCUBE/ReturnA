29. The biggest trap many family gardeners fall into is 
creating a garden that is too large. Even though you may 
have the best of intentions, over time a garden that is too 
large will become a maintenance nightmare. My family, like 
many others, eagerly planted large gardens only to cut back 
slowly on the time devoted to gardening. Sometime in 
September, we ended up with a garden full of overripened 
fruit and out­of­control, overgrown plants. This situation is 
not enjoyable for adult gardeners, let alone for children. Most 
children (and many adults) won’t enjoy spending their warm 
sunny days tending an overgrown garden plot. When thinking 
about the size of your family garden, be               . Plan 
the size according to the time your family can devote to the 
garden.
