32. A miser tries to save his money. But he is failing to 
utilize what he owns. If he were to realize how he is 
limiting his true wealth, he would hasten to find some 
worthy person or institution that would benefit from a 
portion of his fortune. The part that he gives away might 
seem to diminish the size of his fortune. However, in reality 
what he gives away remains his eternal possession. And the 
true size of his fortune is calculated by what he gives and 
not by what he keeps. Some people use the expression, “He 
is worth ‘X’ amount of money.” They usually refer to a 
person’s money and property that has not yet been given 
away. The expression would be more accurate if the 
calculations included             . [3점]
