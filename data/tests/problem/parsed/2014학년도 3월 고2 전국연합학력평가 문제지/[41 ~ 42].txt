The violent reality of war has a damaging effect on 
every level of our humanity ─ our bodies, our minds, and 
our spirits. Once I had the opportunity to live in 
Bethlehem, on the West Bank, for three years. During 
that time, I often traveled back and forth from 
Bethlehem to Jerusalem. On one trip, when the border 
was closed to Palestinians, I happened to arrive at a 
checkpoint at the same time as a young Palestinian 
woman. She was carrying a newborn, her first child, 
trying to take it to the hospital in Jerusalem.
The young mother appeared to be around nineteen 
years old, about the same age as the soldier who met 
her at the checkpoint. Her attempts to convince him to 
allow her to cross the border went from talking to 
pleading to crying.
Seeing the woman’s growing desperation, the soldier 
was obviously moved. It was clear that she was sincere 
in her attempt to take her child to the hospital. As the 
conversation grew more intense, I noticed that both the 
young mother and the equally young soldier began to cry 
together. It was sad to watch, as the soldier could 
only her entry into Jerusalem even though it 
was completely against his wishes. I was struck by the 
pain and anguish that both of these young people 
endured because of the political situation.
