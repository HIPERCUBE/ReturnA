22. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
A 17­year­old patient sat in my counseling office some 
time ago and said, “I’m so tired of my father telling me that 
I don’t live up to my potential. ① He says it about once a 
month.” This young man is a typical product of a 
high­achieving father. His father is a physician who has a 
terrible time with both his employees and his children 
because ② he expects the same sort of drive in everyone 
else. ③ He is trying to inspire his son, but the result is 
defiance. Here is why. If the father says, “You have great 
potential,” it is a compliment to ④ his talent, but it is 
quickly spoiled with the remark, “You don’t live up to your 
potential.” In the process ⑤ he has attacked his son’s 
character.
* defiance: 반항, 저항
