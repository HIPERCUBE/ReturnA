33. Anyone who has ever achieved any degree of success 
knows that                                                . 
Success is borne on the shoulders of commitment, discipline, 
and persistence. Yet our popular culture conveys a very 
different message to children: success doesn’t have to be 
difficult or time consuming. Popular culture is full of stories 
about overnight successes, pills to lose weight fast, and 
“breakthrough” products to look ten years younger. Children 
see young actors such as Hilary Duff and Haley Joel Osment 
and musical geniuses like the violinist Sarah Chang, but they 
don’t see the many years of determination, practice, and 
sacrifice that got them to the top of their professions. 
Children don’t realize that overnight successes are usually 
ten years in the making. [3점]
