30. Compared to past generations, we are quite well off. In the 
past fifty years, the average buying power has more than 
tripled. We own a lot of electronic devices that are designed 
to make our lives easier, but still, as sociologists are eager 
to point out, there is no end to the list of things to do in 
our daily lives. We work as hard as our grandparents did, 
and the result is flawlessness but not freedom. The curtain 
edges are free of dirt, the picture hooks on the wall are 
firmly in place, and our eggs come out just the way we like 
them. The more we have, the more we want. The result is 
an apparent scarcity of time, a dilemma that seems to grow 
with each passing year, even though there is plenty of time 
to go around.                                     is the 
price we pay for an abundance of options. [3점]
