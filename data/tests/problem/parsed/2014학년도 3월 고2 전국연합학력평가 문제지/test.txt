I’ve been a career woman for the past seven years. For a 
couple of years after giving birth to my first daughter, it 
was really tough for me to work and take care of her at the 
same time. So I know how necessary the babysitting service 
you’re providing is. And I feel really grateful for the service 
too. There is, however, one thing I’d like you to consider. 
Currently, a babysitter is taking care of my second daughter 
for eight hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. For me, it would be 
much more useful if the service were available from 8 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. Could you be more flexible with your service? I’d 
really appreciate it.

19. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
People often don’t consider purchasing boats, renting a 
beach house, or taking care of pool maintenance during the 
winter, but that’s exactly when you should be looking for 
good deals on these things. Providers of those items or 
services are often less busy at those times. So you’ll get a 
warmer reception than you would during the busy season 
when there’s more demand. That doesn’t mean you have to 
plan your vacation at the beach in December. But you are 
more likely to have a fruitful negotiation if you begin the 
discussion in the off­season.

② 불필요한 상품 구매를 자제하는 것이 좋다.
③ 고객에 대한 서비스는 일관성이 있어야 한다.
④ 상품이나 서비스 구매는 비수기에 하는 것이 유리하다.
⑤ 많은 정보를 수집할수록 협상에서 우위를 점할 수 있다.
20. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Sports involve your brain as much as your body: you have 
to understand plays, see the field and know your next move, 
block out the crowd, and concentrate on your performance. 
You also need to control anxiety and negative thoughts. It 
takes practice to develop these mental skills, which is no 
different from the development of physical skills. Dr. Alan 
Goldberg, a sports psychologist, says that most performance 
problems that athletes struggle with are not a result of 
inadequate coaching or a lack of physical skills or technical 
ability. When the heat of competition is turned up, the 
individual performer or team that falls apart most often does 
so because of mental factors like poor concentration, 
negativity, lack of confidence, or an inability to let go of 
mistakes.
① the effects of physical training on team sports
② the characteristics of the best­performing athletes
③ the importance of controlling mental factors in sports
④ the necessity of encouraging each other during the game
⑤ how to build strong teamwork to win a sports competition
21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
If you’ve ever visited a fortune­teller you probably came 
away amazed at the things they knew about you ─ things no 
one else could possibly have known. So it must be a 
supernatural power, right? Research into the fortune­telling 
business shows that fortune­tellers use a technique known as 
“cold reading,” which can produce an accuracy of around 80 
percent when “reading” a person you’ve never met. While it 
can appear magical to some people, it is simply a process 
based on the careful observation of body­language signals 
plus an understanding of human nature and a knowledge of 
probability statistics. It’s a technique practiced by tarot­card 
readers, astrologers, and palm readers to gather information 
about a “client.”
* cold reading: 사전 지식 없이 빠르게 알아차리는 것
① Don’t Ignore Supernatural Things
② How Fortune­Tellers Know So Much
③ Why People Want Their Fortune Told
④ Nonverbal Signals Show Your Emotions
⑤ Your Future Depends on Your Willpower
22. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
A 17­year­old patient sat in my counseling office some 
time ago and said, “I’m so tired of my father telling me that 
I don’t live up to my potential. ① He says it about once a 
month.” This young man is a typical product of a 
high­achieving father. His father is a physician who has a 
terrible time with both his employees and his children 
because ② he expects the same sort of drive in everyone 
else. ③ He is trying to inspire his son, but the result is 
defiance. Here is why. If the father says, “You have great 
potential,” it is a compliment to ④ his talent, but it is 
quickly spoiled with the remark, “You don’t live up to your 
potential.” In the process ⑤ he has attacked his son’s 
character.
* defiance: 반항, 저항
23. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
Whenever I look into my daughter Emily’s face, I think 
about the power of fatherhood. Her face reminds me ① that 
I have given her more than just my name. Like me, she has 
freckles stretching across the bridge of her nose almost like 
a Band­Aid. The skin around her eyes ② form small and thin 
lines, and the lines match mine. “When Emily smiles,” my 
mother tells me, “she looks just like you.” Other things in 
her are reflections of me. I see myself most ③ clearly in 
her eyes, the windows to her soul. Like me, Emily has a 
drive ④ to succeed and will try anything. “Who needs to 
wait for instructions?” she used to tell ⑤ herself as she 
attempted to do the high bar in gymnastics class; more than 
once, she failed. Also, more than once, she succeeded.
* high bar: (체조의) 철봉
24. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 
적절한 것은?
It was once considered an amazing achievement to reach 
the summit of Mount Everest. It was even a national
(A) disgrace / honor  to have a climber waving a national flag 
there. But now that almost 4,000 people have reached its 
summit, the achievement means less than it did a half century 
ago. In 1963, six people reached the top, but in the spring of 
2012, the summit was crowded with more than 500 people. 
Then what makes it (B) difficult / possible  for so many 
people to reach the summit? One important factor is improved 
weather forecasting. In the past, (C) lack / presence  of 
information led expeditions to attempt the summit whenever 
their team members were ready. Today, with hyper­accurate 
satellite forecasts, all teams know exactly when the weather 
will be perfect for climbing, and they often go for the top on 
the same days.
(A)  (B)   (C)
① disgrace ……   difficult   …… presence
② disgrace ……   possible   …… lack
③ honor ……   difficult   …… lack
④ honor ……   possible   …… presence
⑤ honor ……   possible   …… lack
25. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 
않은 것은?
It is important to remember that a misunderstanding is 
never ended by an argument but by a ① sympathetic desire 
to see the other person’s view. As Buddha said, “Hatred is 
never ended by hatred but by love.” Here is an example: Pat 
Duffy was selling cars for General Motors. If a buyer made 
a ② positive remark about the car he was selling, Pat would 
get upset at the customer. He would talk back to the 
customer and ③ win lots of arguments, but he didn’t sell 
many cars. Finally, he learned to handle the customers and 
here is how. If a customer said, “This GM car is no good! I 
would rather buy a Ford car,” Pat, instead of arguing, said, 
“Ford cars are good, and it is a fine company.” This made 
the customer ④ speechless. There was no room for 
argument. Now instead of wasting time arguing about Ford 
cars, Pat got off that subject and ⑤ concentrated on the GM 
cars he was selling.

Schools with the Most Extra­Inning Games
at the College World Series Games
The graph above shows four schools with the most 
extra­inning games at the College World Series Games and their 
records of wins and losses. ①All the teams had more wins 
than losses in the extra­inning games at the College World 
Series Games. ②Three of the four schools had more than ten 
extra­inning games. ③Arizona State and Texas had exactly the 
same record with seven wins and five losses. ④ Of the four

27. Lydecker 형제에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The brothers Howard and Theodore Lydecker were 
responsible for the wonderful special effects in movie serials 
made by Republic Pictures from the 1930s to the 1950s. 
They specialized in creating extremely realistic effects on 
very low budgets. Among the qualities that made their 
effects so believable were carefully constructed models and 
an insistence that their effects be created “in camera.” This 
means that they were achieved during the original filming. 
Because the effects were shot simultaneously on the same 
film stock, the image quality was very high. The Lydeckers 
developed a technique for flying model aircraft that produced 
very realistic results. It gave them complete control over 
the movement of the aircraft and is still used today.
* film stock: (사용하지 않은) 영화 촬영용 필름
① Republic Pictures가 만든 연작 영화의 특수 효과를 담당했다.
② 적은 예산으로 매우 사실적인 효과를 만들어냈다.
③ 세심하게 제작된 모형들을 촬영에 사용했다.
④ 영화 촬영 후 특수 효과를 별도로 추가했다.
⑤ 모형 비행기를 사용하는 기법을 개발했다.

29. The biggest trap many family gardeners fall into is 
creating a garden that is too large. Even though you may 
have the best of intentions, over time a garden that is too 
large will become a maintenance nightmare. My family, like 
many others, eagerly planted large gardens only to cut back 
slowly on the time devoted to gardening. Sometime in 
September, we ended up with a garden full of overripened 
fruit and out­of­control, overgrown plants. This situation is 
not enjoyable for adult gardeners, let alone for children. Most 
children (and many adults) won’t enjoy spending their warm 
sunny days tending an overgrown garden plot. When thinking 
about the size of your family garden, be               . Plan 
the size according to the time your family can devote to the 
garden.
① diligent ② ambitious ③ realistic
④ challenging ⑤ cooperative
30. Compared to past generations, we are quite well off. In the 
past fifty years, the average buying power has more than 
tripled. We own a lot of electronic devices that are designed 
to make our lives easier, but still, as sociologists are eager 
to point out, there is no end to the list of things to do in 
our daily lives. We work as hard as our grandparents did, 
and the result is flawlessness but not freedom. The curtain 
edges are free of dirt, the picture hooks on the wall are 
firmly in place, and our eggs come out just the way we like 
them. The more we have, the more we want. The result is 
an apparent scarcity of time, a dilemma that seems to grow 
with each passing year, even though there is plenty of time 
to go around.                                     is the 
price we pay for an abundance of options. [3점]
① Feeling pressed for time
② Being exposed to danger
③ A widening generation gap
④ Boredom out of convenience
⑤ Economic imbalance among social groups
31. For the last 20 years, some educators have believed that 
children should not be allowed to experience failure. 
Educational situations were structured so that every child 
could be successful nearly all the time. It was reasoned that 
the experience of failure would discourage students from 
future study. In the field of science, however, finding out 
what does not work is as important as finding out what 
does. In fact, real advances in science tend to occur 
when                    . Although 
students should not be constantly faced with frustrating 
learning situations, a positive attitude toward failure may 
better serve them in developing problem­solving skills. After 
all, in much of scientific inquiry, there are no right or wrong 
answers. [3점]
① students are constantly motivated
② the chance of failure is minimized
③ various fields of studies are linked
④ solutions do not fit the predictions
⑤ a small achievement is not overlooked
32. A miser tries to save his money. But he is failing to 
utilize what he owns. If he were to realize how he is 
limiting his true wealth, he would hasten to find some 
worthy person or institution that would benefit from a 
portion of his fortune. The part that he gives away might 
seem to diminish the size of his fortune. However, in reality 
what he gives away remains his eternal possession. And the 
true size of his fortune is calculated by what he gives and 
not by what he keeps. Some people use the expression, “He 
is worth ‘X’ amount of money.” They usually refer to a 
person’s money and property that has not yet been given 
away. The expression would be more accurate if the 
calculations included             . [3점]
① the pleasure of saving money
② what one has donated to others
③ the current value of one’s property
④ the money coming from investments
⑤ what one has lost from hasty decisions
33. Anyone who has ever achieved any degree of success 
knows that                                                . 
Success is borne on the shoulders of commitment, discipline, 
and persistence. Yet our popular culture conveys a very 
different message to children: success doesn’t have to be 
difficult or time consuming. Popular culture is full of stories 
about overnight successes, pills to lose weight fast, and 
“breakthrough” products to look ten years younger. Children 
see young actors such as Hilary Duff and Haley Joel Osment 
and musical geniuses like the violinist Sarah Chang, but they 
don’t see the many years of determination, practice, and 
sacrifice that got them to the top of their professions. 
Children don’t realize that overnight successes are usually 
ten years in the making. [3점]
① one person can make a big difference
② nothing in life worth having comes easily
③ people have to accept their children as they are
④ there’s always another way to get something done
⑤ successful people are talented in many different fields

34. Suppose that you can choose only one item from a 
selection of desserts that includes pecan ice cream, 
doughnuts, chocolate chip cookies, and cheese cake. Select 
one of these at random ─ say, pecan ice cream. Then, out of 
all the other desserts, identify the one that you like best 
out of that group. In my case, it’d be chocolate chip cookies. 
My decision about which dessert to eat now is made by 
simply (A)  how I feel about pecan ice cream with 
how I feel about chocolate chip cookies. To select the ice 
cream means not being able to eat the chocolate chip 
cookies. I’ll do that only if the pleasure from eating the ice 
cream (B)  the loss of giving up the chocolate chip 
cookies. [3점]

35. You can do a number of things to keep the air in your 
home clean. Most of them don’t require much effort. 
Houseplants are by far the best way to filter indoor air.  
(A) , spider plants love to absorb carbon monoxide 
and dioxide, and they’re easy to grow. In fact, they’re so 
prolific that you’ll have a thousand little baby spider plants 
in no time, whether you like it or not. Not only can some 
types of plants reduce air pollutants, but they can also 
convert carbon dioxide back into oxygen. (B) , be 
aware that poorly maintained plants can provide excellent 
breeding grounds for harmful bugs. If you want plants, be 
prepared to take care of them.

36. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
I’m not sure which one of us did the talking, but it must 
have been pretty convincing because Mr. Montague agreed to 
audition us the very next day. We couldn’t believe it. We 
were shocked. Rehearsal was over for the day. After we 
stopped screaming and hugging and dancing around Jean’s 
basement, I ran all the way home to tell Mom about our 
“lucky break.” She was delighted, and she insisted on going 
with us to the audition, as much for support as to make 
sure everything was going smoothly. I felt like a little kid 
on Christmas Eve. I didn’t sleep even an hour that night. 
That was probably why the next day seemed like a dream.
① sad and depressed ② excited and happy
③ relieved and sympathetic ④ scared and frightened
⑤ ashamed and embarrassed

In general, there are two major styles of practice 
when it comes to medicine. In the past, the relationship 
between the doctors and patients was mostly 
paternalistic. In other words, doctors acted in a “father 
knows best” fashion.
(A) The doctor’s task in this case is not to tell what to do 
but to educate the patient about various treatment 
options. Ultimately, the doctor allows his patients to 
reach an informed decision about their own health 
conditions.
(B) The other style of medical practice can be described as 
informative. As the paternalistic style slowly goes out 
of favor with the general public, the informative style is 
gradually taking hold as the more common type of 
doctor­patient relationship.
(C) In this type of relationship, the doctor told what needed 
to be done, and the patient followed it without asking a 
lot of questions. This style of medicine allowed only for 
one­way communication.

But being good at chess isn’t a real measure of 
“intelligence.”
Do you think a computer is smarter than people? ( ① ) In 
the case of chess, it has been proven that a computer can 
store and handle more bits of information about chess moves 
than a human brain can. ( ② ) In fact, there are other 
board games that computers are pretty hopeless at. ( ③ ) 
For instance, in the complex board game Go, even the most 
advanced computers can’t beat beginners. ( ④ ) The same 
goes for complex card games like poker, which computers 
are not good at because they can’t bluff (or even cheat) the 
way human players do. ( ⑤ ) To play poker or Go well, 
you need other things like intuition and creativity.

When you take a step, cross your legs, or bend to tie 
your shoe, your knees are working hard. ① Your knees take 
a great deal of stress every day, and you need to take good 
care of them. ② To increase your knee strength, you should 
boost the surrounding muscles, which act as a support 
system. ③ You can strengthen these muscles by doing 
exercises such as knee extensions. ④ The next time you go 
out walking or jogging, remember how hard your heart and 
lungs are working for you. ⑤ Maintaining a healthy weight 
and wearing proper footwear while walking or jogging will 
also help you maintain healthy knee joints.

We often spend our childhood years testing our 
physical limits by doing all kinds of team sports. When 
we become high school students, we go so far as to 
engage in two or three team sports. That’s because we 
have enough physical strength. By the time we reach 
adulthood, however, very few of us can compete at the 
elite level, even though more than half of us still enjoy 
playing sports. That is, we’re finding we’re not as 
physically strong as we used to be. Naturally, we move 
away from team sports requiring collision, such as 
football, soccer, or basketball, and toward sports that 
offer less risk of physical injury or stress on the body. 
Actually, many people turn to sports for individuals. 
Thus, team sports become more difficult to organize in 
an adult world.

Adults tend to (A)  team sports, as their level

The violent reality of war has a damaging effect on 
every level of our humanity ─ our bodies, our minds, and 
our spirits. Once I had the opportunity to live in 
Bethlehem, on the West Bank, for three years. During 
that time, I often traveled back and forth from 
Bethlehem to Jerusalem. On one trip, when the border 
was closed to Palestinians, I happened to arrive at a 
checkpoint at the same time as a young Palestinian 
woman. She was carrying a newborn, her first child, 
trying to take it to the hospital in Jerusalem.
The young mother appeared to be around nineteen 
years old, about the same age as the soldier who met 
her at the checkpoint. Her attempts to convince him to 
allow her to cross the border went from talking to 
pleading to crying.
Seeing the woman’s growing desperation, the soldier 
was obviously moved. It was clear that she was sincere 
in her attempt to take her child to the hospital. As the 
conversation grew more intense, I noticed that both the 
young mother and the equally young soldier began to cry 
together. It was sad to watch, as the soldier could 
only her entry into Jerusalem even though it 
was completely against his wishes. I was struck by the 
pain and anguish that both of these young people 
endured because of the political situation.

(A)
R H Bing was a famous American mathematician. His 
full name, as recorded on his birth certificate, was R H 
Bing. (These were not initials, and there were no 
periods.) William Jaco was one of (a) his students at the 
University of Wisconsin in the 1960’s. In those days 
Bing had a great many students, and he once organized a 
trip to a mathematical event in Michigan.
(B)
Jaco was overwhelmed. He knew that the famous R H 
Bing was a great mathematician, but this was just too 
much. He told Bing how impressed he was. “Well,” said 
Bing, “I, too, heard the problem yesterday. And I, too, 
skipped dinner and the reception and stayed up all night 
thinking about it. (b) I just solved it half an hour ago.”
(C)
The only other person he found in the dining room 
was Bing himself, and Jaco sat down next to (c) him 
with an air of defeat. Bing asked him why he was up so 
early, and Jaco confessed that he had attacked this math 
question, which he related on the spot to Bing. Bing 
stared off into space for a while, scratched (d) his head, 
then grabbed up a napkin and wrote out a beautiful and 
elegant solution.
(D)
When they got there someone posed a math question 
that he had been saving up for the visiting 
mathematicians. Jaco was really interested in the 
question. He skipped the reception, skipped dinner, and 
stayed up all night thinking about the problem. He was 
determined to solve it and make Wisconsin proud. At 
6:00 a.m. the following morning he had not solved it, 
and (e) he went somewhat disappointedly off to 
breakfast.
