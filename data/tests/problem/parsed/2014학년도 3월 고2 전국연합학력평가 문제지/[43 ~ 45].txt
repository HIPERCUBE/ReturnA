(A)
R H Bing was a famous American mathematician. His 
full name, as recorded on his birth certificate, was R H 
Bing. (These were not initials, and there were no 
periods.) William Jaco was one of (a) his students at the 
University of Wisconsin in the 1960’s. In those days 
Bing had a great many students, and he once organized a 
trip to a mathematical event in Michigan.
(B)
Jaco was overwhelmed. He knew that the famous R H 
Bing was a great mathematician, but this was just too 
much. He told Bing how impressed he was. “Well,” said 
Bing, “I, too, heard the problem yesterday. And I, too, 
skipped dinner and the reception and stayed up all night 
thinking about it. (b) I just solved it half an hour ago.”
(C)
The only other person he found in the dining room 
was Bing himself, and Jaco sat down next to (c) him 
with an air of defeat. Bing asked him why he was up so 
early, and Jaco confessed that he had attacked this math 
question, which he related on the spot to Bing. Bing 
stared off into space for a while, scratched (d) his head, 
then grabbed up a napkin and wrote out a beautiful and 
elegant solution.
(D)
When they got there someone posed a math question 
that he had been saving up for the visiting 
mathematicians. Jaco was really interested in the 
question. He skipped the reception, skipped dinner, and 
stayed up all night thinking about the problem. He was 
determined to solve it and make Wisconsin proud. At 
6:00 a.m. the following morning he had not solved it, 
and (e) he went somewhat disappointedly off to 
breakfast.
