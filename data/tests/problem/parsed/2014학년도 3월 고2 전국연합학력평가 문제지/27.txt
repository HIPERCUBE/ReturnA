27. Lydecker 형제에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The brothers Howard and Theodore Lydecker were 
responsible for the wonderful special effects in movie serials 
made by Republic Pictures from the 1930s to the 1950s. 
They specialized in creating extremely realistic effects on 
very low budgets. Among the qualities that made their 
effects so believable were carefully constructed models and 
an insistence that their effects be created “in camera.” This 
means that they were achieved during the original filming. 
Because the effects were shot simultaneously on the same 
film stock, the image quality was very high. The Lydeckers 
developed a technique for flying model aircraft that produced 
very realistic results. It gave them complete control over 
the movement of the aircraft and is still used today.
