31. For the last 20 years, some educators have believed that 
children should not be allowed to experience failure. 
Educational situations were structured so that every child 
could be successful nearly all the time. It was reasoned that 
the experience of failure would discourage students from 
future study. In the field of science, however, finding out 
what does not work is as important as finding out what 
does. In fact, real advances in science tend to occur 
when                    . Although 
students should not be constantly faced with frustrating 
learning situations, a positive attitude toward failure may 
better serve them in developing problem­solving skills. After 
all, in much of scientific inquiry, there are no right or wrong 
answers. [3점]
① students are constantly motivated
② the chance of failure is minimized
③ various fields of studies are linked
④ solutions do not fit the predictions
⑤ a small achievement is not overlooked
