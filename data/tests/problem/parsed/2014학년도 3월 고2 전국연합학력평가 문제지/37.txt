In general, there are two major styles of practice 
when it comes to medicine. In the past, the relationship 
between the doctors and patients was mostly 
paternalistic. In other words, doctors acted in a “father 
knows best” fashion.
(A) The doctor’s task in this case is not to tell what to do 
but to educate the patient about various treatment 
options. Ultimately, the doctor allows his patients to 
reach an informed decision about their own health 
conditions.
(B) The other style of medical practice can be described as 
informative. As the paternalistic style slowly goes out 
of favor with the general public, the informative style is 
gradually taking hold as the more common type of 
doctor­patient relationship.
(C) In this type of relationship, the doctor told what needed 
to be done, and the patient followed it without asking a 
lot of questions. This style of medicine allowed only for 
one­way communication.
