Sports involve your brain as much as your body: you have 
to understand plays, see the field and know your next move, 
block out the crowd, and concentrate on your performance. 
You also need to control anxiety and negative thoughts. It 
takes practice to develop these mental skills, which is no 
different from the development of physical skills. Dr. Alan 
Goldberg, a sports psychologist, says that most performance 
problems that athletes struggle with are not a result of 
inadequate coaching or a lack of physical skills or technical 
ability. When the heat of competition is turned up, the 
individual performer or team that falls apart most often does 
so because of mental factors like poor concentration, 
negativity, lack of confidence, or an inability to let go of 
mistakes.
