It is important to remember that a misunderstanding is 
never ended by an argument but by a ① sympathetic desire 
to see the other person’s view. As Buddha said, “Hatred is 
never ended by hatred but by love.” Here is an example: Pat 
Duffy was selling cars for General Motors. If a buyer made 
a ② positive remark about the car he was selling, Pat would 
get upset at the customer. He would talk back to the 
customer and ③ win lots of arguments, but he didn’t sell 
many cars. Finally, he learned to handle the customers and 
here is how. If a customer said, “This GM car is no good! I 
would rather buy a Ford car,” Pat, instead of arguing, said, 
“Ford cars are good, and it is a fine company.” This made 
the customer ④ speechless. There was no room for 
argument. Now instead of wasting time arguing about Ford 
cars, Pat got off that subject and ⑤ concentrated on the GM 
cars he was selling.
