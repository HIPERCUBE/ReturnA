It was once considered an amazing achievement to reach 
the summit of Mount Everest. It was even a national
(A) disgrace / honor  to have a climber waving a national flag 
there. But now that almost 4,000 people have reached its 
summit, the achievement means less than it did a half century 
ago. In 1963, six people reached the top, but in the spring of 
2012, the summit was crowded with more than 500 people.

people to reach the summit? One important factor is improved 
weather forecasting. In the past, (C) lack / presence  of 
information led expeditions to attempt the summit whenever 
their team members were ready. Today, with hyper­accurate 
satellite forecasts, all teams know exactly when the weather 
will be perfect for climbing, and they often go for the top on 
the same days.
