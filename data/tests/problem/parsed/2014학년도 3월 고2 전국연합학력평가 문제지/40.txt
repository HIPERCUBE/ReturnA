We often spend our childhood years testing our 
physical limits by doing all kinds of team sports. When 
we become high school students, we go so far as to 
engage in two or three team sports. That’s because we 
have enough physical strength. By the time we reach 
adulthood, however, very few of us can compete at the 
elite level, even though more than half of us still enjoy 
playing sports. That is, we’re finding we’re not as 
physically strong as we used to be. Naturally, we move 
away from team sports requiring collision, such as 
football, soccer, or basketball, and toward sports that 
offer less risk of physical injury or stress on the body. 
Actually, many people turn to sports for individuals. 
Thus, team sports become more difficult to organize in 
an adult world.
