If you’ve ever visited a fortune­teller you probably came 
away amazed at the things they knew about you ─ things no 
one else could possibly have known. So it must be a 
supernatural power, right? Research into the fortune­telling 
business shows that fortune­tellers use a technique known as 
“cold reading,” which can produce an accuracy of around 80 
percent when “reading” a person you’ve never met. While it 
can appear magical to some people, it is simply a process 
based on the careful observation of body­language signals 
plus an understanding of human nature and a knowledge of 
probability statistics. It’s a technique practiced by tarot­card 
readers, astrologers, and palm readers to gather information 
about a “client.”
