But being good at chess isn’t a real measure of 
“intelligence.”
Do you think a computer is smarter than people? ( ① ) In 
the case of chess, it has been proven that a computer can 
store and handle more bits of information about chess moves 
than a human brain can. ( ② ) In fact, there are other 
board games that computers are pretty hopeless at. ( ③ ) 
For instance, in the complex board game Go, even the most 
advanced computers can’t beat beginners. ( ④ ) The same 
goes for complex card games like poker, which computers 
are not good at because they can’t bluff (or even cheat) the 
way human players do. ( ⑤ ) To play poker or Go well, 
you need other things like intuition and creativity.
