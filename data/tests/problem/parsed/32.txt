32.  Someone who really loves us will be honest with us but will 
also tend to see us through rose-colored glasses. Sandra 
Murray and her co-workers studied dating and married 
couples. They found that the happiest were those who idealized 
each other, who even saw their partners more positively than 
their partners saw themselves. When we’re in love, we’re 
biased to find those we love not only physically attractive but 
socially attractive as well. Moreover, the most satisfied 
married couples tend to approach problems without 
immediately criticizing their partners. Honesty has its place in 
a good relationship, but so does the                   of the other’s 
basic goodness. [3점]
