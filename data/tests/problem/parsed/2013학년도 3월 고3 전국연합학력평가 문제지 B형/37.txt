When scientists created a hunk of mass called the 
international prototype kilogram(IPK), and distributed about 
40 of these prototype kilograms to other countries, they 
realized contaminants could coat the kilogram’s surface. To 
try to counteract this effect, they made the masses into 
cylinders, which have less surface area to acquire dust and 
debris.     (A)    , the fundamental unit of mass has gained 
tens of micrograms of mass from surface contamination. A 
skilled technician will rub the cylinders with alcohol, but 
because every country cleans their kilograms differently and 
at different times, each kilogram in the world is off by a 
different, unknown amount.     (B)    , each country that 
has one of these standard masses has a slightly different 
definition of the kilogram, which could throw off science 
experiments that require very precise weight measurements 
or international trade in items that are highly restricted by 
weight.                            * IPK: 국제 킬로그램 표준기
