The MacDowell Colony is an artists’ colony, located in 
Peterborough, New Hampshire, USA. The colony is designed 
to facilitate a balance between social interaction and focus 
on work. Private studios are available to artists 24 hours a 
day, along with the dining and recreation rooms at Colony 
Hall. To ensure all colonists’ autonomy and privacy, no one 
may visit a studio without invitation. Breakfast and dinner 
are served in the dining room; lunch is delivered to each 
studio. After dinner, occasional presentations are a traditional, 
elective part of the stimulating and supportive environment. 
Friendships established among artists in residence often lead 
to collaborations and connections beyond the colony. The 
maximum length of residence is two months; the average 
stay is five to six weeks.
