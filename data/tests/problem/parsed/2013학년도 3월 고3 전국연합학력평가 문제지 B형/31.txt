31. When we are children, our bodies grow automatically. A 
year goes by, and we become taller, stronger, more capable 
of doing new things and facing new challenges. I think many 
people carry into adulthood a subconscious belief that 
mental, spiritual, and emotional growth follows a similar 
pattern. Time goes by, and we simply get better. We’re like 
Charlie Brown in Charles Schulz’s Peanuts comic strip, who 
once said, “I think I’ve discovered the secret of life― you 
just hang around until you get used to it.” The problem is 
that we don’t improve by simply living. We have to be  
about it. Musician Bruce Springsteen commented, 
“A time comes when you need to stop waiting for the man 
you want to become and start being the man you want to 
be.” No one improves by accident. Personal growth doesn’t 
just happen on its own.
