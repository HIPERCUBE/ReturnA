When we furnish our rooms or fill our closets, we say “I 
want that,” but we also tell manufacturers “make more of 
that” ― setting in motion a whole process of extraction, 
production, distribution, marketing, and sales. In the process, 
we tell each other that this level of consumption is normal, 
natural, and good. Each of our decisions, therefore, is a case 
study in ethics, a determination about the nature of “the 
good life.” As we peruse the stuff available to us, we’re 
making judgements about which goods are good for us and 
why. We don’t think we’re engaged in ethical reflection, but 
we are deciding what we value, and how we will embody 
our values in the material world. Our rooms and our 
belongings send messages about identity and community, but 
they also express our ethical sensibilities, whether we like it 
or not.
① Where we live decides what we consume.
② What we buy reflects what we value in life.
③ Old things carry the memories of their owners.
④ Ethics rarely has an impact on consumer behavior.
⑤ Excessive spending goes against our ethical values.
