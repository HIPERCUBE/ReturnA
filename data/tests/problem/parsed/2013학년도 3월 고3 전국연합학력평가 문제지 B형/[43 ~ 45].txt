(A)
Recently, Sylvia Sebring had a series of dreams in 
which she saw a light gray mare standing in a corral. 
The horse had a severe limp, and, what was most 
unsettling, the mare was telepathically asking her for 
help. Witnessing the plight of an injured horse was 
certainly not an unusual experience for Sylvia Sebring. 
(a) She is a vet and deals daily with suffering animals. 
But to dream repeatedly of an injured horse that was 
unknown to her was a unique occurrence for her. What 
did the horse want her to do?          * corral: 가축우리
(B)
When Sylvia Sebring visited the corral at the Marana 
Stockyards and saw the Arabian mare, (b) she knew 
immediately that the horse was the same light gray mare 
that she had seen in her dreams. Ms. Sebring knew that 
she had received the horse’s cry for help, and she was 
there to answer that desperate entreaty. At last, the 
outcry from an abandoned and injured horse had been 
answered. (c) She was now the proud owner of the 
Arabian mare and called her Dream Walker.
* entreaty: 간청
(C)
Ms. Sebring felt an eerie shock of recognition as she 
read about the mare found in the desert. The horse in 
the desert seemed to perfectly fit the horse in her 
dreams. Could it be that the horse had been sending her 
desperate messages in her dreams that (d) she needed 
to come and rescue it? Prompted to do some 
investigation regarding the condition and present location 
of the rescued horse, Ms. Sebring learned that the 
animal was due to be auctioned at the Marana 
Stockyards soon.
(D)
One day a local newspaper carried a story about a 
rescued horse that had been abandoned to die by drug 
smugglers in the desert. A US Customs Service aircraft 
had sighted the mare lying nearly dead. The horse had 
lain in the terrible heat of the desert with no water for 
at least a week. The newspaper story described the 
horse as a white Arabian mare, and stated that (e) she 
had a twelve­inch cut on one of her legs.
