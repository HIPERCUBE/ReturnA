34. Aristotle learned a lesson in wisdom in fourth­century B.C. 
Athens, watching the carpenters, shoemakers, blacksmiths, 
and boat pilots. Their work was not governed by 
systematically applying rules or following rigid procedures. 
The materials they worked with were too irregular, and each 
task posed new problems. Aristotle thought the choices 
craftsmen made in acting on the material world provided 
clues to the kind of know­how citizens needed to make 
moral choices in the social world. Aristotle was particularly 
fascinated with how the masons on the Isle of Lesbos used 
rulers. A normal, straight­edged ruler was of little use to 
the masons who were carving round columns from slabs of 
stone and needed to measure the circumference of the 
columns. Unless you bent the ruler. Which is exactly what 
the masons did. They fashioned a flexible ruler out of lead, 
a forerunner of today’s tape measure. For Aristotle, knowing  
was exactly what practical wisdom was all 
about. [3점]
