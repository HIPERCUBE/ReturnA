36. For a hunter­gatherer ancestor, it would have been useful 
to make plans and be able to follow through with them. It 
might be very advantageous to carefully and deliberately 
develop skills in tool­making, a development whose pay­off 
might be years away, rather than just try to use whatever 
can be grabbed when a tool is needed. However, much of 
hunter­gatherer life is unplannable because of events. It 
would really not be a good response, observing a passing 
herd of wildebeest, to say, “Actually, Wednesday is my 
honey­gathering day.” Life for a hunter­gatherer would be a 
series of urgent improvisations on the stimuli occurring right 
now, be they passing prey, the lack of passing prey, attacks 
by others, changes in the make­up of the group, or countless 
other possibilities. People would do well who could  
and quickly mobilize an energetic, 
spontaneous, physical response to whatever happened to turn 
up. [3점]
