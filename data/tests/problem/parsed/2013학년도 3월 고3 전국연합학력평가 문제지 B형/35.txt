35. In one experiment researchers had people sit at computers 
and review two online articles describing opposing theories 
of learning. One article laid out an argument that “knowledge 
is objective”; the other made the case that “knowledge is 
relative.” Each article was set up in the same way, with 
similar headings, and each had links to the other article, 
allowing a reader to jump quickly between the two to 
compare the theories. The researchers hypothesized that 
people who used the links would gain a richer understanding 
of the two theories and their differences than would people 
who read the pages sequentially, completing one before 
going on to the other. They were wrong. The test subjects 
who read the pages linearly actually scored considerably 
higher on a subsequent comprehension test than those who 
clicked back and forth between the pages.                  , 
the researchers concluded.
① The links helped to organize information
② Using the links got in the way of learning
③ Attitude is more important than knowledge
④ The more links, the higher level of popularity
⑤ The Web motivates people to read more articles
