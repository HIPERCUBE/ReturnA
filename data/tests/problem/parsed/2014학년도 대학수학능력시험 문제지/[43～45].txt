(A)
How much space do you need to be happy? Part of the 
American story is that bigger is better, and with cheap credit 
and tax breaks for home buyers, it’s tempting to stretch one’s 
finances to build or buy a larger house. My grandpa Otto 
chose a different path. (a) He didn’t want to find himself 
working longer and longer hours just to pay for more space 
and the stuff to fill it. He grew up in a farming community 
and within a very large family, so living simply was integral 
to his life philosophy.
(B)
Yet my grandpa loved his little home and was content with 
what he had. Even though the house was small, it didn’t feel 
cramped. As my dad said, “Everyone was happy and content. 
The size of the house didn’t matter.” My grandpa taught me 
that living a simple life isn’t about self-deprivation. Instead, 
it’s about giving yourself the time, freedom, and money to 
pursue your dreams. In many ways, I’ve modeled my life after 
that of my grandpa. I learned from (b) him that simplicity 
isn’t about austerity. It’s a revolution in personal growth. 
(C)
In the 1950s, when my dad was a little boy, my grandpa 
built a 600-square-foot cottage. (c) He put the twenty-by-
thirty-foot structure on a small plot of land in Pleasant Hill. 
Dad remarked, “Reusing and recycling was a necessity. In 
essence, (d) he was recycling before it became ‘cool.’” 
Grandpa got most of the materials for his little house from 
the Oakland docks, where he was working. It took four years 
to build the small cottage, and when they moved in, the roof 
wasn’t even on!
(D)
My dad recalled looking up at the stars in the roofless 
house as a twelve-year-old kid before falling asleep. Dad 
didn’t mind living in an unfinished house. (e) He described 
Pleasant Hill as “open and private. It felt like all the homes 
were on ten acres.” Over the years, my dad and grandpa 
noticed dramatic changes in their community. Each year 
more farmland was devoured to build strip malls and 
neighborhoods with larger homes. As real estate prices rose, 
many of their neighbors sold their homes and lots. Soon my 
grandpa had the only small house on the block, surrounded 
by a sea of homes four times the size of his dwelling.
