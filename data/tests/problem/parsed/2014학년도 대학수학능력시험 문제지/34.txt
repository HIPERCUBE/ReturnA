34. Like many errors and biases that seem irrational on the 
surface, auditory looming turns out, on closer examination, to 
be pretty smart. Animals like rhesus monkeys have evolved 
the same bias. This intentional error functions as an advance 
warning system, manned by the self-protection subself, 
providing individuals with a margin of safety when they are 
confronted with potentially dangerous approaching objects. 
If you spot a rhinoceros or hear an avalanche speeding 
toward you, auditory looming will motivate you to jump 
out of the way now rather than wait until the last second. 
The evolutionary benefits of immediately getting out of the 
way of approaching dangers were so strong that natural 
selection endowed us ― and other mammals ― with brains 
that . Although 
this kind of bias might inhibit economically rational 
judgment in laboratory tasks, it leads us to behave in a 
deeply rational manner in the real world. Being accurate is not 
always smart. [3점]

④ prompt us to overlook dangers without thinking rationally
⑤ accurately detect, but irrationally ignore, approaching dangers
