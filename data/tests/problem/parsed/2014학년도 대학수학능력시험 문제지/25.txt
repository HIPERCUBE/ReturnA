The names of pitches are associated with particular 
frequency values. Our current system is called A440 because 
the note we call ‘A’ that is in the middle of the piano keyboard 
has been fixed to have a frequency of 440 Hz. This is entirely 
arbitrary. We could fix ‘A’ at any frequency, such as 439 or 
424; different standards were used in the time of Mozart than 
today. Some people claim that the precise frequencies affect 
the overall sound of a musical piece and the sound of 
instruments. Led Zeppelin, a band popular in the 70s, often 
tuned their instruments away from the modern A440 standard 
to give their music an uncommon sound, and perhaps to link it 
with the European children’s folk songs that inspired many of 
their compositions. Many purists insist on hearing baroque 
music on period instruments, both because the instruments 
have a different sound and because they are designed to play 
the music in its original tuning standard, something that 
purists deem important.
