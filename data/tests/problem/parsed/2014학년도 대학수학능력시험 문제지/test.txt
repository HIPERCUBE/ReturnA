23. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
In our efforts to be the good child, the uncomplaining 
employee, or the cooperative patient, many of us fall into the 
trap of trying to please people by going along with whatever 
they want us to do. At times, we lose track of our own 
boundaries and needs, and the cost of this could be our life, 
both symbolically and literally. When we are unable to set 
healthy limits, it causes distress in our relationships. But when 
we learn to say no to what we don’t feel like doing in order to 
say yes to our true self, we feel empowered, and our 
relationships with others improve. So don’t be afraid to say 
no. Try to catch yourself in the moment and use your true 
voice to say what you really want to say.
① 난관을 극복할 때 성취감이 생긴다.
② 항상 타인의 입장을 먼저 고려해야 한다.
③ 자신이 원하지 않는 일은 거절할 필요가 있다.
④ 자신의 의견을 고집하면 대인 관계가 악화된다.
⑤ 제안을 승낙하기 전에는 그 의도를 파악해야 한다.
24. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
In order to successfully release himself from the control of 
his parents, a child must be secure in his parents’ power, as 
represented by their loving authority. The more effectively they 
communicate that authority, the more secure the child feels, and 
the better able he is to move away from them toward a life of his 
own. During this lengthy process, whenever he feels threatened, 
he turns back toward the safety of his parents’ love and 
authority. In other words, it is impossible for a child to 
successfully release himself unless he knows exactly where his 
parents stand, both literally and figuratively. That requires, of 
course, that his parents know where they themselves stand. If 
they don’t know where they stand ― if, in other words, they are 
insecure in their authority ― they cannot communicate security 
to their child, and he cannot move successfully away from 
them. Under the circumstances, he will become clingy, or 
disobedient, or both.
① importance of communicating parental authority to children 
for their independence
② requirements for preventing children from being disobedient 
to their parents
③ consequences of offering parental supervision for children’s 
independence
④ roles of parental authority in children’s social skills 
development
⑤ necessity of parental intervention in ensuring children’s 
safety
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
The names of pitches are associated with particular 
frequency values. Our current system is called A440 because 
the note we call ‘A’ that is in the middle of the piano keyboard 
has been fixed to have a frequency of 440 Hz. This is entirely 
arbitrary. We could fix ‘A’ at any frequency, such as 439 or 
424; different standards were used in the time of Mozart than 
today. Some people claim that the precise frequencies affect 
the overall sound of a musical piece and the sound of 
instruments. Led Zeppelin, a band popular in the 70s, often 
tuned their instruments away from the modern A440 standard 
to give their music an uncommon sound, and perhaps to link it 
with the European children’s folk songs that inspired many of 
their compositions. Many purists insist on hearing baroque 
music on period instruments, both because the instruments 
have a different sound and because they are designed to play 
the music in its original tuning standard, something that 
purists deem important.
① Unstable Pitches: A Common Thread in Music
② How Do Musicians Detect Pitch Differences?
③ How to Correctly Measure Frequency Values
④ Arbitrary Tuning: A New Trend in Music
⑤ Should ‘A’ Always Be Tuned at 440 Hz?
26. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
A friend of mine was sitting in the Miami airport reading a 
magazine while she waited to catch a plane to New York. Her 
attention was distracted by a rough, noisy quarrel taking place 
at the ticket counter. “But I must get to New York today!” 
① an angry lady hotly told the clerk. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but 
there are no more seats available,” came the reply. “But my 
eight-year-old daughter is on that plane. ② I can’t let her fly 
into New York City all by herself,” she cried. “Sorry, lady. The 
flight is full,” came the same answer. My friend had been 
watching and listening to the woman’s woeful story, and her 
heart was touched with compassion for ③ the distressed mother. 
She walked over to the ticket agent and offered to take a later 
flight, if it meant the woman could use ④ her ticket to travel to 
New York with her daughter. The agent welcomed my friend’s 
solution and quickly issued a revalidated ticket to ⑤ the woman, 
and then arranged for another flight for my friend.

Oxygen is what it is all about. Ironically, the stuff that gives 
us life eventually kills it. The ultimate life force lies in tiny 
cellular factories of energy, called mitochondria, ① that burn 
nearly all the oxygen we breathe in. But breathing has a price. 
The combustion of oxygen that keeps us alive and active 
② sending out by-products called oxygen free radicals. They 
have Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde characteristics. On the one 
hand, they help guarantee our survival. For example, when the 
body mobilizes ③ to fight off infectious agents, it generates a 
burst of free radicals to destroy the invaders very efficiently. 
On the other hand, free radicals move ④ uncontrollably 
through the body, attacking cells, rusting their proteins, 
piercing their membranes and corrupting their genetic code 
until the cells become dysfunctional and sometimes give up 
and die. These fierce radicals, ⑤ built into life as both 
protectors and avengers, are potent agents of aging.

28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 
않은 것은? [3점]
When people started to plant stored seed stock deliberately, 
they also began protecting their plants. This changed the 
evolutionary ① pressure that these food plants experienced, as 
they no longer had to survive in a natural environment. 
Instead, people created a new environment for them, and 
selected for other characteristics than nature previously had. 
Seeds recovered at archaeological sites clearly show that 
farmers selected for larger seeds and ② thinner seed coats. 
Thick seed coats are often ③ essential for seeds to survive in 
a natural environment because the seeds of many wild plants 
remain dormant for months until winter is over and rain sets 
in. But under human management thick seed coats are 
unnecessary, as farmers ④ evade responsibility for storing 
seeds away from moisture and predators. In fact, seeds with 
thinner coats were ⑤ preferred as they are easier to eat or 
process into flour, and they allow seedlings to sprout more 
quickly when sown.

The graph above shows the Canadian volunteer rates and 
average annual hours of seven age groups in 2007. ① In these 
groups, the volunteer rates ranged from 29% to 58%, and the 
Canadian average rate was 46%. ② The average annual hours 
increased with age except for the group aged between 25 and 
34, which volunteered an average of 133 hours. ③ The 15-24 
age group showed the highest volunteer rate but the second 
fewest average annual hours. ④ The 35-44 age group had 
fewer average annual hours than the 45-54 age group, while 
the 55-64 and 65-74 age groups showed the same average 
annual hours. ⑤ Despite their lowest rate of volunteering, 
seniors aged 75 and older gave more hours on average than 
any other age group.
30. Fourier에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier was a French mathematician 
and physicist. When he was eight years old, his father died, and 
less than a year after this tragedy, his mother passed away, 
leaving him an orphan. A charitable lady helped him attend a 
local military school. He wanted to become an officer but was 
not allowed to because he was the son of a tailor. In 1795, he 
became a teacher at the École Normale in Paris. During the 
post-Revolution frenzy, he spoke out against the use of the 
guillotine, for which he almost lost his life. When Napoleon 
invaded Egypt in 1798, Fourier and other scholars accompanied 
the expedition. Having returned to France, Fourier began his 
research on heat conduction. His mathematical theory of heat 
conduction earned him lasting fame. During his stay in Egypt he 
contracted a strange illness that confined him to well-heated 
rooms for the rest of his life. On May 16, 1830, Fourier died in
Paris.
* guillotine: 단두대
① 프랑스의 수학자이자 물리학자였다.
② 재단사의 아들이라는 이유로 장교가 되지 못했다.
③ 단두대 사용에 반대하다가 목숨을 잃을 뻔했다.
④ 열전도에 관한 수학 이론으로 명성을 얻었다.
⑤ 이집트에서 프랑스로 돌아온 후 이상한 병에 걸렸다.


35. Mathematics will attract those it can attract, but it will do 
nothing to overcome resistance to science. Science is universal 
in principle but in practice it speaks to very few. Mathematics 
may be considered a communication skill of the highest type, 
frictionless so to speak; and at the opposite pole from 
mathematics, the fruits of science show the practical benefits of 
science without the use of words. But those fruits are 
ambivalent. Science as science does not speak; ideally, 
all scientific concepts are mathematized when scientists 
communicate with one another, and when science displays its 
products to non-scientists it need not, and indeed is not able to, 
resort to salesmanship. When science speaks to others, it is no 
longer science, and the scientist becomes or has to hire a 
publicist who dilutes the exactness of mathematics. In doing 
so, the scientist reverses his drive toward mathematical 
exactness in favor of rhetorical vagueness and metaphor, thus 
. [3점]
① degrading his ability to use the scientific language needed 
for good salesmanship
② surmounting the barrier to science by associating science 
with mathematics
③ inevitably making others who are unskillful in mathematics 
hostile to science
④ neglecting his duty of bridging the gap between science 
and the public
⑤ violating the code of intellectual conduct that defines him 
as a scientist

36. F. Scott Fitzgerald thought that the test of first-rate 
intelligence was the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind 
at the same time and still function. The eons shaped our brains 
in the (A)  direction. Confirmation bias is a term for the 
way the mind systematically avoids confronting contradiction. 
It does this by overvaluing evidence that confirms what we 
already think or feel and undervaluing or simply disregarding 
evidence that refutes it. Testimony from members of the Crow 
tribe about the destruction of their culture provides an extreme 
and tragic example of this. A man named Plenty Coups 
reported that “when the buffalo went away, the hearts of my 
people fell to the ground and they could not lift them up again. 
After this nothing happened.” He was not alone in describing 
the depth of despair as the end of history. “Nothing happened 
after that,” another Crow warrior said. “We just lived.” The 
emotion was so strong that the brain (B)  evidence of the 
continued existence of normal, everyday life that might have

37. Oil and gas resources are not likely to be impacted by 
climate change because they result from a process that takes 
millions of years and are geologically trapped. (A) , 
climate change may not only force the shutting down of oil- 
and gas-producing areas, but increase the possibility of 
exploration in areas of the Arctic through the reduction in ice 
cover. Thus, while climate change may not impact these 
resources, oil and gas reserves and known or potential 
resources could be affected by new climate conditions, since 
climate change may affect access to these resources. In 
Siberia, (B) , the actual exploration challenge is the 
time required to access, produce, and deliver oil under extreme 
environmental conditions, where temperatures in January 
range from —20℃ to —35℃. Warming may ease extreme 
environmental conditions, expanding the production frontier.

We tend to perceive the door of a classroom as 
rectangular no matter from which angle it is viewed. 
Actually, the rectangular door of a classroom projects a 
rectangular image on our retina only when it is viewed 
directly from the front.
(A) Slowly the trapezoid becomes thinner and thinner, and all 
that is projected on the retina is a vertical line, which is 
the thickness of the door. These changes we can observe 
and distinguish, but we do not accept them.
(B) Similarly, a round coin is seen as round even when 
viewed from an angle at which, objectively, it should 
appear elliptical. In the same way, we see car wheels as 
round, even though the retinal image is oval when viewed 
from an angle other than directly from the front.
(C) At other angles, the image will be seen as a trapezoid. 
The edge of the door towards us looks wider than the 
edge hinged with the frame.

So, when someone is threatening to go to war, or trying to 
convince us and mounting a huge public relations campaign 
to justify it, the news media have a responsibility to 
question everything.
It’s important that the media provide us with diverse and 
opposing views, so we can choose the best available options. 
Let’s take the example of going to war. ( ① ) War should be 
a last resort, obviously, undertaken when all other options 
have failed. ( ② ) They should be providing the most intense 
scrutiny on our behalf, so the public can see the other side of 
things. ( ③ ) Otherwise, we may be drawn into unnecessary 
wars, or wars fought for reasons other than those presented 
by governments and generals. ( ④ ) Most of the time, the 
media fail to perform this crucial role. ( ⑤ )  Even the large, 
so-called ‘liberal’ American media have admitted that they 
have not always been watchdogs for the public interest, and 
that their own coverage on some major issues “looks 
strikingly one-sided at times.”

Low-balling describes the technique where two 
individuals arrive at an agreement and then one increases 
the cost to be incurred by the other. For example, after the 
consumer has agreed to purchase a car for $8,000, the 
salesperson begins to add on $100 for tax and $200 for 
tires. These additional costs might be thought of as a 
metaphorical ‘low ball’ that the salesperson throws the 
consumer. One explanation for the effectiveness of 
low-balling is in terms of self-perception theory. When the 
consumer agrees to purchase the product under the original 
terms, that behavior might be used by the consumer to 
infer his sincere interest in the product. This inferred 
sincere interest in the product may enable him to endure 
the increased cost. An alternative explanation is in terms 
of impression management theory. If the consumer were 
to withdraw from the deal after the ‘slight’ change in the 
terms of agreement, he might foster the rather undesirable 
impression of being an irresponsible consumer unaware of 
these necessary charges.

There is a difference between getting what you want and 
getting what you think you want. Technology gives us more 
and more of what we think we want. These days, looking at 
sociable robots and digitized friends, one might assume that 
what we want is to be always in touch and never alone, no 
matter who or what we are in touch with. One might assume 
that what we want is plenty of weak ties, the informal 
networks that underpin online acquaintanceship. But if we 
pay attention to the real consequences of what we think we 
want, we may discover what we really want. We may want 
some stillness and solitude. As an American writer once put 
it, we may want to live less ‘thickly’ and wait for more 
infrequent but meaningful . As we 
put in our many hours of typing ― with all fingers or just 
thumbs ― we may discover that we miss the human voice. 
We may decide that it is fine to play chess with a robot, but 
that robots are unfit for any conversation about family or 
friends. A robot might have needs, but to understand desire, 
one needs language and flesh. We may decide that for these 
conversations, we must have a person who knows, firsthand, 
what it means to be born, to have parents and a family, to 
wish for love and perhaps children, and to anticipate death. 
And, of course, we must not let the virtual take us away from 
the real world that doesn’t go away with a power outage.

(A)
How much space do you need to be happy? Part of the 
American story is that bigger is better, and with cheap credit 
and tax breaks for home buyers, it’s tempting to stretch one’s 
finances to build or buy a larger house. My grandpa Otto 
chose a different path. (a) He didn’t want to find himself 
working longer and longer hours just to pay for more space 
and the stuff to fill it. He grew up in a farming community 
and within a very large family, so living simply was integral 
to his life philosophy.
(B)
Yet my grandpa loved his little home and was content with 
what he had. Even though the house was small, it didn’t feel 
cramped. As my dad said, “Everyone was happy and content. 
The size of the house didn’t matter.” My grandpa taught me 
that living a simple life isn’t about self-deprivation. Instead, 
it’s about giving yourself the time, freedom, and money to 
pursue your dreams. In many ways, I’ve modeled my life after 
that of my grandpa. I learned from (b) him that simplicity 
isn’t about austerity. It’s a revolution in personal growth. 
(C)
In the 1950s, when my dad was a little boy, my grandpa 
built a 600-square-foot cottage. (c) He put the twenty-by-
thirty-foot structure on a small plot of land in Pleasant Hill. 
Dad remarked, “Reusing and recycling was a necessity. In 
essence, (d) he was recycling before it became ‘cool.’” 
Grandpa got most of the materials for his little house from 
the Oakland docks, where he was working. It took four years 
to build the small cottage, and when they moved in, the roof 
wasn’t even on!
(D)
My dad recalled looking up at the stars in the roofless 
house as a twelve-year-old kid before falling asleep. Dad 
didn’t mind living in an unfinished house. (e) He described 
Pleasant Hill as “open and private. It felt like all the homes 
were on ten acres.” Over the years, my dad and grandpa 
noticed dramatic changes in their community. Each year 
more farmland was devoured to build strip malls and 
neighborhoods with larger homes. As real estate prices rose, 
many of their neighbors sold their homes and lots. Soon my 
grandpa had the only small house on the block, surrounded 
by a sea of homes four times the size of his dwelling.
