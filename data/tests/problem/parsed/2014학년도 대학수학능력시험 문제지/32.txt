32. The success of human beings depends crucially on numbers 
and connections. A few hundred people cannot sustain a 
sophisticated technology. Recall that Australia was colonized 
45,000 years ago by pioneers spreading east from Africa along 
the shore of Asia. The vanguard of such a migration must have 
been small in number and must have traveled comparatively 
light. The chances are they had only a sample of the 
technology available to their relatives back at the Red Sea 
crossing. This may explain why Australian aboriginal 
technology, although it developed and elaborated steadily over 
the ensuing millennia, was lacking in so many features of the 
Old World ― elastic weapons, for example, such as bows and 
catapults, were unknown, as were ovens. It was not that they 
were ‘primitive’ or that they had mentally regressed; it was 
that they  
and did not have a dense enough population and therefore a 
large enough collective brain to develop them much further. [3점]

① were too tightly connected to develop new technologies
② focused on developing and elaborating elastic weapons
③ had arrived with only a subset of technologies
④ inherited none of their relatives’ technologies in Africa
⑤ failed to transfer their technical insights to the Old World
