33. In all cultures in which eye-gaze behavior has been studied, 
science confirms that those who are dominant have more 
in using it. In essence, these individuals are 
entitled to look wherever they want. However, subordinates 
are more restricted in where they can look and when. Humility 
dictates that in the presence of royalty, as in church, heads are 
bowed. As a general rule, dominants tend to ignore 
subordinates visually while subordinates tend to gaze at 
dominant individuals at a distance. In other words, 
higher-status individuals can be indifferent while lower-status 
persons are required to be attentive with their gaze. The king 
is free to look at anyone he wants, but all subjects face the 
king, even as they back out of a room.  [3점]
