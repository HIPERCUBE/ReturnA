play a large role in the creation and implementation of the 
policy, and when utilitarian rationality is the dominant value 
that guides policy. Through the use of the scientific method to 
determine the facts of any given policy situation, the power of 
social constructions is supposedly diminished, and solutions to 
social problems are discovered in an objective way. This 
process creates an illusion of neutrality and implies a 
transcendence of the pitfalls and inequalities commonly 
associated with policymaking. From this perspective, scientists 
and professionals emerge as the appropriate experts to be 
consulted in policymaking, while local citizen input and 
knowledge is often viewed as unnecessary. Scientific and 
professional policy design does not necessarily escape the 
pitfalls of degenerative politics. Scientific and professional 
expertise often relies on a particular type of knowledge that is 
limited to utility and rationality considerations. This approach 
to policy typically does not consider values and cultural factors 
that cannot be measured empirically. Scientifically designed 
policies can serve interests that run counter to the public 
interest. They . [3점]
* transcendence: 초월
① reveal objective solutions to social problems
② can reinforce unequal and unjust relationships
③ may be free from the inequalities of policymaking
④ do stress cultural values rather than utilitarian ones
⑤ use empirically proven theories to reflect locals’ input
