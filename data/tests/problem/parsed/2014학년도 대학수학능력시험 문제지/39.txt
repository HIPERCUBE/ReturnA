So, when someone is threatening to go to war, or trying to 
convince us and mounting a huge public relations campaign 
to justify it, the news media have a responsibility to 
question everything.
It’s important that the media provide us with diverse and 
opposing views, so we can choose the best available options. 
Let’s take the example of going to war. ( ① ) War should be 
a last resort, obviously, undertaken when all other options 
have failed. ( ② ) They should be providing the most intense 
scrutiny on our behalf, so the public can see the other side of 
things. ( ③ ) Otherwise, we may be drawn into unnecessary 
wars, or wars fought for reasons other than those presented 
by governments and generals. ( ④ ) Most of the time, the 
media fail to perform this crucial role. ( ⑤ )  Even the large, 
so-called ‘liberal’ American media have admitted that they 
have not always been watchdogs for the public interest, and 
that their own coverage on some major issues “looks 
strikingly one-sided at times.”
