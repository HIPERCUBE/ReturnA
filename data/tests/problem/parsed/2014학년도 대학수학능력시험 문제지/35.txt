35. Mathematics will attract those it can attract, but it will do 
nothing to overcome resistance to science. Science is universal 
in principle but in practice it speaks to very few. Mathematics 
may be considered a communication skill of the highest type, 
frictionless so to speak; and at the opposite pole from 
mathematics, the fruits of science show the practical benefits of 
science without the use of words. But those fruits are 
ambivalent. Science as science does not speak; ideally, 
all scientific concepts are mathematized when scientists 
communicate with one another, and when science displays its 
products to non-scientists it need not, and indeed is not able to, 
resort to salesmanship. When science speaks to others, it is no 
longer science, and the scientist becomes or has to hire a 
publicist who dilutes the exactness of mathematics. In doing 
so, the scientist reverses his drive toward mathematical 
exactness in favor of rhetorical vagueness and metaphor, thus 
. [3점]
① degrading his ability to use the scientific language needed 
for good salesmanship
② surmounting the barrier to science by associating science 
with mathematics
③ inevitably making others who are unskillful in mathematics 
hostile to science
④ neglecting his duty of bridging the gap between science 
and the public
⑤ violating the code of intellectual conduct that defines him 
as a scientist
