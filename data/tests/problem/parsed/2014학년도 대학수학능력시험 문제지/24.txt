In order to successfully release himself from the control of 
his parents, a child must be secure in his parents’ power, as 
represented by their loving authority. The more effectively they 
communicate that authority, the more secure the child feels, and 
the better able he is to move away from them toward a life of his 
own. During this lengthy process, whenever he feels threatened, 
he turns back toward the safety of his parents’ love and 
authority. In other words, it is impossible for a child to 
successfully release himself unless he knows exactly where his 
parents stand, both literally and figuratively. That requires, of 
course, that his parents know where they themselves stand. If 
they don’t know where they stand ― if, in other words, they are 
insecure in their authority ― they cannot communicate security 
to their child, and he cannot move successfully away from 
them. Under the circumstances, he will become clingy, or 
disobedient, or both.
