In our efforts to be the good child, the uncomplaining 
employee, or the cooperative patient, many of us fall into the 
trap of trying to please people by going along with whatever 
they want us to do. At times, we lose track of our own 
boundaries and needs, and the cost of this could be our life, 
both symbolically and literally. When we are unable to set 
healthy limits, it causes distress in our relationships. But when 
we learn to say no to what we don’t feel like doing in order to 
say yes to our true self, we feel empowered, and our 
relationships with others improve. So don’t be afraid to say 
no. Try to catch yourself in the moment and use your true 
voice to say what you really want to say.
