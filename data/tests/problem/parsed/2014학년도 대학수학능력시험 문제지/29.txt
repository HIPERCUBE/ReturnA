average annual hours of seven age groups in 2007. ① In these 
groups, the volunteer rates ranged from 29% to 58%, and the 
Canadian average rate was 46%. ② The average annual hours 
increased with age except for the group aged between 25 and 
34, which volunteered an average of 133 hours. ③ The 15-24 
age group showed the highest volunteer rate but the second 
fewest average annual hours. ④ The 35-44 age group had 
fewer average annual hours than the 45-54 age group, while 
the 55-64 and 65-74 age groups showed the same average 
annual hours. ⑤ Despite their lowest rate of volunteering, 
seniors aged 75 and older gave more hours on average than 
any other age group.
