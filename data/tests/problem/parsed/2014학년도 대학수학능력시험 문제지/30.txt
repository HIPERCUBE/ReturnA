Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier was a French mathematician 
and physicist. When he was eight years old, his father died, and 
less than a year after this tragedy, his mother passed away, 
leaving him an orphan. A charitable lady helped him attend a 
local military school. He wanted to become an officer but was 
not allowed to because he was the son of a tailor. In 1795, he 
became a teacher at the École Normale in Paris. During the 
post-Revolution frenzy, he spoke out against the use of the 
guillotine, for which he almost lost his life. When Napoleon 
invaded Egypt in 1798, Fourier and other scholars accompanied 
the expedition. Having returned to France, Fourier began his 
research on heat conduction. His mathematical theory of heat 
conduction earned him lasting fame. During his stay in Egypt he 
contracted a strange illness that confined him to well-heated 
rooms for the rest of his life. On May 16, 1830, Fourier died in
Paris.
