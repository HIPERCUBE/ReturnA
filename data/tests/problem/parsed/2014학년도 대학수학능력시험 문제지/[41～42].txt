There is a difference between getting what you want and 
getting what you think you want. Technology gives us more 
and more of what we think we want. These days, looking at 
sociable robots and digitized friends, one might assume that 
what we want is to be always in touch and never alone, no 
matter who or what we are in touch with. One might assume 
that what we want is plenty of weak ties, the informal 
networks that underpin online acquaintanceship. But if we 
pay attention to the real consequences of what we think we 
want, we may discover what we really want. We may want 
some stillness and solitude. As an American writer once put 
it, we may want to live less ‘thickly’ and wait for more 
infrequent but meaningful . As we 
put in our many hours of typing ― with all fingers or just 
thumbs ― we may discover that we miss the human voice. 
We may decide that it is fine to play chess with a robot, but 
that robots are unfit for any conversation about family or 
friends. A robot might have needs, but to understand desire, 
one needs language and flesh. We may decide that for these 
conversations, we must have a person who knows, firsthand, 
what it means to be born, to have parents and a family, to 
wish for love and perhaps children, and to anticipate death. 
And, of course, we must not let the virtual take us away from 
the real world that doesn’t go away with a power outage.
