37. Oil and gas resources are not likely to be impacted by 
climate change because they result from a process that takes 
millions of years and are geologically trapped. (A) , 
climate change may not only force the shutting down of oil- 
and gas-producing areas, but increase the possibility of 
exploration in areas of the Arctic through the reduction in ice 
cover. Thus, while climate change may not impact these 
resources, oil and gas reserves and known or potential 
resources could be affected by new climate conditions, since 
climate change may affect access to these resources. In 
Siberia, (B) , the actual exploration challenge is the 
time required to access, produce, and deliver oil under extreme 
environmental conditions, where temperatures in January 
range from —20℃ to —35℃. Warming may ease extreme 
environmental conditions, expanding the production frontier.
