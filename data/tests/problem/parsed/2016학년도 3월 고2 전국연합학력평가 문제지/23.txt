Anne Mangen at the University of Oslo studied the 
performance of readers of a computer screen compared to 
readers of paper. Her investigation indicated that reading on 
a computer screen involves various strategies from browsing 
to simple word detection. Those different strategies together 
lead to poorer reading comprehension in contrast to reading 
the same texts on paper. Moreover, there is an additional 
feature of the screen: hypertext. Above all, a hypertext 
connection is not one that you have made yourself, and it 
will not necessarily have a place in your own unique 
conceptual framework. Therefore, it may not help you 
understand and digest what you’re reading at your own 
appropriate pace, and it may even distract you.
