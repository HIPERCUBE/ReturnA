Jake’s own flying dream began at a village festival. He 
was four years old. His uncle, a tall silent pilot, had bought 
① him a red party balloon from a charity stall, and tied it to 
the top button of Jake’s shirt. The balloon seemed to have a 
mind of its own. It was filled with helium, a gas four times 
lighter than air, though Jake did not understand this at the 
time. It pulled mysteriously at ② his button. “Maybe you will 
fly,” Jake’s uncle remarked. He led ③ his nephew up a 
grassy bank so they could look over the whole festival. 
Below Jake stretched the little tents and the stalls. Above 
④ him bobbed the big red balloon, shiny and beautiful. It 
kept pulling him towards the sky, and ⑤ he began to feel 
unsteady on his feet. Then his uncle let go of his hand, and 
Jake’s dream began.
