32. Imagine this scene. There are six people in an elevator 
with an actor hired by researchers. The actor drops a bunch 
of coins and pencils. They fall to the floor with a clatter. 
And then, as the elevator goes down floor by floor, not one 
person moves a muscle to help. The people in the elevator 
have to notice the actor picking up the coins and pencils on 
the floor. Some people may feel uncomfortable and might 
silently wonder whether to get involved. But each person is 
surrounded by five others who are doing nothing. If the 
people knew they were being tested, every one would 
instantly come to the aid of the stranger. But in the context 
of everyday life, where people are not thinking deliberately 
about how others are influencing them,                  just 
feels like the natural thing to do. [3점]
