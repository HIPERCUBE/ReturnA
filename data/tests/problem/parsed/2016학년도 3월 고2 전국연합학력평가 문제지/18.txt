To the Student Council,
We are the members of the 11th grade band. 
Currently, since we have no practice room of our own, 
we have to practice twice a week in the multipurpose 
room. For the past two weeks, band practice has been 
canceled because other groups needed to use the room. 
Since the band tournament is only one month away, 
we are asking to be the only group to use the 
multipurpose room after school for this entire month. 
Principal Cooper has said that the entire student 
council must vote on our proposal. We hope that you 
will understand our situation and vote in our favor.
Sincerely,
The 11th Grade Band
