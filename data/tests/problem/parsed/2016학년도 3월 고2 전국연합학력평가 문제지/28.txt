28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
When I was young, my parents worshipped medical doctors 
as if they were exceptional beings ① possessing godlike 
qualities. But I never dreamed of pursuing a career in 
medicine until I entered the hospital for a rare disease. I 
became a medical curiosity, attracting some of the area’s top 
specialists to look in on me and ② review my case. As a 
patient, and a teenager ③ eager to return to college, I asked 
each doctor who examined me, “What caused my disease?” 
“How will you make me better?” The typical response was 
nonverbal. They shook their heads and walked out of my 
room. I remember ④ thinking to myself, “Well, I could do 
that.” When it became clear to me ⑤ what no doctor could 
answer my basic questions, I walked out of the hospital 
against medical advice. Returning to college, I pursued 
medicine with a great passion.
