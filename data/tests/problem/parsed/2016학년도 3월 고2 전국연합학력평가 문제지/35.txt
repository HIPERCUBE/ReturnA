For some people, there is an irony to success. Many 
people who achieve great success don’t always feel it.
(A) Achievement is something you reach or attain, like a 
goal. It is something tangible, clearly defined and 
measurable. It comes when you pursue and obtain what 
you want.
(B) Success, in contrast, is a feeling or a state of being. 
“She feels successful. She is successful,” we say, using 
the verb to be to suggest this state of being.
(C) For example, some who achieve fame talk about the 
loneliness that often goes with it. That’s because 
success and achievement are not the same thing, yet 
too often we mistake one for the other.
