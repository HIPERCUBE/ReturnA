I once worked with a group of students in the final year 
of senior school, who listened out for the slang used in 
their school.
Slang is actually quite difficult for linguists to find out 
about. You will have your local slang that you use in your 
school or in your town, and there’s no way I would ever 
know about it unless you told me what it was. ( ① ) 
Indeed, in your area you’ll probably have several different 
kinds of slang. ( ② ) The slang that kids use in primary 
school is likely to be different from what is used in 
secondary school. ( ③ ) If your town has several schools, 
there are often differences in the kind of slang heard in 
each school. ( ④ ) And there may even be words that are 
used differently within a single school. ( ⑤ ) They found 
that the slang used by first­year students was very different 
from their own.
