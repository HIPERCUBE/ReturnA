By contrast, the Flipped Learning model shifts instruction 
to a learner­centered approach, where in­class time is 
spent exploring topics in greater depth.
Flipped Learning allows for a variety of learning modes. 
( ① ) Educators often physically rearrange their learning 
spaces to support either group work or independent study. 
( ② ) They create flexible spaces in which students 
choose when and where they learn. ( ③ ) Furthermore, 
educators who flip their classes are flexible in their 
expectations of student timelines for learning and in their 
assessments of student learning. ( ④ ) In the traditional 
teacher­centered model, the teacher is the primary source 
of information. ( ⑤ ) As a result, students are actively 
involved in knowledge construction as they participate in 
and evaluate their learning in a personally meaningful 
manner. [3점]
