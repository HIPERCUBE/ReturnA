19. 다음 글에 드러난 Joni의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Joni went horseback riding with her older sisters. She had

horses, thought it was exciting to cross the river at the 
deepest part. They never seemed to notice that Joni’s little 
pony sank a bit deeper. It had rained earlier that week and

the middle of the river, Joni turned pale, staring at the 
swirling waters rushing around the legs of her pony. Her 
heart started to race and her mouth became dry.
