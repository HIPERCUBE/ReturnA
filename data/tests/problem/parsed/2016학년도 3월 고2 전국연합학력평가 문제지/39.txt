Both mammals and birds are noisy creatures. They 
commonly make their presence felt, and communicate, by 
sound, but birds are far better at it. ① Many mammals 
produce different sounds for different objects, but few can 
match the range of meaningful sounds that birds may give 
voice to. ② Apart from human beings, mammals on the 
whole are not melodious and there is little evidence that 
they intend to be. ③ Some mammals bellow, but few sing, 
apart from human beings and perhaps whales. ④ Some 
mammals are different in where they live, how they move 
around and what they eat. ⑤ Yet many birds are famed for 
their songs and some of the most glorious songsters are the 
ones we encounter most often.
* bellow: 큰 소리로 울부짖다
