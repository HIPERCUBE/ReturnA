who should be treated for various conditions. For example, 
expert committees in Europe and the United States set 
different guidelines about when to treat high blood pressure. 
The group of American experts believed that for mild 
elevation of blood pressure the benefits exceeded the risks 
from treatment. They wrote guidelines suggesting that 
patients with mild blood pressure elevation take medicine. 
But in Europe, an expert committee with access to the same 
scientific data set different guidelines that don’t advise 
treatment for mild elevation of blood pressure. In Europe, 
people with the same symptoms would not be encouraged to 
take medicine. Different groups of experts can disagree 
significantly about what is “best practice.” [3점]
