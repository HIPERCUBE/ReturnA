If you ask someone to name three sports, most likely he 
or she will be able to answer with ease. After all, nearly 
everyone has an idea about what types of activities are 
regarded as sports and which are not. Most of us think we 
know what sports are. (A) , the line drawn between 
examples of sports, leisure, and play is not always clear. In 
fact, devising a definition that establishes clear and clean 
parameters around what types of activities should be 
included and excluded is relatively difficult to do. Activities 
that are regarded as play today may gain the status of sport 
in the future. (B) , many people once played 
badminton in their backyards but this activity was hardly 
considered a sport. Since 1992, however, badminton has 
been an Olympic sport!
