To the Student Council,
We are the members of the 11th grade band. 
Currently, since we have no practice room of our own, 
we have to practice twice a week in the multipurpose 
room. For the past two weeks, band practice has been 
canceled because other groups needed to use the room. 
Since the band tournament is only one month away, 
we are asking to be the only group to use the 
multipurpose room after school for this entire month. 
Principal Cooper has said that the entire student 
council must vote on our proposal. We hope that you 
will understand our situation and vote in our favor.
Sincerely,
The 11th Grade Band

19. 다음 글에 드러난 Joni의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Joni went horseback riding with her older sisters. She had 
a hard time keeping up with them because her pony was 
half the size of their horses. Her sisters, on their big 
horses, thought it was exciting to cross the river at the 
deepest part. They never seemed to notice that Joni’s little 
pony sank a bit deeper. It had rained earlier that week and 
the river was brown and swollen. As her pony walked into 
the middle of the river, Joni turned pale, staring at the 
swirling waters rushing around the legs of her pony. Her 
heart started to race and her mouth became dry.

20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Think back to when you were a kid. How did you play? 
How did using your imagination make you feel? Being 
imaginative gives us feelings of happiness and adds 
excitement to our lives. It’s time to get back to those 
emotions. If you can return to the joyful feelings that you 
had through play, you’ll find that you feel happier about 
yourself. You can use your imagination to write books or 
invent something. There is no end to how creative you can 
be when you move into your imagination. It will also keep 
you focused on completing the tasks at hand because 
imagination makes everyday tasks more interesting.
① 다양한 취미 활동을 통해 경험의 폭을 넓혀라.
② 어린 시절처럼 생활 속에서 상상력을 발휘하라.
③ 생활 속에서 즐거움을 찾는 방법을 이웃과 나눠라.
④ 아이들의 눈높이에 맞추어 아이들의 행동을 이해하라.
21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Curiosity is the essence of life. Animals including humans 
cannot live without knowing what is useful to them and what 
is needed for their survival: where to find food, how to 
avoid predators, where to find mates, etc. However, the 
human species differs from other animals because we thirst 
for knowledge that reaches far beyond our personal needs. 
We look around us and we wonder. We wonder about our 
surroundings and about what we observe both near and far 
and we want to understand it all. Indeed, we fear the 
unknown. This sense of wonder and desire for understanding 
not only makes us human, but is also one of the foundation 
stones of civilization.

② 인간의 호기심은 오랜 진화 과정의 산물이다.
③ 사물과 현상에 대한 이해는 사람마다 다를 수 있다.
④ 호기심과 앎에 대한 욕구가 인간다움과 문명의 바탕이다.
⑤ 미지의 것에 대한 두려움은 비합리적인 사고로 이어진다.
22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Advertising experts have learned that the commercials that 
we remember will hook us into a story. Think about some 
of the most memorable and effective advertisements of all 
time, whether in the form of a printed page or 30­second 
spot on television. They involved an impressive storyline. 
Apple Computer’s classic “Think Different” campaign is 
widely considered the best ad of all time because it so 
dramatically told a powerful story. Coca Cola’s “Mean Joe 
Green” commercial is another example of a story, in which a 
little boy meets his hero. The goal in all these scenarios is 
to move people, emotionally and personally, creating a close 
association with the product that is positive and familiar.
* spot: 방송 프로그램 사이에 끼워 넣는 광고
① various lengths of commercials
② roles of ads in increasing sales
③ differences between ads and campaigns
④ uses of personal storytelling in education
23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
Anne Mangen at the University of Oslo studied the 
performance of readers of a computer screen compared to 
readers of paper. Her investigation indicated that reading on 
a computer screen involves various strategies from browsing 
to simple word detection. Those different strategies together 
lead to poorer reading comprehension in contrast to reading 
the same texts on paper. Moreover, there is an additional 
feature of the screen: hypertext. Above all, a hypertext 
connection is not one that you have made yourself, and it 
will not necessarily have a place in your own unique 
conceptual framework. Therefore, it may not help you 
understand and digest what you’re reading at your own 
appropriate pace, and it may even distract you.

25. teak에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Teak is among the most prized of the tropical hardwoods. 
It is native to India, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is a 
leaf­losing species that requires an annual dry season, so it 
is not found in the true rainforests. The wood of teak is 
particularly attractive, having a golden or reddish brown 
color. Teak is strong, making it a valued wood in 
shipbuilding and for high­quality furniture. One problem with 
harvesting teak is that the wood is very dense, so that 
when it is first felled and has not been dried it sinks in 
water. It cannot be moved out of forests by floating down 
rivers unless the wood has been dried first.

When I was young, my parents worshipped medical doctors 
as if they were exceptional beings ① possessing godlike 
qualities. But I never dreamed of pursuing a career in 
medicine until I entered the hospital for a rare disease. I 
became a medical curiosity, attracting some of the area’s top 
specialists to look in on me and ② review my case. As a 
patient, and a teenager ③ eager to return to college, I asked 
each doctor who examined me, “What caused my disease?” 
“How will you make me better?” The typical response was 
nonverbal. They shook their heads and walked out of my 
room. I remember ④ thinking to myself, “Well, I could do 
that.” When it became clear to me ⑤ what no doctor could 
answer my basic questions, I walked out of the hospital 
against medical advice. Returning to college, I pursued 
medicine with a great passion.

Do you know one of the best remedies for coping with 
family tension? Two words: “I’m sorry.” It’s amazing how 
hard some people find them to say. They think it implies 
weakness or defeat. Nothing of the kind. In fact, it is 
exactly the (A) same / opposite . Another good way of 
relieving tension is a row! The sea is ever so much calmer 
after a storm. A row has another (B) advantage / disadvantage . 
When tempers are raised, unspoken truths usually come out. 
They may hurt a bit, especially at the time. Yet, at the end, 
you know each other a bit better. Lastly, most of the 
tensions and quarrels between children are (C) natural / risky . 
Even when they seem to be constant, wise parents don’t 
worry too much.

③ opposite …… advantage …… risky

Jake’s own flying dream began at a village festival. He 
was four years old. His uncle, a tall silent pilot, had bought 
① him a red party balloon from a charity stall, and tied it to 
the top button of Jake’s shirt. The balloon seemed to have a 
mind of its own. It was filled with helium, a gas four times 
lighter than air, though Jake did not understand this at the 
time. It pulled mysteriously at ② his button. “Maybe you will 
fly,” Jake’s uncle remarked. He led ③ his nephew up a 
grassy bank so they could look over the whole festival. 
Below Jake stretched the little tents and the stalls. Above 
④ him bobbed the big red balloon, shiny and beautiful. It 
kept pulling him towards the sky, and ⑤ he began to feel 
unsteady on his feet. Then his uncle let go of his hand, and 
Jake’s dream began.

31. You can actually become your own cheerleader by talking 
to yourself positively and then acting as if you were already 
the person that you wanted to be. Act as though you were 
trying out for the role of a positive, cheerful, happy, and 
likable person. Walk, talk, and act as if you were already 
that person. Treat everyone you meet as though you had 
just won an award for being the very best person in your 
industry or as though you had just won the lottery. You will 
be amazed at how much better you feel about yourself after 
just a few minutes of                .

32. Imagine this scene. There are six people in an elevator 
with an actor hired by researchers. The actor drops a bunch 
of coins and pencils. They fall to the floor with a clatter. 
And then, as the elevator goes down floor by floor, not one 
person moves a muscle to help. The people in the elevator 
have to notice the actor picking up the coins and pencils on 
the floor. Some people may feel uncomfortable and might 
silently wonder whether to get involved. But each person is 
surrounded by five others who are doing nothing. If the 
people knew they were being tested, every one would 
instantly come to the aid of the stranger. But in the context 
of everyday life, where people are not thinking deliberately 
about how others are influencing them,                  just 
feels like the natural thing to do. [3점]

① finding fault with others
② maximizing material gains

33. Patients should be aware that                    about 
who should be treated for various conditions. For example, 
expert committees in Europe and the United States set 
different guidelines about when to treat high blood pressure. 
The group of American experts believed that for mild 
elevation of blood pressure the benefits exceeded the risks 
from treatment. They wrote guidelines suggesting that 
patients with mild blood pressure elevation take medicine. 
But in Europe, an expert committee with access to the same 
scientific data set different guidelines that don’t advise 
treatment for mild elevation of blood pressure. In Europe, 
people with the same symptoms would not be encouraged to 
take medicine. Different groups of experts can disagree 
significantly about what is “best practice.” [3점]

① there is a universal guideline
② there can be moral considerations
③ their family is responsible for the decision
④ there can be differing views among specialists
⑤ they benefit from following their doctors’ advice

If you ask someone to name three sports, most likely he 
or she will be able to answer with ease. After all, nearly 
everyone has an idea about what types of activities are 
regarded as sports and which are not. Most of us think we 
know what sports are. (A) , the line drawn between 
examples of sports, leisure, and play is not always clear. In 
fact, devising a definition that establishes clear and clean 
parameters around what types of activities should be 
included and excluded is relatively difficult to do. Activities 
that are regarded as play today may gain the status of sport 
in the future. (B) , many people once played 
badminton in their backyards but this activity was hardly 
considered a sport. Since 1992, however, badminton has 
been an Olympic sport!

For some people, there is an irony to success. Many 
people who achieve great success don’t always feel it.
(A) Achievement is something you reach or attain, like a 
goal. It is something tangible, clearly defined and 
measurable. It comes when you pursue and obtain what 
you want.
(B) Success, in contrast, is a feeling or a state of being. 
“She feels successful. She is successful,” we say, using 
the verb to be to suggest this state of being.
(C) For example, some who achieve fame talk about the 
loneliness that often goes with it. That’s because 
success and achievement are not the same thing, yet 
too often we mistake one for the other.

Every day in each of my classes I randomly select 
two students who are given the title of “official 
questioners.” These students are assigned the 
responsibility to ask at least one question during that 
class.
(A) In a serious tone, she answered that she’d been 
extremely nervous when I appointed her at the 
beginning of class. But then, during that class, she felt 
differently from how she’d felt during other lectures.
(B) After being the day’s official questioner, one of my 
students, Carrie, visited me in my office. Just to break 
the ice, I asked in a lighthearted way, “Did you feel 
honored to be named one of the first ‘official 
questioners’ of the semester?”
(C) It was a lecture just like the others, but this time, she 
said, she was forced to have a higher level of 
consciousness; she was more aware of the content of 
the lecture and discussion. She also admitted that as a 
result she got more out of that class.

I once worked with a group of students in the final year 
of senior school, who listened out for the slang used in 
their school.
Slang is actually quite difficult for linguists to find out 
about. You will have your local slang that you use in your 
school or in your town, and there’s no way I would ever 
know about it unless you told me what it was. ( ① ) 
Indeed, in your area you’ll probably have several different 
kinds of slang. ( ② ) The slang that kids use in primary 
school is likely to be different from what is used in 
secondary school. ( ③ ) If your town has several schools, 
there are often differences in the kind of slang heard in 
each school. ( ④ ) And there may even be words that are 
used differently within a single school. ( ⑤ ) They found 
that the slang used by first­year students was very different 
from their own.

By contrast, the Flipped Learning model shifts instruction 
to a learner­centered approach, where in­class time is 
spent exploring topics in greater depth.
Flipped Learning allows for a variety of learning modes. 
( ① ) Educators often physically rearrange their learning 
spaces to support either group work or independent study. 
( ② ) They create flexible spaces in which students 
choose when and where they learn. ( ③ ) Furthermore, 
educators who flip their classes are flexible in their 
expectations of student timelines for learning and in their 
assessments of student learning. ( ④ ) In the traditional 
teacher­centered model, the teacher is the primary source 
of information. ( ⑤ ) As a result, students are actively 
involved in knowledge construction as they participate in 
and evaluate their learning in a personally meaningful 
manner. [3점]

Both mammals and birds are noisy creatures. They 
commonly make their presence felt, and communicate, by 
sound, but birds are far better at it. ① Many mammals 
produce different sounds for different objects, but few can 
match the range of meaningful sounds that birds may give 
voice to. ② Apart from human beings, mammals on the 
whole are not melodious and there is little evidence that 
they intend to be. ③ Some mammals bellow, but few sing, 
apart from human beings and perhaps whales. ④ Some 
mammals are different in where they live, how they move 
around and what they eat. ⑤ Yet many birds are famed for 
their songs and some of the most glorious songsters are the 
ones we encounter most often.

When I was in eighth grade, we were studying 
longitude and latitude in geography class. Every day for 
a week, we had a quiz, and I kept getting longitude and 
latitude confused. I went home and almost cried because 
I was so frustrated and embarrassed that I couldn’t keep 
them straight in my mind. I stared and stared at those 
words until suddenly I figured out what to do. I told 
myself, when you see that n in longitude it will remind 
you of the word north. Therefore, it will be easy to 
remember that longitude lines go from north to south. It 
worked; I got them all right on the next quiz, and the 
next, and on the test.

Today’s consumers are not just looking for a good 
product at a fair price. They are looking beyond the 
product or service to the ethics of the company that 
supplies it. The shift in focus by consumers is evident 
in their concerns about the companies they purchase 
from. For example, there is growing interest in labor 
practices, environmental policies, and social 
responsibilities. Also, there is a pressure to get 
companies to present not just financial results, but also 
social and environmental results and impact. Companies 
need to respond to the pressure because customers are 
voicing their concerns in every way, from boycotting 
stores to suing companies. Some multinational companies 
have experienced the       of ethical consumers in 
recent years, and have been forced to respond quickly to 
protect their reputations and their existence as 
companies.
This growing emphasis on ethical consumption is a 
trend that cannot be ignored. It is not going to go away. 
There are some important changes in the world 
indicating that ethical consumers will continue to be a 
growing force in the next few decades. Companies would 
do well to understand this trend and make efforts to 
deal with it.

[43 ~ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
William Miller stayed up after the family had gone to 
bed, then read until the morning. Candles were 
expensive, but there were plenty of pine knots, and all 
(a) he had to do was gather them from the woods. So 
William formed the habit of burning pine knots in the 
fireplace for his nightly reading light.
* pine knot: 관솔(송진이 엉긴 소나무의 옹이)
(B)
William’s “secret life” continued for some time, though. 
Night after night he read as long as he could, then made 
(b) his way back upstairs, and slept until it was time to 
do the morning chores. But one night something 
happened that he hadn’t expected. His father awoke and 
saw a glow downstairs. Thinking the house was on fire, 
(c) he came rushing down the stairs to save his home 
and family from going up in flames.
(C)
Instead of a house fire, however, he saw his son 
William lying peacefully before the fireplace reading a 
book he’d borrowed from a neighbor. His father grabbed 
a broomstick and chased his son around the room, 
yelling, “Young man, if you don’t get to bed right now, 
I’ll kick you out of the house!” William went up to bed, 
at least for this night. (d) He was only trying to get an 
education that he couldn’t get from the teachers in the 
community.
(D)
But his father didn’t like the habit and tried to stop it. 
His father felt that his son’s late­night reading would cut 
into (e) his energy for the next day’s work. And the 
farm required every ounce of work he could get from his 
son. He insisted that William retire for the night when 
the rest of the family did. And his father thought the 
growing boy should sleep soundly through the night.
