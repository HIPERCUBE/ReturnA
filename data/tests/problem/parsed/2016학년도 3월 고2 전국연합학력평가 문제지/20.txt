Think back to when you were a kid. How did you play? 
How did using your imagination make you feel? Being 
imaginative gives us feelings of happiness and adds 
excitement to our lives. It’s time to get back to those 
emotions. If you can return to the joyful feelings that you 
had through play, you’ll find that you feel happier about 
yourself. You can use your imagination to write books or 
invent something. There is no end to how creative you can 
be when you move into your imagination. It will also keep 
you focused on completing the tasks at hand because 
imagination makes everyday tasks more interesting.
