36.
Every day in each of my classes I randomly select 
two students who are given the title of “official 
questioners.” These students are assigned the 
responsibility to ask at least one question during that 
class.
(A) In a serious tone, she answered that she’d been 
extremely nervous when I appointed her at the 
beginning of class. But then, during that class, she felt 
differently from how she’d felt during other lectures.
(B) After being the day’s official questioner, one of my 
students, Carrie, visited me in my office. Just to break 
the ice, I asked in a lighthearted way, “Did you feel 
honored to be named one of the first ‘official 
questioners’ of the semester?”
(C) It was a lecture just like the others, but this time, she 
said, she was forced to have a higher level of 
consciousness; she was more aware of the content of 
the lecture and discussion. She also admitted that as a 
result she got more out of that class.
