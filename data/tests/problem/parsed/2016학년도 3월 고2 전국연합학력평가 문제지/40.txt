When I was in eighth grade, we were studying 
longitude and latitude in geography class. Every day for 
a week, we had a quiz, and I kept getting longitude and 
latitude confused. I went home and almost cried because 
I was so frustrated and embarrassed that I couldn’t keep 
them straight in my mind. I stared and stared at those 
words until suddenly I figured out what to do. I told 
myself, when you see that n in longitude it will remind 
you of the word north. Therefore, it will be easy to 
remember that longitude lines go from north to south. It 
worked; I got them all right on the next quiz, and the 
next, and on the test.
* longitude: 경도    ** latitude: 위도
