Teak is among the most prized of the tropical hardwoods. 
It is native to India, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is a 
leaf­losing species that requires an annual dry season, so it 
is not found in the true rainforests. The wood of teak is 
particularly attractive, having a golden or reddish brown 
color. Teak is strong, making it a valued wood in 
shipbuilding and for high­quality furniture. One problem with 
harvesting teak is that the wood is very dense, so that 
when it is first felled and has not been dried it sinks in 
water. It cannot be moved out of forests by floating down 
rivers unless the wood has been dried first.
