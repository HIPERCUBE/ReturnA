Advertising experts have learned that the commercials that 
we remember will hook us into a story. Think about some 
of the most memorable and effective advertisements of all 
time, whether in the form of a printed page or 30­second 
spot on television. They involved an impressive storyline. 
Apple Computer’s classic “Think Different” campaign is 
widely considered the best ad of all time because it so 
dramatically told a powerful story. Coca Cola’s “Mean Joe 
Green” commercial is another example of a story, in which a 
little boy meets his hero. The goal in all these scenarios is 
to move people, emotionally and personally, creating a close 
association with the product that is positive and familiar.
