(A)
Many people make the decision to become a teacher after 
having a deep personal experience with a teacher. I once 
asked an elementary school teacher, Sera, why she chose a　
career in that field, and she told me that (a) she had a 
learning disability when she was growing up and did　not have 
a very easy time in school. She went on to tell me how many 
classmates had called her stupid and made fun of her, and how she had felt when she couldn’t find any help. 
(B)
Once she was diagnosed as dyslexic and began using some 
alternative ways to learn, (b) she actually started liking 
school and doing better. That teacher made a huge difference 
in that　girl’s life. Sera decided that even if it was hard, she 
was going to find a way to help other children. From that 
moment on (c) she was determined to work hard and find a 
way to become a teacher. * dyslexic: 난독증이 있는
(C)
When Sera was in sixth grade, however, she met a teacher 
who changed her life. During a class, the teacher asked the 
girl to　answer a question about a story she had just asked 
the students to read. The girl didn’t know the answer and　
the teacher realized something was wrong. (d) She asked the girl to stay after class.
(D)
When they were　 alone, Sera said, “I’m stupid. Everyone 
says so. I’m sorry, but this is the best I can do.” The kind　
teacher told her that (e) she was not stupid. She told the girl 
that perhaps she just needed to learn things in a different 
way and she was going to help her. The teacher told the 
problem to the school counselor and made sure the girl was tested. It　turned out she was dyslexic.
