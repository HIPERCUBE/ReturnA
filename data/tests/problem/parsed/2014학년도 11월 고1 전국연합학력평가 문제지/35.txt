35. Hiding behind a barrier is a normal response we learn at an 
early age to protect ourselves. ① As children, we hid behind 
solid objects such as furniture or our mother’s skirt whenever we 
found ourselves in a threatening situation. ② As we grew older, 
this hiding behavior became more sophisticated. ③ Adults were 
found to use a wide variety of strategies to protect their 
children. ④ As adults, we fold one or both arms across the 
chest in an unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive 
as a threat or undesirable circumstances. ⑤ Women’s use of 
arm barriers is less noticeable than men’s because women can 
grasp on to things like handbags or purses.
