To prove this wrong, Newton reversed the process.
In the late 1600s, Sir Issac Newton conducted a series of 
experiments involving prisms, light, and color, which form the 
basis of our current understanding of color. ( ① ) These 
experiments involved refracting white light through a prism ― a 
simple triangular glass object that separates light waves into 
individual colors. ( ② ) The results revealed that light could 
actually be broken down into seven individual colors: red, 
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. ( ③ ) Until this 
discovery, it was assumed that a prism somehow “colored” the 
light passing through it. ( ④ ) He projected the colors back 
into the prism, which resulted in pure white light. ( ⑤ ) 
Artists and scientists alike were amazed by this discovery that 
light is the source of all color.
