When Paul Dver was a high school student, he met comedian 
Soupy Sales and became friends with him. ① He even 
occasionally talked to the comedian on the telephone. Paul 
would tell his fellow high school students that ② he was friends 
with Soupy Sales, and of course they didn’t believe him. One 
day, ③ he asked Soupy for a favor. Paul and his friends were 
appearing in a play, and ④ he asked Soupy to record an 
advertisement for him because if it were recorded in Soupy’s 
voice, the local radio station would play it. Soupy did more than 
just record the advertisement as written. ⑤ He threw in some 
ad-libs and made it funny. Of course, Paul’s high school friends 
were amazed to hear Soupy’s voice on the radio advertising 
Paul and his friends’ play.
* ad-lib: 애드리브, 즉흥 연기
