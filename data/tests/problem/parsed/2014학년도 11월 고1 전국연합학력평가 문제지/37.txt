Imagine that a study on the effects of drinking coffee 
comes out in the news. The study suggests that drinking at 
least three cups a day significantly improves attention and 
memory.
(A) Then she reads a newer study that says drinking more 
than two cups of coffee a day is linked to significantly 
decreased attention and heightened anxiety. 
(B) A woman reads this study and immediately increases her 
morning coffee ritual to three cups. For the next month 
she thinks she is more attentive and remembering things 
better because she’s drinking more coffee. 
(C) The second study has been promoted as actively as the 
first, and is equally convincing. She thinks, “I have been 
feeling more anxious lately, and maybe I’m not as focused 
as I thought,” and she decreases her coffee intake down to 
two cups.
