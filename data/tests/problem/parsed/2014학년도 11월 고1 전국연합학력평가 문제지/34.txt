34. 다음 글에 드러난 Charlie의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Charlie knew something was wrong. The lake was gone. He 
paused and scanned the field, but he could not see anything

unexpected and loud, startled him, so he began to run away. 
Then another dog was barking, and another, and he had no idea 
where the dogs were. He was terribly frightened and he ran 
with increasing awkwardness, tearing at the weeds with his 
hands, pulling at the air, so that everything about him seemed 
to be running except his slow feet. The sound of the dogs 
seemed to be all around him, even getting louder.
