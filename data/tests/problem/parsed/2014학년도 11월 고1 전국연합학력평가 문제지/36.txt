36. Globalization has resulted in a global brain drain, which refers 
to the situation in which countries lose their best educated 
workers. ① A report released by the Arab League in 2009 
found that roughly 100,000 scientists, doctors, and engineers 
were leaving countries in the Middle East and North Africa every 
year, with most of the scientists and doctors never returning. 
② Another study suggested that vast numbers of developing 
countries’ doctors were working abroad, including 41% from 
Jamaica and 30% from Ghana. ③ Many doctors have searched 
for the causes of a rare brain disease. ④ The brain drain has 
even worried some wealthy countries. ⑤ The government of 
New Zealand, for instance, launched a program in 2006 to try 
to attract its professionals living abroad back home.
