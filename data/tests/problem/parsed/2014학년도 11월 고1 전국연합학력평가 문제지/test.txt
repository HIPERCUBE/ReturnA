Dear readers,
Thank you for your subscription to The Kitchens! 
Please take a moment to read this message. We want to 
ask you to recycle this magazine for pick-up once 
you’ve finished tearing out all the ideas in it for your 
“dream kitchen” file. Today, only about 20 percent of 
magazines are recycled from the home, and we want to 
change that. By increasing magazine recycling, we can 
reduce the amount of new fiber that must be obtained 
from wood, meaning that fewer trees will have to be cut 
down. Recycle today and always.

As adults, we have a responsibility to teach children to 
respect and interact with animals in a positive way. Children 
love animals; they are fascinated by them and can develop very 
special connections and relationships with them. At the same 
time, they need to be taught how to interact with animals and, 
most importantly, when to leave the animals alone. Children 
must be taught not to chase the family dog or cat, or the wild 
birds and rabbits at the park. Such lessons help to establish a 
strong love and respect for all living things ― animals can play 
a huge role in the development of compassion and understanding 
for our fellow human beings.

20. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? 
One of the best things you can do to get support for your 
dream is to support somebody else’s first. When you run into a 
wall of resistance or indifference from friends and family 
members, stop asking, “How can I get them to be a fan of my 
dream?” Instead, ask, “How can I be a fan of their dream?” Tell 
your friend who doesn’t get what you’re trying to do, “I’ve 
explained my dream a few times, but never asked you, what’s 
yours?” If you want help for your dream, start by helping 
someone else with theirs. If you want support for your hope, 
start by giving support to someone else’s hope. Giving support 
is often the best way to get it.

④ 다른 사람을 돕는 것을 통해 인생의 진정한 행복을 찾을 수 있다.

Several studies have found that pet owners have lower blood 
pressure, a reduced risk of heart disease, and lower levels of 
stress. Pets can also be a plus in the workplace. A study found 
that in the course of workday, stress levels decreased for 
workers who brought in their dogs. The differences in 
perceived stress between days the dog was present and absent 
were significant. The employees as a whole had a higher job 
satisfaction than industry norms. Having a dog in the office had 
a positive effect on the general atmosphere, relieving stress 
and making everyone around happier. Pet presence may serve 
as a low-cost wellness solution readily available to many 
organizations.

22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Across the developing world today, the “mobile health” 
revolution ― mobile phones used as tools for healthcare ― is 
responsible for a number of improvements. Mobile phones are 
now used to connect patients to doctors, to monitor drug 
distribution, and to share basic health information that isn’t 
available locally. Mobile phones are tools to send reminders 
about medication and appointments to patients. The central 
problems of health sectors in poor places ― clinics without 
enough staff, patients in remote places, too few medications or 
inefficient distribution of them, and misinformation about 
vaccines and disease prevention ― will all find at least partial 
solutions through connectivity.

① dangers of the mobile phone revolution
② benefits of mobile phones in healthcare
③ limitations of mobile healthcare service
④ ways to improve medical device connectivity
⑤ importance of distributing vaccines in poor areas

26. Korowai 부족에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Deep within the jungle of the southeast Indonesian province of 
Papua lives the Korowai tribe. Until their discovery by a Dutch 
man in 1974, the Korowai had hardly any contact with the 
outside world. The Korowai are still self-sufficient, producing 
almost everything themselves. Korowai families have their own 
gardens nearby, in which they cultivate sweet potatoes and 
vegetables. They live off whatever nature provides in their 
immediate surroundings. They raise pigs as a means of 
exchange and dogs for hunting. The Korowai people live in 
houses high up in the trees. The houses protect families not 
only against a mass of mosquitoes below but also against 
annoying neighbors and evil spirits.

것은? [3점] 
When people share the same daily, weekly, monthly, and 
seasonal rhythms, connections among them form faster and 
stay stronger. The people trust each other more deeply, and 
① coordination becomes easier. After all, they are ② frequently 
doing the same things and working on the same problems 
together. In fact, several organizations use regular stand-up 
meetings to maintain strong bonds and reinforce a ③ shared 
mindset. A CEO of a food company talks about his short daily 
meeting with his team. He explains, “The rhythm that frequency 
generates allows relationships to ④ weaken, personal habits 
to be understood, and stressors to be identified. All of this 
⑤ helps the members of the team understand not only their 
roles but also how they can get the best out of one another.”

When Paul Dver was a high school student, he met comedian 
Soupy Sales and became friends with him. ① He even 
occasionally talked to the comedian on the telephone. Paul 
would tell his fellow high school students that ② he was friends 
with Soupy Sales, and of course they didn’t believe him. One 
day, ③ he asked Soupy for a favor. Paul and his friends were 
appearing in a play, and ④ he asked Soupy to record an 
advertisement for him because if it were recorded in Soupy’s 
voice, the local radio station would play it. Soupy did more than 
just record the advertisement as written. ⑤ He threw in some 
ad-libs and made it funny. Of course, Paul’s high school friends 
were amazed to hear Soupy’s voice on the radio advertising 
Paul and his friends’ play.

30. In the not-too-distant future, everyday objects such as 
shoes, carpets, and toothbrushes will contain technology that 
collects information. You will then be able to personalize these 
objects, allowing them to change physical state like color or 
respond to your daily mood. They will also be able to exchange 
data with other objects and send information to other people. 
For example, your toothbrush will be capable of analyzing your 
breath and booking an appointment with your doctor if it detects 
the smell of lung cancer. In other words, what were once just 
ordinary objects will be increasingly              . 
Manufacturers will use the information generated by these 
smart products to sell you other services or enhance your 
“ownership experience.” [3점]  
① changeable and dangerous

③ networked and intelligent
④ insecure and meaningless
⑤ complicated and isolated
31. When you ask people to rank the days of the week in order 
of preference, Friday is ranked higher than Sunday, although 
Friday is a workday and Sunday is not. Would people rather 
work than play? Not quite. Then, why do people prefer Friday 
to Sunday? The reason is that Friday brings promise ― the 
promise of the weekend ahead and all the activities we have 
planned. Sunday, while a day of rest, does not bring with it the 
joy of anticipation. To the contrary, although we may be having 
a picnic in the park or walking around town, these delightful 
activities are damaged by the anticipation of the full workweek 
ahead. Whether good or bad, our emotional state is determined 
both by feelings that are triggered by the world at present and 
those generated by . [3점] 
① our expectations of the future
② the sensitivity to others’ opinions
③ the belief in our ability to succeed
④ our preference for social activities
⑤ interactions with other human beings
32. One of the reasons I’ve collected a large library of books 
over the years is because books are a great go-to resource. 
Other than having a conversation with someone who has 
accomplished what you hope to achieve, in my experience 
books and published works offer the most in terms of 
documented research and role models for success. The Internet 
has quickly become an invaluable tool as well. Whether offline 
or online, you’re trying to find people who have already gone 
down the road you’re traveling, so you can research, model, 
and benchmark their experience. A college professor once told 
me, “Gary, you’re smart, but people have lived before you. 
You’re not the first person to dream big, so you’d be wise to 
, and then build 
your actions on the back of their lessons.” [3점]
① study what others have learned first
② attempt what others think impossible
③ find where your social networking starts
④ judge who would be given an opportunity
⑤ understand why people have small dreams

The old saying “Use it or lose it” is never more appropriate 
than when referring to flexibility. Children are generally very 
flexible, as noted when an infant chews on his toe or puts his 
foot behind his head. This flexibility, (A) , is usually 
short-lived unless the child remains active and engages in 
flexibility-related activities such as gymnastics or wrestling. 
As adults, we can lose flexibility rather rapidly unless we make 
a conscious effort to maintain it. (B) , flexibility 
does not have to disappear with age, but it often does because 
of a simple lack of exercise.

34. 다음 글에 드러난 Charlie의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Charlie knew something was wrong. The lake was gone. He 
paused and scanned the field, but he could not see anything 
familiar. Suddenly a dog barked behind him. The sound, 
unexpected and loud, startled him, so he began to run away. 
Then another dog was barking, and another, and he had no idea 
where the dogs were. He was terribly frightened and he ran 
with increasing awkwardness, tearing at the weeds with his 
hands, pulling at the air, so that everything about him seemed 
to be running except his slow feet. The sound of the dogs 
seemed to be all around him, even getting louder.
① shocked and fearful ② bored and lonely
③ relieved and satisfied ④ touched and grateful
⑤ ashamed and regretful
[35 ~ 36] 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장을 고르시오.
35. Hiding behind a barrier is a normal response we learn at an 
early age to protect ourselves. ① As children, we hid behind 
solid objects such as furniture or our mother’s skirt whenever we 
found ourselves in a threatening situation. ② As we grew older, 
this hiding behavior became more sophisticated. ③ Adults were 
found to use a wide variety of strategies to protect their 
children. ④ As adults, we fold one or both arms across the 
chest in an unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive 
as a threat or undesirable circumstances. ⑤ Women’s use of 
arm barriers is less noticeable than men’s because women can 
grasp on to things like handbags or purses.
36. Globalization has resulted in a global brain drain, which refers 
to the situation in which countries lose their best educated 
workers. ① A report released by the Arab League in 2009 
found that roughly 100,000 scientists, doctors, and engineers 
were leaving countries in the Middle East and North Africa every 
year, with most of the scientists and doctors never returning. 
② Another study suggested that vast numbers of developing 
countries’ doctors were working abroad, including 41% from 
Jamaica and 30% from Ghana. ③ Many doctors have searched 
for the causes of a rare brain disease. ④ The brain drain has 
even worried some wealthy countries. ⑤ The government of 
New Zealand, for instance, launched a program in 2006 to try 
to attract its professionals living abroad back home.

Imagine that a study on the effects of drinking coffee 
comes out in the news. The study suggests that drinking at 
least three cups a day significantly improves attention and 
memory.
(A) Then she reads a newer study that says drinking more 
than two cups of coffee a day is linked to significantly 
decreased attention and heightened anxiety. 
(B) A woman reads this study and immediately increases her 
morning coffee ritual to three cups. For the next month 
she thinks she is more attentive and remembering things 
better because she’s drinking more coffee. 
(C) The second study has been promoted as actively as the 
first, and is equally convincing. She thinks, “I have been 
feeling more anxious lately, and maybe I’m not as focused 
as I thought,” and she decreases her coffee intake down to 
two cups.

We frequently overestimate agreement with others, believing 
that everyone else thinks and feels exactly like we do. This 
misconception is called the false-consensus effect. 
(A) They also had to estimate how many other students would 
do the task. Those who were willing to wear the sign 
assumed that the majority would also agree to it. 
(B) On the other hand, those who refused believed that most 
people would find it too stupid to do. In both cases, the 
students imagined themselves to be in the majority. 
(C) Psychologist Lee Ross began studying this in 1977. He

To prove this wrong, Newton reversed the process.
In the late 1600s, Sir Issac Newton conducted a series of 
experiments involving prisms, light, and color, which form the 
basis of our current understanding of color. ( ① ) These 
experiments involved refracting white light through a prism ― a 
simple triangular glass object that separates light waves into 
individual colors. ( ② ) The results revealed that light could 
actually be broken down into seven individual colors: red, 
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. ( ③ ) Until this 
discovery, it was assumed that a prism somehow “colored” the 
light passing through it. ( ④ ) He projected the colors back 
into the prism, which resulted in pure white light. ( ⑤ ) 
Artists and scientists alike were amazed by this discovery that 
light is the source of all color.

In a study, 211 women signed up for a sixteen-week 
weight-loss program. All participants were randomly 
separated into three groups: long-term public commitment, 
short-term public commitment, and no public commitment. 
Those in the long-term group wrote their names and 
weight-loss goals on index cards that were publicly 
displayed in the fitness center for the full sixteen weeks of 
the program. Those in the short-term group did the same, 
but the cards were displayed for only the first three weeks. 
Those in the no-public-commitment group did not fill out 
cards. At the conclusion of the study, the effect of 
long-term public commitment was evident. At the 
sixteen-week mark, the long-term group had, on average, 
exceeded their goals by about 102%, while the short-term 
group achieved an average of 96% success and the 
no-commitment group reached only 88%.

Daylight Saving Time is a way of making better use of the 
daylight in the evenings by setting the clocks forward one 
hour during the longer days of spring and summer, and back 
again in the fall. Recently, researchers have shown that 
changing a person’s body clock twice a year has its own 
significant      , especially when they lose an 
hour of sleep in the spring. The day after Daylight Saving 
Time begins, thousands of drivers suffer from a regional 
case of jet lag, and accident rates rise by 7% on that day. 
Even more damaging, one anti-daylight-saving researcher 
has claimed that students in daylight saving regions spend 
seven months of the year out of step with their natural 
biorhythms. Consequently, when the researcher compared 
the SAT scores of students in Indiana counties that observed 
Daylight Saving Time, he found that they scored sixteen 
fewer points than their fellow students in counties that 
chose to observe standard time all year long. Education 
policymakers devote millions of dollars each year to closing 
small SAT performance gaps that unfairly disadvantage one 
group of students relative to another. These results suggest 
that eliminating Daylight Saving Time might offer one 
relatively inexpensive solution.

[43 ~ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
Many people make the decision to become a teacher after 
having a deep personal experience with a teacher. I once 
asked an elementary school teacher, Sera, why she chose a　
career in that field, and she told me that (a) she had a 
learning disability when she was growing up and did　not have 
a very easy time in school. She went on to tell me how many 
classmates had called her stupid and made fun of her, and how she had felt when she couldn’t find any help. 
(B)
Once she was diagnosed as dyslexic and began using some 
alternative ways to learn, (b) she actually started liking 
school and doing better. That teacher made a huge difference 
in that　girl’s life. Sera decided that even if it was hard, she 
was going to find a way to help other children. From that 
moment on (c) she was determined to work hard and find a 
way to become a teacher. * dyslexic: 난독증이 있는
(C)
When Sera was in sixth grade, however, she met a teacher 
who changed her life. During a class, the teacher asked the 
girl to　answer a question about a story she had just asked 
the students to read. The girl didn’t know the answer and　
the teacher realized something was wrong. (d) She asked the girl to stay after class.
(D)
When they were　 alone, Sera said, “I’m stupid. Everyone 
says so. I’m sorry, but this is the best I can do.” The kind　
teacher told her that (e) she was not stupid. She told the girl 
that perhaps she just needed to learn things in a different 
way and she was going to help her. The teacher told the 
problem to the school counselor and made sure the girl was tested. It　turned out she was dyslexic.
