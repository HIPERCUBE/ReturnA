26. Korowai 부족에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Deep within the jungle of the southeast Indonesian province of 
Papua lives the Korowai tribe. Until their discovery by a Dutch 
man in 1974, the Korowai had hardly any contact with the 
outside world. The Korowai are still self-sufficient, producing 
almost everything themselves. Korowai families have their own 
gardens nearby, in which they cultivate sweet potatoes and 
vegetables. They live off whatever nature provides in their 
immediate surroundings. They raise pigs as a means of 
exchange and dogs for hunting. The Korowai people live in 
houses high up in the trees. The houses protect families not 
only against a mass of mosquitoes below but also against 
annoying neighbors and evil spirits.
