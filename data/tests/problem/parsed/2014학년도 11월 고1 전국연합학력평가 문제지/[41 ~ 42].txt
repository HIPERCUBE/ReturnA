Daylight Saving Time is a way of making better use of the 
daylight in the evenings by setting the clocks forward one 
hour during the longer days of spring and summer, and back 
again in the fall. Recently, researchers have shown that 
changing a person’s body clock twice a year has its own 
significant      , especially when they lose an 
hour of sleep in the spring. The day after Daylight Saving 
Time begins, thousands of drivers suffer from a regional 
case of jet lag, and accident rates rise by 7% on that day. 
Even more damaging, one anti-daylight-saving researcher 
has claimed that students in daylight saving regions spend 
seven months of the year out of step with their natural 
biorhythms. Consequently, when the researcher compared 
the SAT scores of students in Indiana counties that observed 
Daylight Saving Time, he found that they scored sixteen 
fewer points than their fellow students in counties that 
chose to observe standard time all year long. Education 
policymakers devote millions of dollars each year to closing 
small SAT performance gaps that unfairly disadvantage one 
group of students relative to another. These results suggest 
that eliminating Daylight Saving Time might offer one 
relatively inexpensive solution.
