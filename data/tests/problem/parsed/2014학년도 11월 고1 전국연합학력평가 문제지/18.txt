Dear readers,
Thank you for your subscription to The Kitchens! 
Please take a moment to read this message. We want to 
ask you to recycle this magazine for pick-up once 
you’ve finished tearing out all the ideas in it for your 
“dream kitchen” file. Today, only about 20 percent of 
magazines are recycled from the home, and we want to 
change that. By increasing magazine recycling, we can 
reduce the amount of new fiber that must be obtained 
from wood, meaning that fewer trees will have to be cut 
down. Recycle today and always.
