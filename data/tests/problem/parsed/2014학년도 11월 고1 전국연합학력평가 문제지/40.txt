In a study, 211 women signed up for a sixteen-week 
weight-loss program. All participants were randomly 
separated into three groups: long-term public commitment, 
short-term public commitment, and no public commitment. 
Those in the long-term group wrote their names and 
weight-loss goals on index cards that were publicly 
displayed in the fitness center for the full sixteen weeks of 
the program. Those in the short-term group did the same, 
but the cards were displayed for only the first three weeks. 
Those in the no-public-commitment group did not fill out 
cards. At the conclusion of the study, the effect of 
long-term public commitment was evident. At the 
sixteen-week mark, the long-term group had, on average, 
exceeded their goals by about 102%, while the short-term 
group achieved an average of 96% success and the 
no-commitment group reached only 88%.
