Across the developing world today, the “mobile health” 
revolution ― mobile phones used as tools for healthcare ― is 
responsible for a number of improvements. Mobile phones are 
now used to connect patients to doctors, to monitor drug 
distribution, and to share basic health information that isn’t 
available locally. Mobile phones are tools to send reminders 
about medication and appointments to patients. The central 
problems of health sectors in poor places ― clinics without 
enough staff, patients in remote places, too few medications or 
inefficient distribution of them, and misinformation about 
vaccines and disease prevention ― will all find at least partial 
solutions through connectivity.
