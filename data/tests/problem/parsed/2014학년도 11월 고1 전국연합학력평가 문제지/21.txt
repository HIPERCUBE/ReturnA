Several studies have found that pet owners have lower blood 
pressure, a reduced risk of heart disease, and lower levels of 
stress. Pets can also be a plus in the workplace. A study found 
that in the course of workday, stress levels decreased for 
workers who brought in their dogs. The differences in 
perceived stress between days the dog was present and absent 
were significant. The employees as a whole had a higher job 
satisfaction than industry norms. Having a dog in the office had 
a positive effect on the general atmosphere, relieving stress 
and making everyone around happier. Pet presence may serve 
as a low-cost wellness solution readily available to many 
organizations.
