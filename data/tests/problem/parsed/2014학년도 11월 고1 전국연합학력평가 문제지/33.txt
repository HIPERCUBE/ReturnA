The old saying “Use it or lose it” is never more appropriate 
than when referring to flexibility. Children are generally very 
flexible, as noted when an infant chews on his toe or puts his 
foot behind his head. This flexibility, (A) , is usually 
short-lived unless the child remains active and engages in 
flexibility-related activities such as gymnastics or wrestling. 
As adults, we can lose flexibility rather rapidly unless we make 
a conscious effort to maintain it. (B) , flexibility 
does not have to disappear with age, but it often does because
