Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, 
had a great sense of delicacy ① where other persons’ feelings 
were concerned. He once paid a visit to George Meredith, 
the novelist, when Meredith was old and weak. Meredith 
suffered from an unusual disease that caused him ② to fall 
occasionally. The two men were walking up a path toward 
Meredith’s summerhouse, Conan Doyle in the lead, when 
Conan Doyle heard the old novelist fall behind him. He 
judged by the sound ③ which the fall was a mere slip and 
could not have hurt Meredith. Therefore, he did not turn and 
he strode on as if he ④ had heard nothing. “He was a 
fiercely proud old man,” Conan Doyle later explained, “and 
my instincts told me that his humiliation in being helped up 
would be ⑤ far greater than any relief I could give him.”
