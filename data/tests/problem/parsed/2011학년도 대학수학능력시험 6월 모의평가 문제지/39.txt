39. One of the common mistakes that employers make is 
looking at a team of employees as a homogeneous group that 
rises and falls together. Offering incentives, such as a group 
bonus or a vacation trip, to a team as a whole is not a smart 
managerial move because it fails to acknowledge who an 
individual is. For example, sending an entire team to Hawaii 
for a job well done actually discourages an employee’s efforts 
to do his best work. He only needs to perform well enough 
to help achieve the team objective. If, on the other hand, the 
employee knew that individual rewards were possible, he 
would be more likely to strive to outperform expectations. 
While teamwork is important within a corporation, management 
should come up with new compensation packages to help 
individuals to become champions.
