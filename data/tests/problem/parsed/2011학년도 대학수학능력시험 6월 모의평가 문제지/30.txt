Every writer is starting from a different point and is 
bound for a different destination. Yet many writers are 
paralyzed by the thought that they are competing with 
everybody else who is trying to write and presumably 
doing it better. This can often happen in a writing class. 
Inexperienced students are chilled to find themselves in the 
same class with students whose articles have appeared in 
the college newspaper. But writing for the college paper is 
no great credit; I have often found that the hares who write 
for the paper are overtaken by the tortoises who move 
studiously toward the goal of mastering the craft. The same 
fear hangs around freelance writers, who see the work of 
other writers appearing in magazines while their own keeps 
returning in the mail. Forget the competition and go at 
your own pace.
