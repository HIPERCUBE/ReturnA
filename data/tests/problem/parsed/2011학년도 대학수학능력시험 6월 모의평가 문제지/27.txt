27. Why don’t we think differently more often? The reason is 
that we do not need to be creative for most of what we do. 
For example, we do not need to be creative when we are 
driving on the freeway, or riding in an elevator, or waiting in 
line at a grocery store. ________________________ when it 
comes to the business of living. For most of our activities, 
these routines are indispensable. Without them, our lives 
would be in chaos, and we would not get much accomplished. 
If you got up this morning and started contemplating the 
shape of your toothbrush or questioning the meaning of toast, 
you probably would not make it to work.
① We are creatures of habit
② Social restrictions do not apply
③ We pay more attention to safety
④ Personal accomplishments do matter
⑤ Creative thinking is highly recommended
