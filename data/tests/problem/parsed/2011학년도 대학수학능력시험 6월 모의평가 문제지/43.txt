Jim performed fieldwork in Lesotho, a small nation 
in Africa. There, studying and interacting with local 
villagers, he patiently earned their trust until one day 
he was asked to join in one of their songs.
(A) The villagers found his response puzzling. They just 
stared at Jim and said, “What do you mean you don’t 
sing? You talk!” Jim recalls later, “It was as odd to 
them as if I told them that I couldn’t walk or dance, 
even though I have both my legs.”
(B) Jim replied in a soft voice, “I don’t sing,” and it was 
true. Although he was an excellent oboe player, he was 
unable to sing a simple melody.
(C) That’s because singing and dancing were a natural 
activity in their lives, involving everyone. Their word 
for singing, ho bina, also means ‘to dance’; there is no 
distinction, since it is assumed that singing involves 
bodily movement.
