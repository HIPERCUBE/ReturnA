34. Our love for another person pulls us out of ourselves 
and lifts our thoughts to a grander scale: How can I make 
the world better for this person? When I was young, the 
only love I experienced was the immature, selfish love of 
“I love her because she makes me feel good.” Now I think 
about the woman I love in terms of what she wants. I want 
to make her happy because I cannot be happy when she is 
unhappy. We discover that the act of giving true love is 
more powerful than getting the hug you need―if we can 
get over our own hunger for love, then we have reached 
the state of pure love, of being connected to a larger ideal, 
bigger than our own individual life.
