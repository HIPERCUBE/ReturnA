Fortunately, one of the most sustained research programs 
in postwar musicology has succeeded in reconstructing their 
original sequence.
Beethoven took scraps of paper with him on his frequent 
walks, writing down his musical ideas as they came to him. 
( ① ) At home, he kept large sketchbooks into which he 
might copy the results or enter new ideas, fashioning and 
refashioning the music, crossing it out and starting again. 
( ② ) After Beethoven’s death these sketchbooks were 
scattered and in many cases broken up. ( ③ ) As a 
result, you can work through them and trace the painful 
process by which Beethoven edged toward the music that 
we know. ( ④ ) For instance, while the first section of 
the ‘Ode to Joy’ seems to have come to him with little 
difficulty, the middle section gave him enormous trouble; 
there is sketch upon sketch in which Beethoven tries one 
idea, then another. ( ⑤ ) And you find that the most 
characteristic and expressive features of the music come 
together only during the final stages of the compositional 
process.
