41. Many theatergoers have been offered lots of good plays 
including West Side Story, The King and I, and Dracula for 
several decades. However, they have hardly ever seen new 
works recently because many producers have avoided making 
a new play. Part of the reason may be the tremendous cost 
of making a new production these days. It is true that many 
producers asked to invest a few hundred thousand dollars in 
a production have preferred a play of proven merit and past 
success to a new, untried play. That sounds like a reasonable 
excuse but, in fact, this practice can lead to an undesirable 
situation. Unless new plays are given a chance today, there 
will be nothing to revive in the future.
