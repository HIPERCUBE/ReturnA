The best-known female artist of the sixteenth century, 
Sofonisba Anguissola, was born into a noble Italian family. 
Her mother died young, leaving her wealthy husband with five 
talented daughters. Unusual of the time, this liberal father gave 
his daughters a full classical education including painting. It 
was this enlightened attitude that enabled Anguissola to earn 
her own living as a portrait painter in the Spanish court and 
helped her to rise above the restrictions of her class and 
gender. In Three Sisters Playing Chess, Anguissola broke 
with tradition by concentrating on those scenes and models 
available to her, painting her sisters in a domestic setting. 
This gave the portrait an immediacy, which allowed the 
contemporary Italian art historian Vasari to attribute to her the 
development of the conversational portrait, as opposed to the 
formal frontal or profile portrait.
