36. Jaisalmer에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은? 
Known as the Golden City, Jaisalmer, a former caravan 
center on the route to the Khyber Pass, rises from a sea of 
sand, its 30-foot-high walls and medieval sandstone fort 
sheltering palaces that soar into the sapphire sky. With its 
tiny winding lanes and hidden temples, Jaisalmer is straight 
out of The Arabian Nights. So little has the way of life 
altered here that it is easy to imagine yourself back in the 
13th century. It is the only fortress city in India still 
functioning, with one quarter of its population living within 
the walls. It is just far enough off the beaten path to have 
been spared damage from tourists. The city’s wealth 
originally came from the substantial tolls it placed on 
passing merchants.
