25. A brilliant friend of mine once told me, “When you 
suddenly see a problem, something happens that you have the 
answer―before you are able to put it into words. It is all 
done subconsciously. This has happened many times to me.” 
This feeling of knowing ____________________________ is 
common. The French philosopher and mathematician Blaise 
Pascal is famous for saying, “The heart has its reasons 
that reason cannot know.” The great nineteenth-century 
mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss also admitted that 
intuition often led him to ideas he could not immediately 
prove. He said, “I have had my results for a long time; but 
I do not yet know how I am to arrive at them.” Fittingly so, 
sometimes true genius simply cannot be put into words.
① the meaning of the feelings in your heart
② without being able to say how one knows
③ the way others solve the problems they face
④ how to use the right words to persuade others
⑤ someone that you have never met before in your life
