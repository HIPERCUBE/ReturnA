If someone were to say “Life is a cup of coffee,” it is 
unlikely that you would have heard this expression 
before. But its novelty forces you to think about its 
meaning. The vehicle used, a cup of coffee, is a common 
object of everyday life and therefore easily perceivable as 
a source for thinking about that life. The metaphor 
compels you to start thinking of life in terms of the 
kinds of physical, social, and other attributes that are 
associated with a cup of coffee. For this metaphor to 
gain currency, however, it must capture the fancy of 
many other people for a period of time. Then and only 
then will its novelty have become worn out and will it 
become the basis for a new conceptual metaphor: life is 
a drinking substance. After that, expressions such as 
“life is a cup of tea, life is a bottle of beer, life is a glass 
of milk,” will become similarly understandable as 
offering different perspectives on life.

(A)
Sometimes, someone saying you can’t do something is 
good for you. It builds mental toughness and conviction. 
I often tell people, “Anyone with young children will 
tell you, if you ask them not to do something, they’re 
guaranteed to do it.” The following story is an example 
of how my dad used this to (a) his (and ultimately my) 
advantage.
(B)
I was so annoyed and upset by (b) his response that I 
worked tirelessly for the remainder of the school year. In 
those critical few months I worked so hard that I ended 
up winning three awards at the end of year prize-giving. 
The best part was being able to tell my dad that I’d 
been awarded a place at college. On hearing this news, 
he simply lowered his newspaper and, with a smile, said, 
“Well done, I always knew you would.” At that moment, 
I realized what (c) he had done by ‘discouraging’ me.
(C)
This was my first experience of ‘reverse psychology.’ 
Some people might say it’s a risky strategy, but it has 
certainly worked for me. It has been extremely valuable in 
my life, giving me the confidence, determination and 
motivation to succeed, even when the odds are stacked 
against me. Now as a father myself, I sometimes use the 
same technique to motivate my own son. Often enough, 
he ends up with favorable results. I just hope one day 
(d) he also realizes that I had his best interests in mind.
(D)
As a child I wasn’t particularly academic or ambitious, 
and certainly didn’t work very hard at my studies. It 
wasn’t until I was coming to the end of the eleventh 
grade―and facing the prospect of leaving school without 
any sense of what I wanted to do as a career―that I 
decided to apply to the local college to pursue further 
study. Feeling pleased with myself for having made this 
monumental decision, I proudly announced my plan to 
my dad. (e) His immediate reaction was to say, “You’ll 
never do that. They’ll never accept you.”

Serafina Vinon, a seventy-six-year-old woman from the 
Italian Alps, still gets up at five in the morning to milk her 
cows. Afterward she cooks a huge breakfast, cleans the 
house, and depending on the weather and time of year, 
either takes the herd to the meadow, tends the orchard, or 
cards some wool. In summer she spends weeks on the high 
pastures cutting hay and then carries huge piles of it on her 
head the several miles down to the barn. She could reach 
the barn in half the time if she took a direct route, but she 
prefers following invisible winding trails to save the slopes 
from erosion.
When Serafina was asked what she enjoys doing most in 
life, she had no trouble answering: milking the cows, taking 
them to the pasture, tending the orchard, carding wool. In 
effect what she enjoys most is what she has been doing for 
a living all along. In her own words, “It gives me a great 
satisfaction to be outdoors, to talk with people, and to be 
with my animals. I talk to everybody―plants, birds, flowers, 
and animals. Everything in nature keeps you company; you 
see nature progress every day.”
When she was asked what she would do if she had all 
the time and money in the world, Serafina laughed―and 
repeated the same list of activities. It is not that Serafina is 
ignorant of the alternatives offered by urban life. She 
watches television occasionally and reads newsmagazines. 
But their more fashionable and modern way of life does 
not attract Serafina; she is ________________ the role she 
plays in the universe.
