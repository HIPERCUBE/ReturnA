If someone were to say “Life is a cup of coffee,” it is 
unlikely that you would have heard this expression 
before. But its novelty forces you to think about its 
meaning. The vehicle used, a cup of coffee, is a common 
object of everyday life and therefore easily perceivable as 
a source for thinking about that life. The metaphor 
compels you to start thinking of life in terms of the 
kinds of physical, social, and other attributes that are 
associated with a cup of coffee. For this metaphor to 
gain currency, however, it must capture the fancy of 
many other people for a period of time. Then and only 
then will its novelty have become worn out and will it 
become the basis for a new conceptual metaphor: life is 
a drinking substance. After that, expressions such as 
“life is a cup of tea, life is a bottle of beer, life is a glass 
of milk,” will become similarly understandable as 
offering different perspectives on life.
