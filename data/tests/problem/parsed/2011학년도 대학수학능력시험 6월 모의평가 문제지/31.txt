The traditional American view was that fences were out 
of place in the American landscape. This notion turned up 
① repeatedly in nineteenth-century American writing about 
the landscape. One author after another severely ② criticized 
“the Englishman’s insultingly inhospitable brick wall topped 
with broken bottles.” Frank J. Scott, an early landscape 
architect who had a large impact on the look of America’s 
first suburbs, worked tirelessly to ③ rid the landscape of 
fences. Writing in 1870, he held that to narrow our neighbors’ 
views of the free graces of Nature was ④ unselfish and 
undemocratic. To drive through virtually any American suburb 
today, where every lawn steps right up to the street in a 
gesture of ⑤ openness and welcoming, is to see how 
completely such views have triumphed.
