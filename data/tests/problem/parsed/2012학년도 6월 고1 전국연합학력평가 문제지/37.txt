The more outrageous a rumor, the faster it travels. I
remember reading about a rumor that was passed along by
an individual. When he found the rumor to be false, he went
to the person he had offended to ask how he could make up
for telling it. The offended man asked him to take a feather
pillow, get on the highest building in town, scatter the
feathers and pick all of them up. Obviously, that was an
impossible assignment. Many of us are guilty of passing on
information we hear without knowing for sure it is true.
False statements damage people. Consider the feathers
before passing on a rumor.
