Many people like to have a full calendar. How about you?
When you find there is blank space on your calendar, are

unscheduled time because important activities often take
more time than you expected. Unscheduled time ensures that

and achieve your goals. Unscheduled time protects you when
a project takes longer than you expected. Unscheduled time
helps you get the high priorities done and meet the
unanticipated demands of your business.
