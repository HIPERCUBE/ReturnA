Our round­the­world trip is approaching quickly and we’re
getting a bit anxious about the grand adventure. As we
discussed a few weeks back, we would really appreciate you
and Harold keeping an eye on our house while we travel.
The post office will hold the mail, and we’ve canceled the
newspaper, but please look for any package or fliers that
might still be delivered while we are away. You have a key
to the house. I have attached a copy of our complete
itinerary, including an emergency phone number and our
email address. Thanks again. We promise an invitation to our

Greg felt like a failure if he didn’t receive every
single point on every single assignment. A grade of 95
left him ① asking, “How did I fail to achieve 100?” Greg
realized that his drive for perfectionism was putting him
into a state of constant stress. He decided ② to work
on stress management. He came up with the creative
idea of ③ posting notes everywhere with the simple
message, “92 is still an A.” Gradually, these simple
reminder notes allowed Greg to have a different point of
view and ④ realized that he didn’t have to be perfect at
everything. He still could earn an “A” in class, but with
⑤ much less pressure.

Africans hold some of the same beliefs and practices
regarding feet and footwear that are found in other cultures.
① For example, in much of Africa both feet and shoes have
polluting qualities associated with them. ② It is customary in
many parts of Africa to remove one’s shoes before entering a
home. ③ Some traditions in African dress relate to traditions
of handwork in cloth production. ④ In addition, showing the
soles of one’s feet to other people is unacceptable, even
though many people go barefoot. ⑤West Africans believe that
one must leave a pair of shoes at the door to prevent a ghost
from entering the house.
26. 다음 글의 분위기로 가장 적절한 것은?
It had stopped raining; the roads were clean, and the dust
had been washed from the trees. The earth was refreshed.
The frogs were loud in the pond; they were big, and their
throats were swollen with pleasure. The grass was sparkling
with tiny drops of water. Some boys were playing in the
little stream that the rain had made by the roadside; it was
good to see them and their bright eyes. They were having
the time of their lives, and I could see they were very
happy. They laughed with joy as one said something to
them, though they didn’t understand a word.
① sad and gloomy
② merry and lively
③ tense and urgent
④ funny and humorous
⑤ boring and monotonous
27. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
When you cross paths with a stranger or accidentally catch
someone’s gaze, how do you react? You probably look away
in awkwardness or pretend you are looking at something
else. Well, why don’t you give them a big smile instead?
Deepak Chopra, an Indian medical doctor, talks about giving
each person you encounter a small gift. I do this with a
smile. Why not? It does not cost me anything. Plus, it’s a
lot more fun than feeling awkward and pretending I am not
there. When I smile at people who are not expecting it,
some blush, and others are surprised and smile back. And it
makes me feel all warm inside.
① 어려움에 처한 사람을 외면하지 마라.
② 작은 선물에도 감사하는 마음을 가져라.
③ 낯선 사람과 마주치면 먼저 미소를 지어라.
④ 대화를 할 때는 상대방과 시선을 맞추어라.
⑤ 억지웃음으로 상대방을 불편하게 하지 마라.

28. Jenny Hernandez is the manager of a medium­sized
company that employs about 25 people. Jenny’s leadership
has been contributing to the success of the company. One
characteristic of Jenny’s style is her . She does
not want to give anyone the impression that certain people
have an advantage, and she makes a lot of effort to prevent
this from happening. For example, she avoids social lunches
because she thinks they create the perception of favoritism.
Similarly, even though her best friend is one of the
employees, she is seldom seen talking with her, and if she
is, it is always about business matters.
① fairness
② diligence
③ creativity
④ confidence
⑤ friendliness
29. Dogs seem to be good at . Let’s take
my dogs for an example. They love to sit on the couch, but
if the couch is taken, they’re glad to lie down on the floor.
They also love to go out for a walk. As soon as I open the
front door to look outside, they’re beside me in a flash,
standing expectantly. They fall down by the door in
disappointment when I say, as I leave the house, “No! You
can’t go. You stay here. I’ll be back soon.” However, their
disappointment and discontent evidently passes quite quickly
when the situation develops into a different one. One time
after telling the dogs they had to stay at home, I walked
back through the door almost immediately because I had
forgotten my car keys. The dogs were already happily
playing tug­of­war with a towel they had discovered under
the sofa.
* tug­of­war: 줄다리기
① locating things
② smelling danger
③ enduring hunger
④ recognizing faces
⑤ adapting to change
30. Denis Waitley, an outstanding speaker, explains that the
winning field goal kicker lines up for the field goal and says
to himself, “If I kick this goal, it will put us in the Super
Bowl and will be worth thirty thousand dollars to every
man.” The loser lines up and says, “If I miss this goal, it
will cost all my teammates thirty thousand dollars.” That’s
the difference. According to Dr. Waitley, the winners
concentrate on what they want to get; the losers concentrate
on what they don’t want― and they get it. Undoubtedly, the
most destructive force in our lives is .
As the old saying goes, “Whether you think you can or you
think you can’t, you are right.”
① excessive greed
② the search for the familiar
③ selfishness in all relationships
④ the desire to be only the very best
⑤ the negative use of our imaginations
31. When people say bad things about you, you should
. As an old proverb says, if you engage
yourself in mud­slinging, you will definitely end up making
yourself dirty. Often people try to talk you into responding to
their bad words, and in your attempt to match them word for
word, you fall to their level. Don’t fall into their trap. Just
listen and pity such people. If they are even remotely right
about what they are saying, then try to do a little bit of
reflection over this. Then let your actions speak rather than
allowing yourself to fall down to their level. [3점]
* mud­slinging: 인신 공격, 비방
① ask for others’ opinion
② take legal actions against it
③ give reasonable explanations to them
④ respond to their words in the same way
⑤ avoid responding to what is said about you

and can contribute to a good decision. The decision­maker
predicts what will happen if something is done now, based
on what happened when something was done in the past.
(A) , a decision­maker uses the past to predict the
future. Being knowledgeable and experienced,
decision­makers have collected and stored much information

적절한 것은? [3점]
Most people assume that if they’re going to start on a
six­month expedition, they should take a ton of gear to
prepare for all the possible challenges. However, the
(A) absence / experience of professional backpackers
who have explored every corner of the world teaches
us the exact opposite: the longer the backpacking trip,
the (B) less / more you should carry. It’s better to carry a

Many people like to have a full calendar. How about you?
When you find there is blank space on your calendar, are
you uneasy about it? Get comfortable about having blocks of
unscheduled time because important activities often take
more time than you expected. Unscheduled time ensures that
when something important comes along, you can still fit it in
and achieve your goals. Unscheduled time protects you when
a project takes longer than you expected. Unscheduled time
helps you get the high priorities done and meet the
unanticipated demands of your business.
① the efficiency of a tight schedule
② the necessity of having unscheduled time
③ the importance of finishing work in time
④ difficulties in time management
⑤ efforts to reduce unscheduled time

36. Cantor’s giant softshell turtle에 관한 다음 글의 내용과
일치하지 않는 것은?
Have you ever seen the Cantor’s giant softshell turtle?
The turtle has a broad head, small eyes, and a long nose.
The shell on the back is smooth and olive colored. Cantor’s
giant softshell turtles can grow up to 6 feet in length. The
turtle spends 95 percent of its life buried and motionless
under the sand in the water, and rises to the surface only
twice a day to take a breath. It lays 20 to 28 eggs in
February or March on riverbanks. The turtle is found
primarily in inland, slow­moving fresh water rivers and
streams. The turtle was once distributed across China, India,
Thailand, Malaysia, etc., but it is now regarded as
endangered, and has disappeared from much of its range.

The more outrageous a rumor, the faster it travels. I
remember reading about a rumor that was passed along by
an individual. When he found the rumor to be false, he went
to the person he had offended to ask how he could make up
for telling it. The offended man asked him to take a feather
pillow, get on the highest building in town, scatter the
feathers and pick all of them up. Obviously, that was an
impossible assignment. Many of us are guilty of passing on
information we hear without knowing for sure it is true.
False statements damage people. Consider the feathers
before passing on a rumor.
① 근거 없는 소문을 퍼뜨리지 말아야 한다.
② 제보자의 신상 정보를 보호해 주어야 한다.

⑤ 자신에게 손해가 되더라도 약속을 지켜야 한다.
38. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
I’m told there is a tree in Indonesia called the “upas.”
This tree is poisonous and grows so full and thick that it
kills all plants growing beneath it. I’m sorry to say that I
know some people like that. They are self­centered and try
to keep the attention to themselves. Like the upas tree,
they provide no chance for anyone around them to grow. On
the other hand, I remember trying to balance while walking
on a railroad track. I couldn’t walk too far without losing my
balance. But when my buddy got on the other side, we could
hold each other’s hands and serve as balances for each
other. You and I have a choice to make. We can choose to
be like the upas tree or we can stretch out our hands to
help others.
① Live a Slow Life in the Changing World
② Destroy Others or Go Together with Them?
③ What Is the Best Environment for the Upas Tree?
④ Communication Is Needed in Our Society
⑤ Try to Be the Upas Tree to Others

곳은?
You should refill it because you were the one who
emptied the paper in the machine.
Accepting a job means that you accept the responsibility
that goes with it. ( ① ) Your job description may not list
chores, but you will be expected to do them from time to
time. ( ② ) You should always leave things as you found
them and always do anything that needs to be done. ( ③ )
For example, if you use the last paper in the tray of a
copy machine, what should you do? ( ④ ) This way you
can make it easier for the next person to use the machine.
( ⑤ ) Having paper in the tray made your work easier, so
why not refill it for someone else?

People have a tendency to adopt the attitudes of those
they spend time with― to pick up on their mind­sets,
beliefs, and approaches to challenges. When someone on
a team is rewarded by his good deeds, others are likely
to display similar characteristics. When a leader keeps
her hope in the face of discouraging circumstances,
others admire that quality and want to be like her. When
a team member displays a strong work ethic and begins
to have a positive impact, others imitate him. Attitude is
catching: People become inspired by the good examples
of their peers.
A positive attitude is likely to (A) when it is

[41~42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
If you are like millions of people, you’re probably
receiving Christmas cards from people you know. Do you
find yourself smiling at dozens of Christmas cards?
Probably not. People receive so many Christmas cards
during a season when they have too little time to read
and appreciate them. They hear from dozens of people,
which makes it far less likely that they will take a
moment to remember you and your message. (A) ,
you are sending out so many cards, during a season
when you are busy, that you will be tempted to simply
write, “Thanks and best wishes.” Imagine what that
conveys. “Jane is so rushed that she said the same thing
to me she said to everyone. I’m no big thing to her.” Is
this why you send a Christmas card? Absolutely not.
People want to be treated as important. Unless you
can write dozens of thoughtful and personal notes, don’t
write them at all. (B) , find special occasions
throughout the year to write not to twenty people, but
just one at a time. Choose a time uniquely appropriate to
the person. Birthdays are good, but a card that shows
you know more about him works much better. Try the
date of his first child’s birth, for example. The most
vivid way to show people that they matter is to take
time. You do want them to notice. So, don’t send
expected messages at the expected times. Send highly
personal ones at times that are important to that person
alone.

mother. She wanted him to learn how to play the piano.
She sent her son to a piano teacher. However, there was

a standing ovation.

After the concert, the teacher asked Robby how he

was sick with cancer. She passed away and I wanted her

was able to hear me play. She was deaf when she was

have to play my best for her!”
(D)
One day Robby stopped attending the piano lessons.
