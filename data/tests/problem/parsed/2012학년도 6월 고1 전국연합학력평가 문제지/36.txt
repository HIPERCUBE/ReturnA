Have you ever seen the Cantor’s giant softshell turtle?
The turtle has a broad head, small eyes, and a long nose.
The shell on the back is smooth and olive colored. Cantor’s
giant softshell turtles can grow up to 6 feet in length. The
turtle spends 95 percent of its life buried and motionless
under the sand in the water, and rises to the surface only
twice a day to take a breath. It lays 20 to 28 eggs in
February or March on riverbanks. The turtle is found
primarily in inland, slow­moving fresh water rivers and
streams. The turtle was once distributed across China, India,
Thailand, Malaysia, etc., but it is now regarded as
endangered, and has disappeared from much of its range.
