I’m told there is a tree in Indonesia called the “upas.”
This tree is poisonous and grows so full and thick that it
kills all plants growing beneath it. I’m sorry to say that I
know some people like that. They are self­centered and try
to keep the attention to themselves. Like the upas tree,
they provide no chance for anyone around them to grow. On
the other hand, I remember trying to balance while walking
on a railroad track. I couldn’t walk too far without losing my
balance. But when my buddy got on the other side, we could
hold each other’s hands and serve as balances for each
other. You and I have a choice to make. We can choose to
be like the upas tree or we can stretch out our hands to
help others.
