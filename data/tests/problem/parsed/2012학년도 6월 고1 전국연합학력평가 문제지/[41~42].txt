If you are like millions of people, you’re probably
receiving Christmas cards from people you know. Do you
find yourself smiling at dozens of Christmas cards?
Probably not. People receive so many Christmas cards
during a season when they have too little time to read
and appreciate them. They hear from dozens of people,
which makes it far less likely that they will take a
moment to remember you and your message. (A) ,
you are sending out so many cards, during a season
when you are busy, that you will be tempted to simply
write, “Thanks and best wishes.” Imagine what that
conveys. “Jane is so rushed that she said the same thing
to me she said to everyone. I’m no big thing to her.” Is
this why you send a Christmas card? Absolutely not.
People want to be treated as important. Unless you
can write dozens of thoughtful and personal notes, don’t
write them at all. (B) , find special occasions
throughout the year to write not to twenty people, but
just one at a time. Choose a time uniquely appropriate to
the person. Birthdays are good, but a card that shows
you know more about him works much better. Try the
date of his first child’s birth, for example. The most
vivid way to show people that they matter is to take
time. You do want them to notice. So, don’t send
expected messages at the expected times. Send highly
personal ones at times that are important to that person
alone.
