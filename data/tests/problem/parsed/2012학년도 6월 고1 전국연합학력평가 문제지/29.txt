29. Dogs seem to be good at . Let’s take
my dogs for an example. They love to sit on the couch, but
if the couch is taken, they’re glad to lie down on the floor.
They also love to go out for a walk. As soon as I open the
front door to look outside, they’re beside me in a flash,
standing expectantly. They fall down by the door in
disappointment when I say, as I leave the house, “No! You
can’t go. You stay here. I’ll be back soon.” However, their
disappointment and discontent evidently passes quite quickly
when the situation develops into a different one. One time
after telling the dogs they had to stay at home, I walked
back through the door almost immediately because I had
forgotten my car keys. The dogs were already happily
playing tug­of­war with a towel they had discovered under
the sofa.
