Africans hold some of the same beliefs and practices
regarding feet and footwear that are found in other cultures.
① For example, in much of Africa both feet and shoes have
polluting qualities associated with them. ② It is customary in
many parts of Africa to remove one’s shoes before entering a
home. ③ Some traditions in African dress relate to traditions
of handwork in cloth production. ④ In addition, showing the
soles of one’s feet to other people is unacceptable, even
though many people go barefoot. ⑤West Africans believe that
one must leave a pair of shoes at the door to prevent a ghost
from entering the house.
