28. Jenny Hernandez is the manager of a medium­sized
company that employs about 25 people. Jenny’s leadership
has been contributing to the success of the company. One
characteristic of Jenny’s style is her . She does
not want to give anyone the impression that certain people
have an advantage, and she makes a lot of effort to prevent
this from happening. For example, she avoids social lunches
because she thinks they create the perception of favoritism.
Similarly, even though her best friend is one of the
employees, she is seldom seen talking with her, and if she
is, it is always about business matters.
