24. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Greg felt like a failure if he didn’t receive every
single point on every single assignment. A grade of 95
left him ① asking, “How did I fail to achieve 100?” Greg
realized that his drive for perfectionism was putting him
into a state of constant stress. He decided ② to work
on stress management. He came up with the creative
idea of ③ posting notes everywhere with the simple
message, “92 is still an A.” Gradually, these simple
reminder notes allowed Greg to have a different point of
view and ④ realized that he didn’t have to be perfect at
everything. He still could earn an “A” in class, but with
⑤ much less pressure.
