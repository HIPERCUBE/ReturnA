Our round­the­world trip is approaching quickly and we’re
getting a bit anxious about the grand adventure. As we
discussed a few weeks back, we would really appreciate you
and Harold keeping an eye on our house while we travel.
The post office will hold the mail, and we’ve canceled the
newspaper, but please look for any package or fliers that
might still be delivered while we are away. You have a key
to the house. I have attached a copy of our complete
itinerary, including an emergency phone number and our
email address. Thanks again. We promise an invitation to our
house when we return.
