The graph above shows the results of the survey
designed to see what should be put on the school cafeteria
menu. ① First of all, brown rice got the most yes votes,
whereas carrot soup got the most no votes. ② Fish burger
got exactly twice as many yes votes as no votes. ③ In the
case of vegetarian pizza, the number of no votes was three
times larger than that of yes votes. ④ Out of the four food
options, brown rice got the largest gap between the
numbers of yes and no votes. ⑤ Although twenty students
voted for carrot soup, exactly the same number of students
voted against it.
