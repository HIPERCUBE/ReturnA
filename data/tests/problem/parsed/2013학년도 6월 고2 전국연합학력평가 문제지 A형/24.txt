Dear Mr. Perkins,
It has been over six months since we had the
opportunity to service your car. We certainly hope
that we haven’t done anything to offend you. Starting
June 1st, we’ll be offering our regular customers
periodic inspection of vehicles for free. Thus, we’re
inviting you to bring your car into our shop for a
free check­up. The service will last till June 30th,
from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Feel free to visit our shop at your convenience. An
appointment is not necessary.
Sincerely,
Charlie Hamilton
