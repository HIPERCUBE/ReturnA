My parents had gone shopping. As I stood alone in
Mom and Dad’s bedroom and my grandmother was
napping in another part of the house, I noticed a box of
matches on my Dad’s bedside table. As I picked up the
box, I could hear in my mind my father’s voice saying
as he had many times, “Don’t play with matches!” Behind
the table were lovely white curtains. I wondered what
would happen if I struck a match and touched the curtain
quickly. When I did it, a small hole appeared in the
curtain. I was horrified and quickly hid the curtain
behind the table. “Maybe they would never see it,” I
thought.
That night as I got in bed and pulled the covers over
me, my stomach began to hurt. It got worse, and I wept.
My father came to me and asked, “Son, what is the
matter?” I said, “I have a bad stomachache.” My father
sat quietly by my side, and said, “Where does it hurt?”
He put his hand on my chest and asked, “Does it feel
like a burned curtain?” Then he said in a low voice,
“Son, I think you have learned your lesson. I love you.
Now get some sleep.” At the moment, I realized that my
father knew everything I had done, but he forgave me.
My stomachache had stopped, and my was
gone. I never forgot my father’s quiet words. His love
and forgiveness cured my pain.
