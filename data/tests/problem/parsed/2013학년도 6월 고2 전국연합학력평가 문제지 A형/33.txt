33. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Not long after starting a new college life in a strange city,
I slipped on the stairs and broke my right leg. I was really
amazed, however, by the kindness shown by my new
roommate. When she found me lying in my room with a
swollen leg, unable to move, she took me to the student
health center by cab. After that, she didn’t stop helping me
― she made me amazing meals and made me comfortable
despite my insistence that I could do things on my own. I
was seriously touched by the kindness of everyone― the
girl in the elevator, people on the bus, the doctors and
nurses. So many blessings I never expected came my way.
