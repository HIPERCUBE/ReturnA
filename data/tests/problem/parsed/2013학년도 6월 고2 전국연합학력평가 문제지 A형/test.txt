23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
If children were required to excel only in certain areas,
they might be better able to cope with their parents’
expectations. Psychologist Michael Thompson says that we
make unfair “genetic” demands on our teens: “It is the only
period in your life when you’re expected to do all things
well. Adults don’t hold themselves to those standards. We
don’t interview the dentist about whether he can throw a
basketball, or quiz our accountant on biology before we let
her do our taxes. In elementary and high school we
celebrate the generalist, but in the real world there is no
room for the generalist except on a quiz show.” We should
not expect too much from our children.
① 자녀에게 다양한 경험을 쌓게 해주어야 한다.
② 자녀에게 직업 선택의 중요성을 일깨워주어야 한다.
③ 자녀의 생각이 부모와 다를 수 있음을 인정해야 한다.
④ 자녀가 여러 방면에서 뛰어나기를 기대해서는 안 된다.
⑤ 지나친 조기교육은 자녀의 창의성 계발에 바람직하지 않다.
24. 다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?

25. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
“Why” questions can get you reasons, explanations and
excuses. But they usually don’t come up with useful and
helpful information. Don’t ask your kid why he is having
trouble with his math. Ask him what he needs to do to
perform better. There’s no need to ask an employee why he
didn’t get a contract you were bidding for. Ask him how he
can change so you’ll be certain to get the next one. Good
communicators aren’t interested in the reason why something
is going wrong. They want to find out how to do it right.
The right questions will lead you in that direction, and
finally solve the problems you are facing.
* bid for: ~에 입찰하다
① 문제의 원인보다는 해결 방법을 묻는 질문이 유용하다.

⑤ 조직의 발전은 문제의 발생 원인을 파악하는 데서 시작된다.
26. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Food producers and restaurant chefs use higher levels of
salt and fat to make their products taste better to the
consumer. This in turn increases the possibility of weight
gain and some diseases. Preparing meals at home can be the
best option. It allows you to control the amount of salt and
oils you use in your recipes. When it comes to feeding your
body and mind, nothing is superior to preparing your food at
home. In addition, including family members in meal
preparation can be an opportunity to give and share love.
When food is prepared with a calm mind and loving
thoughts, it can become a vitamin for both the physical body
and the soul.

32. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지
않은 것은? [3점]
Getting an “F” means only that you failed a test― not that
you failed your life. From now on, imagine that the letter
“F” when used as a grade ① represents the word: feedback.
An “F” is an indication that you didn’t understand the
material well enough. It’s a message that you should do
something ② differently before the next test. If you think of
“F” as feedback, you can change your thinking and behavior
in ways that ③prevent your success. You can choose a new
learning strategy. Getting meaningful feedback on your
performance is a powerful strategy for learning anything.
Tests are not the only ④ source of feedback. Make a habit
of asking for feedback from your teachers, friends, and
anyone else who knows you. Just determine what you want
to ⑤ improve and ask, “How am I doing?”
33. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Not long after starting a new college life in a strange city,
I slipped on the stairs and broke my right leg. I was really
amazed, however, by the kindness shown by my new
roommate. When she found me lying in my room with a
swollen leg, unable to move, she took me to the student
health center by cab. After that, she didn’t stop helping me
― she made me amazing meals and made me comfortable
despite my insistence that I could do things on my own. I
was seriously touched by the kindness of everyone― the
girl in the elevator, people on the bus, the doctors and
nurses. So many blessings I never expected came my way.
① curious ② worried ③ envious
④ depressed ⑤ thankful
[34~ 36] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
34. No one else can experience the way your heart feels
about things. No one can see through the lens you use to
see life quite the same as you do. Accept this .
Honor and praise it, too. Do not be quick to compromise it.
In your desire to fit in or make others happy, you may be
tempted to pretend to be someone you are not. You may
even pretend to believe things you don’t really believe, or
act in ways that are out of character with who you really
are. When you do this, you lose out on the real you. The
world loses out on you, too. Strive to be a healthy, happy
and enlightened person― and then, taking your place
alongside your fellow travelers, offer your self to the
waiting world. [3점]
① similarity ② endurance ③ generosity
④ individuality ⑤ compliment
35. When you get into your new exercise routine,
is of great importance. If you’re sore
while exercising, stop it immediately, as overuse will set
you up for injuries such as muscle aches. If you are in a
group fitness class, don’t always listen to the instructor or
mimic what everyone else is doing. If you don’t feel
comfortable with any part of the class, sit it out. This gives
your muscles enough time to prepare for the stress it’s
about to endure. Then, your body will thank you later by
helping to prevent any possibility of an injury from
occurring.
① proper rest
② good posture
③ a balanced diet
④ physical training
⑤ a continuing effort
36. One response that happens after a diagnosis of memory
loss is the tendency to when things do
not go well. Here is a good example: Jane, a woman in her
mid­sixties, recently got a call from her son, who asked her
to get a bus pass for an upcoming doctor’s visit. A couple
of days later, the son called and asked Jane if she had
gotten the bus pass. She said, with some guilt, “Oh no, I’m
sorry I forgot all about that.” Her son’s response was, “Well,
Mom, I asked you to do that just two days ago.” Jane ended
the conversation feeling upset at herself and telling herself
she “shouldn’t” have forgotten what her son had asked. But
her forgetfulness was not her fault. She could not control
the memory loss. [3점]
① avoid physical activity
② escape from reality
③ suspect others
④ blame yourself
⑤ ask for help

of them die in her saliva or the acid in the stomach.

곳은? [3점]
Their concern is valid, but a study shows there’s a good
news to the graying of our nation.
It is predicted that there will be more people over 60 than
under 15 in 20 years. ( ① ) It will mean an aging society
with an increasing number of old people and fewer
youngsters. ( ② ) In reality, some youngsters worry about
caring for old people while also keeping the country’s
productivity going. ( ③ ) Over the years, the older subjects
proved to have fewer negative emotions and more positive
ones compared with their younger days. ( ④ ) It means as
people age, they’re more emotionally balanced and better
able to solve highly emotional problems. ( ⑤ ) After all,
that may lead to a more stable world as well.
40. 주어진 문장 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것은?
We know that consuming too much salt can cause
diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes.
(A) But most people consume far more than recommended.
Researchers say the average child consumes 2,700mg of
salt a day and the average adult consumes 3,300mg of
salt.
(B) These figures are more than two times the
recommended daily salt intake. That could be a serious
threat to our health. Therefore, we should cut back on
salt significantly.
(C) To prevent such diseases, it’s important to know how
much salt we consume. According to recent studies, the
recommended daily salt intake is 1,200mg for children
and 1,500mg for adults.

[41 ~42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
My parents had gone shopping. As I stood alone in
Mom and Dad’s bedroom and my grandmother was
napping in another part of the house, I noticed a box of
matches on my Dad’s bedside table. As I picked up the
box, I could hear in my mind my father’s voice saying
as he had many times, “Don’t play with matches!” Behind
the table were lovely white curtains. I wondered what
would happen if I struck a match and touched the curtain
quickly. When I did it, a small hole appeared in the
curtain. I was horrified and quickly hid the curtain
behind the table. “Maybe they would never see it,” I
thought.
That night as I got in bed and pulled the covers over
me, my stomach began to hurt. It got worse, and I wept.
My father came to me and asked, “Son, what is the
matter?” I said, “I have a bad stomachache.” My father
sat quietly by my side, and said, “Where does it hurt?”
He put his hand on my chest and asked, “Does it feel
like a burned curtain?” Then he said in a low voice,
“Son, I think you have learned your lesson. I love you.
Now get some sleep.” At the moment, I realized that my
father knew everything I had done, but he forgave me.
My stomachache had stopped, and my was
gone. I never forgot my father’s quiet words. His love
and forgiveness cured my pain.

[43 ~45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
I have always been friendly with the clerks at the
local convenience store where I often visit. I don’t think
people appreciate what a difficult job these people have
sometimes. They work for a little over minimum wage
and I often wonder how they make a living.
(B)
Then she contacted Susie, asking her to come in for
an eye exam free of charge. When Susie questioned
what was going on, the doctor just told (a) her that
someone had donated the money for her new glasses.
Later, when I went in to pay the bill, I found that she
only charged me half the price of the glasses!
(C)
A few days later, when I visited the store, I was
happy to see Susie wearing her new glasses. (b) She
was telling all the regular customers how it came about.
I’m sure that upon hearing the story, ideas of kindness
may have sprouted in the minds of many. She will never
know who the gift was from, but I hope (c) she believes
that there are many warm­hearted people in the world.
* sprout: 싹트다
(D)
One day, I found that one of the clerks, Susie, was
not wearing her glasses. I commented on it and (d) she
said they’d been broken and that she couldn’t afford a
new pair. It was obvious that she was having a difficult
time. I decided to help her. Wondering how I could help,
I asked my eye doctor for assistance with my plan. The
doctor told me that she was so touched by my idea that
(e) she would give Susie an eye exam for free.
