(A)
I have always been friendly with the clerks at the
local convenience store where I often visit. I don’t think
people appreciate what a difficult job these people have
sometimes. They work for a little over minimum wage
and I often wonder how they make a living.
(B)
Then she contacted Susie, asking her to come in for
an eye exam free of charge. When Susie questioned
what was going on, the doctor just told (a) her that
someone had donated the money for her new glasses.
Later, when I went in to pay the bill, I found that she
only charged me half the price of the glasses!
(C)
A few days later, when I visited the store, I was
happy to see Susie wearing her new glasses. (b) She
was telling all the regular customers how it came about.
I’m sure that upon hearing the story, ideas of kindness
may have sprouted in the minds of many. She will never
know who the gift was from, but I hope (c) she believes
that there are many warm­hearted people in the world.
* sprout: 싹트다
(D)
One day, I found that one of the clerks, Susie, was
not wearing her glasses. I commented on it and (d) she
said they’d been broken and that she couldn’t afford a
new pair. It was obvious that she was having a difficult
time. I decided to help her. Wondering how I could help,
I asked my eye doctor for assistance with my plan. The
doctor told me that she was so touched by my idea that
(e) she would give Susie an eye exam for free.
