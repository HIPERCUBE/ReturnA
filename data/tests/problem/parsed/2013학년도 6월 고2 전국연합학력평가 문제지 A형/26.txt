salt and fat to make their products taste better to the
consumer. This in turn increases the possibility of weight
gain and some diseases. Preparing meals at home can be the
best option. It allows you to control the amount of salt and
oils you use in your recipes. When it comes to feeding your
body and mind, nothing is superior to preparing your food at
home. In addition, including family members in meal

thoughts, it can become a vitamin for both the physical body
and the soul.
