36. One response that happens after a diagnosis of memory
loss is the tendency to when things do
not go well. Here is a good example: Jane, a woman in her
mid­sixties, recently got a call from her son, who asked her
to get a bus pass for an upcoming doctor’s visit. A couple
of days later, the son called and asked Jane if she had
gotten the bus pass. She said, with some guilt, “Oh no, I’m
sorry I forgot all about that.” Her son’s response was, “Well,
Mom, I asked you to do that just two days ago.” Jane ended
the conversation feeling upset at herself and telling herself
she “shouldn’t” have forgotten what her son had asked. But
her forgetfulness was not her fault. She could not control
the memory loss. [3점]
