is of great importance. If you’re sore
while exercising, stop it immediately, as overuse will set
you up for injuries such as muscle aches. If you are in a
group fitness class, don’t always listen to the instructor or

your muscles enough time to prepare for the stress it’s
about to endure. Then, your body will thank you later by
helping to prevent any possibility of an injury from
occurring.
