Many businesses send free gifts or samples through the
mail, or allow customers to try and test new products in order
to persuade future customers to (A) purchase / purchasing
them. Charity organizations, too, use the give­and­take
approach by perhaps sending target persons a package of
Christmas cards or calendars. Those who receive the package
(B) feel / feels obligated to send something in return. So
powerful is this sense of obligation to return the favor that it
affects our daily lives very much. (C) Inviting / Invited to a
dinner party, we feel under pressure to invite our hosts to one
of ours. If someone gives us a gift, we need to return it in

32. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지
않은 것은? [3점]
Getting an “F” means only that you failed a test― not that
you failed your life. From now on, imagine that the letter
“F” when used as a grade ① represents the word: feedback.
An “F” is an indication that you didn’t understand the
material well enough. It’s a message that you should do
something ② differently before the next test. If you think of
“F” as feedback, you can change your thinking and behavior
in ways that ③prevent your success. You can choose a new
learning strategy. Getting meaningful feedback on your
performance is a powerful strategy for learning anything.
Tests are not the only ④ source of feedback. Make a habit
of asking for feedback from your teachers, friends, and
anyone else who knows you. Just determine what you want
to ⑤ improve and ask, “How am I doing?”
33. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Not long after starting a new college life in a strange city,
I slipped on the stairs and broke my right leg. I was really
amazed, however, by the kindness shown by my new
roommate. When she found me lying in my room with a
swollen leg, unable to move, she took me to the student
health center by cab. After that, she didn’t stop helping me
― she made me amazing meals and made me comfortable
despite my insistence that I could do things on my own. I
was seriously touched by the kindness of everyone― the
girl in the elevator, people on the bus, the doctors and
nurses. So many blessings I never expected came my way.
① curious ② worried ③ envious
④ depressed ⑤ thankful
34. No one else can experience the way your heart feels
about things. No one can see through the lens you use to
see life quite the same as you do. Accept this .
Honor and praise it, too. Do not be quick to compromise it.
In your desire to fit in or make others happy, you may be
tempted to pretend to be someone you are not. You may
even pretend to believe things you don’t really believe, or
act in ways that are out of character with who you really
are. When you do this, you lose out on the real you. The
world loses out on you, too. Strive to be a healthy, happy
and enlightened person― and then, taking your place
alongside your fellow travelers, offer your self to the
waiting world. [3점]
① similarity ② endurance ③ generosity
④ individuality ⑤ compliment
35. When you get into your new exercise routine,
is of great importance. If you’re sore
while exercising, stop it immediately, as overuse will set
you up for injuries such as muscle aches. If you are in a
group fitness class, don’t always listen to the instructor or
mimic what everyone else is doing. If you don’t feel
comfortable with any part of the class, sit it out. This gives
your muscles enough time to prepare for the stress it’s
about to endure. Then, your body will thank you later by
helping to prevent any possibility of an injury from
occurring.
① proper rest
② good posture
③ a balanced diet
④ physical training
⑤ a continuing effort
36. One response that happens after a diagnosis of memory
loss is the tendency to when things do
not go well. Here is a good example: Jane, a woman in her
mid­sixties, recently got a call from her son, who asked her
to get a bus pass for an upcoming doctor’s visit. A couple
of days later, the son called and asked Jane if she had
gotten the bus pass. She said, with some guilt, “Oh no, I’m
sorry I forgot all about that.” Her son’s response was, “Well,
Mom, I asked you to do that just two days ago.” Jane ended
the conversation feeling upset at herself and telling herself
she “shouldn’t” have forgotten what her son had asked. But
her forgetfulness was not her fault. She could not control
the memory loss. [3점]
① avoid physical activity
② escape from reality

Their concern is valid, but a study shows there’s a good
news to the graying of our nation.
It is predicted that there will be more people over 60 than
under 15 in 20 years. ( ① ) It will mean an aging society
with an increasing number of old people and fewer
youngsters. ( ② ) In reality, some youngsters worry about
caring for old people while also keeping the country’s
productivity going. ( ③ ) Over the years, the older subjects
proved to have fewer negative emotions and more positive
ones compared with their younger days. ( ④ ) It means as
people age, they’re more emotionally balanced and better
able to solve highly emotional problems. ( ⑤ ) After all,
that may lead to a more stable world as well.
