Several months ago, my daughter and I were taking a walk 
with a friend and her son. My daughter was distracted by the 
sound of frogs, so she walked over to see several of them by 
the edge of the water. “Look at the frogs by the pond!” she 
exclaimed excitedly, to which my friend replied, “That’s not 
a pond, that’s a vernal pool.” Perhaps I should be 
embarrassed to admit this, but I had no idea what a vernal 
pool was any more than my daughter did. I realize that as a 
devoted naturalist and environmentalist, she was trying to 
help my child widen her knowledge of the natural world. 
However, what happened was that my young child was 
confused and distracted from the important thing, which was 
admiring the frogs and their beautiful songs. My friend’s 
good intentions of correcting my daughter’s error only 
prevented her from learning something more important on 
her own. This is the way many of us unintentionally              
opportunities in our everyday lives to help our children 
cultivate their minds. Of course, we need to give our children 
the vocabulary they need to talk about the world around 
them. However, we need to guard against our natural impulse 
to offer imprudent help to our children. They need the time, 
the silence and the mental space to think and learn things for 
themselves.
