적절한 것은? [3점]
While women work long hours every day at home, since 
this work does not produce a wage, this is often 
(A) included / ignored  in considering the respective contributions 
of women and men in the family’s joint prosperity. When, 
however, a woman works outside the home and earns a 
wage, she contributes to the family’s prosperity more 
visibly. The w om an also has more voice, because of being 
less (B) dependent on / independent of  others. The higher status 
of women even affects ideas on the female child’s ‘due.’ So 
the freedom to seek and hold outside jobs can contribute to 
the (C) production / reduction  of women’s relative and absolute 
difficulties. Freedom in one area (that of being able to work 
outside the household) seems to help to foster freedom in 
others (in enhancing freedom from hunger, illness, and 
relative difficulties).
