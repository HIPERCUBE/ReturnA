The essence of a sense of time is the experience of 
things happening in a given sequence: that is, knowing 
that such and such a thing happened first, and then that 
happened. This basic experience of time is vital to the 
way we make sense of the world, as was entertainingly 
explored in a novel by Rob Grant about a world in which 
time runs backwards. For example, our understanding of 
the sequence determines how we see causal connection. 
In our world, St. Francis picked up injured birds, then he 
healed them and then he released them from his hand - a 
saintly action. In Grant’s backwards world the time 
sequence is reversed: healthy birds fly to Francis’ hands, 
then they are injured, and then he puts them down - a 
sequence of events that is more sadistic than saintly.
