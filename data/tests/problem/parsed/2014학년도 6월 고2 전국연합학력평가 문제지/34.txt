Each time a patient needs to have a wound dressing 
removed to check for infection, the healing process is 
interrupted and germs can get in. Now, a new dressing 
allows staff to tell if an infection is developing without even 
touching the patient. They only need to check a color strip 
on the outside of the dressing. The secret lies in a dye 
used in the dressing, which reacts to changing pH levels in 
the skin. “Healthy skin and healed wounds usually show a 
pH value of below 5,” says Dr. Sabine Trupp, a lead 
researcher at Munich’s Fraunhofer Research Institution, who 
developed the color strip. “If the pH value is between 6.5 
and 8.5, an infection is frequently present and the indicator 
color strip turns purple.”
