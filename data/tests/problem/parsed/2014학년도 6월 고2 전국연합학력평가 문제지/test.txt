18. 다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?
If you eat most of your meals in a cafeteria, how much 
control can you have over where your food comes from? 
Most cafeteria food seems to originate in a large freezer 
truck at the loading dock behind the dining hall. Any farm 
behind those boxes of frozen fries and hamburgers is far 
away and hard to imagine. At a growing number of colleges, 
students are speaking up about becoming local food eaters. 
Many other schools have started asking the dining service to 
provide local foods because they’re concerned about the local 
farm economy, and because they’re worried about the 
environmental costs of foods that travel thousands of miles 
from the farm to the table. And now, it’s our turn!

Henri Matisse and Auguste Renoir were dear friends and 
frequent companions. When Renoir was confined to his home 
during the last decade of his life, Matisse visited ① him 
daily. Renoir, almost paralyzed by arthritis, continued to 
paint in spite of his illness. One day, as Matisse watched 
② the painter working in his studio, fighting torturous pain 
with each brush stroke, ③ he said abruptly: “Why do you 
continue to paint when you are in such agony?” Renoir 
answered simply: “The beauty remains; the pain passes.” 
And so, almost to ④ his dying day, Renoir put paint to 
canvas. One of his most famous paintings, The Bathers, was 
completed just two years before his passing, 14 years after 
⑤ he was stricken by the disabling disease.
* arthritis: 관절염
20. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Recently, while cycling to work, I had my first flat. So I 
borrowed a pump from a passing cyclist and discovered that 
the tube was useless. Then I heard someone shouting at me, 
“What happened?” I turned around and saw the smiling face 
of another cyclist. I explained my situation to him, to which 
he replied, “I’ll buy the tube for you.” I gave him the money 
and he got on his way. Within 20 minutes my savior was 
back - but the tube he’d bought didn’t fit. He willingly 
turned around for another trip. After half an hour he was 
back with the full kit and in no time I was good to go. 
Since that day, I’ve been on the lookout for other cyclists in 
trouble so that I can repay my debt.
① worried → angry ② ashamed → proud
③ frustrated → grateful ④ envious → satisfied
⑤ comfortable → terrified

Jack Welch is considered to be one of the USA’s top 
business leaders. In a gesture ① that was at once symbolic 
and real, Welch directed the ceremonial burning of the 
old­fashioned GE Blue Books. The Blue Books were a series 
of management training manuals that told how GE managers 
were to get tasks ② done in the organization. Despite the 
fact that these books for training ③ had not been used for 
some 15 years, they still had great influence over the 
actions of GE managers. ④ Cited the need for managers to 
write their own answers to day­to­day management 
challenges, Welch swept away the old order by removing the 
Blue Books from the organization’s culture. Now, GE 
managers are taught to find their own solutions rather than 
⑤ look them up in a dusty old book.

If idling away in front of a TV is your favorite daily 
hobby, it may lead you to an early death. That’s what 
Australian researchers found after tracking nearly 9,000 
people for an average of six years. Regardless of whether or 
not they were overweight, subjects who watched television 
for more than four hours daily had a 46 percent higher risk 
of premature death, compared with subjects who channel­surfed 
for less than two hours a day. “Television itself isn’t the 
problem,” says study author David Dunstan. Instead, the 
danger comes from all that sitting, which takes the place of 
activity - including even the lightest kind that naturally 
occurs when you are not glued to the tube. “Too much 
sitting is, simply, bad for you,” Dunstan says.
① 비만은 조기 사망의 주요인이다.
② TV 채널을 다양화할 필요가 있다.
③ 자녀의 TV 시청 시간을 제한해야 한다.
④ 장시간 앉아 있는 것은 허리 통증을 유발한다.
⑤ TV 시청으로 인한 움직임의 부족은 건강에 해롭다.

23. Not only is it easy to lie with maps, but it’s essential. A 
map must distort reality in order to portray a complex, 
three­dimensional world on a flat sheet of paper. To take a 
simple example, a map is a scale model, but the symbols it 
uses for parks, restaurants, and other places are not drawn 
to the same scale, which - if taken literally - would make 
them much bigger or smaller in reality. Furthermore, a map 
cannot show everything, or it will hide critical information in 
a fog of detail. The map, therefore, must offer a selective, 
incomplete view of reality. There’s no escape from the 
map­making paradox: to present a useful and truthful picture, 
an accurate map must                        . [3점]
* scale model: 축척 모형
① show details
② tell white lies
③ use more symbols
④ be multi­dimensional
⑤ be drawn at full size
24. We get pleasure by reading a book. When we read a book 
about the people who have a lot in common with us, it 
doubles the pleasure, leading us beyond our own lives and 
allowing us to understand those of others. But this is not 
the only reason for the pleasure we derive from books. In 
everyday life we are so involved in what is happening - so 
much affected by our emotions that we can not appreciate 
them properly. Of course, our own lives would be a novel worthy 
of Dickens or Hemingway, but we get no pleasure from our 
lives - quite the contrary. Therefore, the writer’s task is to 
give us a faithful picture of life, but _________________________ 
for us to be able to appreciate it without fear or confusion.

There is a    (A)    principle in human perception that 
affects the way we see the difference between two things 
that are presented one after another. For example, each 
student in the psychophysics laboratory takes a turn sitting 
in front of three buckets of water - one cold, one at room 
temperature, and one hot. After placing one hand in the cold 
water and one in the hot water, the student is told to place 
both in the lukewarm water simultaneously. Then something 
surprising happens. Even though both hands are in the same 
bucket, the hand that was in the cold water feels as if it is 
now in the hot water, while the one in the hot water feels 
as if it is in cold water. The point is that the same thing 
can be made to seem very different, depending on the nature of 
the event that     (B)     it.

College students know that when they enter a classroom 
on the first day of class, they should not walk to the front 
of the room and give instructions to the class.   (A)  , 
professors know that on the first day of class, students 
expect them to give an overview of the course and lay out 
expectations such as no texting during class. Usually, 
however, some room for negotiation exists; that is, the 
parties involved have the option of negotiating a social 
order. So on the first day of class, a professor may 
negotiate with students, indicating it is okay to check text 
messages when the professor is passing out assignments but 
not during lecture or class discussion.    (B)   , professors 
know that they cannot ‘negotiate’ a social order in which 
students pay money to receive a desired grade.

적절한 것은? [3점]
While women work long hours every day at home, since 
this work does not produce a wage, this is often 
(A) included / ignored  in considering the respective contributions 
of women and men in the family’s joint prosperity. When, 
however, a woman works outside the home and earns a 
wage, she contributes to the family’s prosperity more 
visibly. The w om an also has more voice, because of being 
less (B) dependent on / independent of  others. The higher status 
of women even affects ideas on the female child’s ‘due.’ So 
the freedom to seek and hold outside jobs can contribute to 
the (C) production / reduction  of women’s relative and absolute 
difficulties. Freedom in one area (that of being able to work 
outside the household) seems to help to foster freedom in 
others (in enhancing freedom from hunger, illness, and 
relative difficulties).

28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지

Suspense takes up a great share of our interest in life. A 
play or a novel is often robbed of much of its interest if 
you know the plot ① beforehand. We like to keep guessing 
as to the outcome. The circus acrobat employs this principle 
when he achieves a feat after purposely ② failing to perform 
it several times. Even the deliberate manner in which he 
arranges the opening scene ③ increases our expectation. In 
the last act of a play, a little circus dog balances a ball on 
its nose. One night when the dog ④ hesitated and worked 
with a long time before he would perform his feat, he got a 
lot more applause than when he did his trick at once. We 
not only like to wait, feeling ⑤ relieved, but we appreciate 
what we wait for.

30. Mallard에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The mallard is one of the most popular ducks among 
waterbird hunters and bird watchers. It’s commonly seen in 
ponds and lakes throughout Minnesota. It is most easily 
recognized by the male’s glossy green head and white neck 
collar. Mallards are very vocal; males have a low­pitched 
call, and hens use a loud, long series of quacks. In Minnesota, 
mallards mate in late winter or early spring. Nests are built 
in dense vegetation, and hens lay 5 to 14 eggs, which take 
26 to 30 days to hatch. Interestingly, mallards swim with 
their tail held above the water, so when trouble comes, they 
can spring directly out of the water and into the air.

The graph above shows how Koreans perceived their own 
social status in 2009 and 2011. ① In general, more people 
thought they belonged to the middle class than the other 
two classes in each year. ② The percent of people regarding 
themselves as a member of the middle class slid from 53.0  
in 2009 to 52.8 in 2011. ③ On the other hand, the figure 
for those who thought they belonged to the lower class 
climbed to 45.3 percent in 2011, up 0.6 percent, compared to 
two years earlier. ④ Meanwhile, the figure for the upper 
class dropped slightly to 1.9 percent in 2011, down 0.4 
percent from 2009. ⑤ The decrease rate of the upper class 
was three times as high as that of the middle class from 
2009 to 2011.

32. Many cities are finding that artificial wetlands provide a 
low­cost way to filter and treat outflowing sewage. Arcata, 
California, for instance, needed an expensive sewer plant 
upgrade. Instead, the city transformed a 65 hectare garbage 
dump into a series of ponds and marshes that serve as a 
simple, low­cost, waste treatment facility. Arcata saved 
millions of dollars and improved its environment simultaneously. 
The marsh is a home for wildlife and has become a prized 
recreation area for the city. Eventually, the purified water 
from the artificial wetlands flows into Humboldt Bay, where 
marine life flourishes. Constructed marshes allow industrial 
cooling water to become clean before entering streams or 
other surface water bodies. All these created wetlands can 
be useful to both humans and wildlife.
* sewage: 하수 오물
① benefits of artificial wetlands for filtering sewage
② environmental effects of illegal garbage dumping
③ introduction of new marine species to marshes
④ importance of preserving wildlife in wetlands
⑤ difficulty of remodeling sewer plants
33. You’re buying a used car, moving into a new apartment, or 
determining which doctor should treat your cancer. These 
are times when you need to get directly to the core of an 
issue. “Asking general questions gets you little valuable 
information, and may even yield misleading responses,” says 
Julia Minson, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. 
The best way is to ask probing questions that suppose there 
are problems. Let’s say someone is selling a used music 
player. An example of a general question is “What can you 
tell me about it?” A positive­assumption question is “There 
aren’t any problems with it, right?” But a negative­assumption 
question such as “What problems have you had with it?” will 
get the most honest response.
① questioning method to draw meaningful information
② how to answer the negative­assumption questions
③ misleading responses to make problems worse
④ considerations when choosing used products 
⑤ strategies to produce positive responses

Each time a patient needs to have a wound dressing 
removed to check for infection, the healing process is 
interrupted and germs can get in. Now, a new dressing 
allows staff to tell if an infection is developing without even 
touching the patient. They only need to check a color strip 
on the outside of the dressing. The secret lies in a dye 
used in the dressing, which reacts to changing pH levels in 
the skin. “Healthy skin and healed wounds usually show a 
pH value of below 5,” says Dr. Sabine Trupp, a lead 
researcher at Munich’s Fraunhofer Research Institution, who 
developed the color strip. “If the pH value is between 6.5 
and 8.5, an infection is frequently present and the indicator 
color strip turns purple.”

35. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Our primary sense is vision, occupying up to one­third of 
our brain. A dog’s brain, however, is centered on smell. ① It 
holds at least 20 times more olfactory neurons than the 
human brain. ② This is why a dog is generally more sensitive 
to movement but sees only about 75 percent of the detail 
we see. ③ According to San Diego animal behaviorist Dennis 
Fetko, the best man­made instruments for smell can detect a 
chemical in amounts as small as one trillionth of a gram. 
④ But a bloodhound dog can detect from a distance what the 
instruments cannot detect at the source! ⑤ It is believed 
that a bloodhound can accurately follow a trail by nose for 
more than 100 miles.

You may know the classic myth of Icarus and Daedalus. 
The tale is tragic and it reminds us that our safety 
requires obedience, especially to our parents when we 
are not yet adults.
(A) However, not all of us who pursue our dreams are so 
reckless as to do something dangerous, just as Icarus 
flew too close to the sun. As we mature, we know that 
we must balance courage with caution.
(B) At the same time, we know that if everyone were motivated 
by fear, then nothing creative or progressive would ever 
be achieved. Therefore, we try to respect and keep alive 
our dreams and aspirations.

Each year billions of unwanted fish and other animals die 
from these inefficient, illegal, and destructive fishing 
practices.
For centuries, people looked to the oceans as an unlimited 
source of food supply. ( ① ) Though, 76 percent of the 
world’s fisheries have recently suffered from thoughtless 
exploitation and over­fishing. ( ② ) How can we save such 
precious resources? ( ③ ) We can do it by consuming seafood 
in moderation and choosing only seafood that comes from 
sustainable fisheries. ( ④ ) Now several guides are available 
that let you know what types of seafood you can eat or 
should avoid due to the declining populations in the wild. 
( ⑤ ) Your choice as a consumer could possibly encourage 
more fisheries to change their practices to make way for 
healthier oceans.

However, we are constrained by the scarcity of 
resources, including a limited availability of time.
The reality of life on our planet is that productive 
resources are limited, while the human desire for goods 
and services is virtually unlimited. ( ① ) Would you like to 
have some new clothes, a luxury boat, or a vacation in the 
Swiss Alps? ( ② ) You may dream of driving a brand­new 
car into the driveway of your oceanfront house. ( ③ )
Most of us would like to have all of these things and many 
others. ( ④ ) Because we cannot have as much of 
everything as we would like, we are forced to choose 
among alternatives. ( ⑤ ) There is no free lunch: doing 
one thing makes us sacrifice other opportunities.

The essence of a sense of time is the experience of 
things happening in a given sequence: that is, knowing 
that such and such a thing happened first, and then that 
happened. This basic experience of time is vital to the 
way we make sense of the world, as was entertainingly 
explored in a novel by Rob Grant about a world in which 
time runs backwards. For example, our understanding of 
the sequence determines how we see causal connection. 
In our world, St. Francis picked up injured birds, then he 
healed them and then he released them from his hand - a 
saintly action. In Grant’s backwards world the time 
sequence is reversed: healthy birds fly to Francis’ hands, 
then they are injured, and then he puts them down - a 
sequence of events that is more sadistic than saintly.

Formal organizations such as multinational corporations 
train workers to perform their jobs in a certain way and 
reward them for good performance. When workers are 
trained to respond mindlessly to the dictates of the job, 
however, they risk developing trained incapacity - the 
inability to respond to new or unusual circumstances or 
to recognize when official rules or procedures do not 
apply or may be doing harm. In other words, workers are 
trained to do their jobs in an efficient way to meet 
organizational goals while ignoring other important matters 
related to their health, the community, and the 
environment. At the root of trained incapacity is a job 
with little variety and repetitive tasks. Economist 
Thorstein Veblen argues that as variety in work 
decreases, the amount of thought and time needed to 
perform a job also decreases.

How do you relax yourself when things seem scary? One 
way is to understand that our bodies are machines that 
were designed in ancient times when our reflexes had to 
be quicker for survival. Our lives are evidence for those of 
our ancestors who possessed quick reflexes: slower 
ancestors didn’t live long enough to pass their genes along.
Breathing is the key to      . The fight or flight 
response - our age­old response to real or imagined threat
- depends on delivering oxygen quickly and efficiently to 
muscles that need to be ready for action. During this 
adrenaline rush, your heart rate increases, your blood 
vessels redirect blood supply, and you begin to sweat. Real 
or perceived danger throws the body into overdrive, 
literally. Thus, it is necessary to control your breathing. 
Ordinarily, we parallel breath, in and out. To enter into a 
more relaxed state, practice square breathing, which is 
inhaling to the count of four, and holding to the count of 
four, exhaling to the count of four, and holding for four. 
With practice, you can increase the intervals and slow 
things down even more. Not only is square breathing good 
for confidence building, but it is also good for relaxation, 
talking to the boss about a raise, preparing for a speech, or 
going out on a date.

[43~45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
I was running late. My wife, Eleanor, and I had agreed to 
meet at the restaurant at seven o’clock, and it was already 
half past. I had a good excuse: a client meeting had run 
over, and I’d wasted no time getting to the dinner as 
quickly as possible. When I arrived at the restaurant, I 
apologized and told my wife I didn’t mean to be late. She 
answered, “You never mean to be late.” Uh­oh, she was 
mad. “Sorry,” I replied. “It was unavoidable.” I told her about 
the client meeting. Not only did my explanation not soothe 
her, it seemed to make things worse. And that started to 
make (a) me angry.
(B)
In other words, he meant, I was focused on my 
intention, while Eleanor was focused on the consequences. 
She and I were having two different conversations. In the 
end, we both felt unacknowledged, misunderstood, and 
angry. The more I thought about what Ken had said, the 
more (b) I  recognized that this battle - intention vs. 
consequences - was the root cause of so much 
interpersonal discord.
(C)
As it turns out, it’s not the thought that counts or even 
the action that counts. That’s because Eleanor doesn’t 
experience (c) my thought or action. She experiences the 
consequences of my action. From this battle, I came to 
realize that when I do something that upsets her or 
someone else - no matter who’s right - I should always start 
the conversation by acknowledging how my actions affected 
the other person. After all, my intentions don’t matter much.
(D)
Several weeks later, when I described the situation to a 
friend who is a professor of family therapy, Ken Hardy, he 
smiled. “You made a classic mistake as (d) I  did,” he told 
me. “You’re stuck in your perspective,” he said. “You didn’t 
mean to be late. But that’s not the point. The point - and 
what’s important in (e) your communication - is how your 
lateness affected Eleanor.”
