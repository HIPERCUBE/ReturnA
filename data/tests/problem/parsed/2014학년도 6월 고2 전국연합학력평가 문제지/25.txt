affects the way we see the difference between two things 
that are presented one after another. For example, each 
student in the psychophysics laboratory takes a turn sitting 
in front of three buckets of water - one cold, one at room

bucket, the hand that was in the cold water feels as if it is 
now in the hot water, while the one in the hot water feels 
as if it is in cold water. The point is that the same thing 
can be made to seem very different, depending on the nature of 
the event that     (B)     it.
* lukewarm: 미지근한
