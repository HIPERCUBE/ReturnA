20. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Recently, while cycling to work, I had my first flat. So I 
borrowed a pump from a passing cyclist and discovered that 
the tube was useless. Then I heard someone shouting at me, 
“What happened?” I turned around and saw the smiling face 
of another cyclist. I explained my situation to him, to which 
he replied, “I’ll buy the tube for you.” I gave him the money 
and he got on his way. Within 20 minutes my savior was 
back - but the tube he’d bought didn’t fit. He willingly 
turned around for another trip. After half an hour he was 
back with the full kit and in no time I was good to go. 
Since that day, I’ve been on the lookout for other cyclists in 
trouble so that I can repay my debt.
