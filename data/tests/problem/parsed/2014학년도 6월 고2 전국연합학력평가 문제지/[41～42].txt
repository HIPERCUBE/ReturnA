How do you relax yourself when things seem scary? One 
way is to understand that our bodies are machines that 
were designed in ancient times when our reflexes had to 
be quicker for survival. Our lives are evidence for those of 
our ancestors who possessed quick reflexes: slower 
ancestors didn’t live long enough to pass their genes along.
Breathing is the key to      . The fight or flight 
response - our age­old response to real or imagined threat
- depends on delivering oxygen quickly and efficiently to 
muscles that need to be ready for action. During this 
adrenaline rush, your heart rate increases, your blood 
vessels redirect blood supply, and you begin to sweat. Real 
or perceived danger throws the body into overdrive, 
literally. Thus, it is necessary to control your breathing. 
Ordinarily, we parallel breath, in and out. To enter into a 
more relaxed state, practice square breathing, which is 
inhaling to the count of four, and holding to the count of 
four, exhaling to the count of four, and holding for four. 
With practice, you can increase the intervals and slow 
things down even more. Not only is square breathing good 
for confidence building, but it is also good for relaxation, 
talking to the boss about a raise, preparing for a speech, or 
going out on a date.
