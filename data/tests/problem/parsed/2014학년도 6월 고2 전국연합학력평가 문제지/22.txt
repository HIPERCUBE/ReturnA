If idling away in front of a TV is your favorite daily 
hobby, it may lead you to an early death. That’s what 
Australian researchers found after tracking nearly 9,000 
people for an average of six years. Regardless of whether or 
not they were overweight, subjects who watched television 
for more than four hours daily had a 46 percent higher risk 
of premature death, compared with subjects who channel­surfed 
for less than two hours a day. “Television itself isn’t the 
problem,” says study author David Dunstan. Instead, the 
danger comes from all that sitting, which takes the place of 
activity - including even the lightest kind that naturally 
occurs when you are not glued to the tube. “Too much 
sitting is, simply, bad for you,” Dunstan says.
