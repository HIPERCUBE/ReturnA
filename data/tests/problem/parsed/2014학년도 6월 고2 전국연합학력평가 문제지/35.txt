Our primary sense is vision, occupying up to one­third of 
our brain. A dog’s brain, however, is centered on smell. ① It 
holds at least 20 times more olfactory neurons than the 
human brain. ② This is why a dog is generally more sensitive 
to movement but sees only about 75 percent of the detail 
we see. ③ According to San Diego animal behaviorist Dennis 
Fetko, the best man­made instruments for smell can detect a 
chemical in amounts as small as one trillionth of a gram. 
④ But a bloodhound dog can detect from a distance what the 
instruments cannot detect at the source! ⑤ It is believed 
that a bloodhound can accurately follow a trail by nose for 
more than 100 miles.
