Suspense takes up a great share of our interest in life. A 
play or a novel is often robbed of much of its interest if 
you know the plot ① beforehand. We like to keep guessing 
as to the outcome. The circus acrobat employs this principle 
when he achieves a feat after purposely ② failing to perform 
it several times. Even the deliberate manner in which he 
arranges the opening scene ③ increases our expectation. In 
the last act of a play, a little circus dog balances a ball on 
its nose. One night when the dog ④ hesitated and worked 
with a long time before he would perform his feat, he got a 
lot more applause than when he did his trick at once. We 
not only like to wait, feeling ⑤ relieved, but we appreciate 
what we wait for.
