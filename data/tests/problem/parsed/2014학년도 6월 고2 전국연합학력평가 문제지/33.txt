33. You’re buying a used car, moving into a new apartment, or 
determining which doctor should treat your cancer. These 
are times when you need to get directly to the core of an 
issue. “Asking general questions gets you little valuable 
information, and may even yield misleading responses,” says 
Julia Minson, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. 
The best way is to ask probing questions that suppose there 
are problems. Let’s say someone is selling a used music 
player. An example of a general question is “What can you 
tell me about it?” A positive­assumption question is “There 
aren’t any problems with it, right?” But a negative­assumption 
question such as “What problems have you had with it?” will 
get the most honest response.

② how to answer the negative­assumption questions
③ misleading responses to make problems worse
④ considerations when choosing used products 
⑤ strategies to produce positive responses
