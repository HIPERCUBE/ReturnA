Henri Matisse and Auguste Renoir were dear friends and 
frequent companions. When Renoir was confined to his home 
during the last decade of his life, Matisse visited ① him 
daily. Renoir, almost paralyzed by arthritis, continued to 
paint in spite of his illness. One day, as Matisse watched 
② the painter working in his studio, fighting torturous pain 
with each brush stroke, ③ he said abruptly: “Why do you 
continue to paint when you are in such agony?” Renoir 
answered simply: “The beauty remains; the pain passes.” 
And so, almost to ④ his dying day, Renoir put paint to 
canvas. One of his most famous paintings, The Bathers, was 
completed just two years before his passing, 14 years after 
⑤ he was stricken by the disabling disease.
