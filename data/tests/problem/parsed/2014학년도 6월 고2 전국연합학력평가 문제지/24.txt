24. We get pleasure by reading a book. When we read a book 
about the people who have a lot in common with us, it 
doubles the pleasure, leading us beyond our own lives and 
allowing us to understand those of others. But this is not 
the only reason for the pleasure we derive from books. In 
everyday life we are so involved in what is happening - so 
much affected by our emotions that we can not appreciate 
them properly. Of course, our own lives would be a novel worthy 
of Dickens or Hemingway, but we get no pleasure from our 
lives - quite the contrary. Therefore, the writer’s task is to 
give us a faithful picture of life, but _________________________ 
for us to be able to appreciate it without fear or confusion.
