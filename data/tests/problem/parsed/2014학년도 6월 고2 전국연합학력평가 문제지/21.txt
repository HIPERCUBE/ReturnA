Jack Welch is considered to be one of the USA’s top 
business leaders. In a gesture ① that was at once symbolic 
and real, Welch directed the ceremonial burning of the 
old­fashioned GE Blue Books. The Blue Books were a series 
of management training manuals that told how GE managers 
were to get tasks ② done in the organization. Despite the 
fact that these books for training ③ had not been used for 
some 15 years, they still had great influence over the 
actions of GE managers. ④ Cited the need for managers to 
write their own answers to day­to­day management 
challenges, Welch swept away the old order by removing the 
Blue Books from the organization’s culture. Now, GE 
managers are taught to find their own solutions rather than 
⑤ look them up in a dusty old book.
