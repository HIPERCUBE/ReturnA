(A)
I was running late. My wife, Eleanor, and I had agreed to 
meet at the restaurant at seven o’clock, and it was already 
half past. I had a good excuse: a client meeting had run 
over, and I’d wasted no time getting to the dinner as 
quickly as possible. When I arrived at the restaurant, I 
apologized and told my wife I didn’t mean to be late. She 
answered, “You never mean to be late.” Uh­oh, she was 
mad. “Sorry,” I replied. “It was unavoidable.” I told her about 
the client meeting. Not only did my explanation not soothe 
her, it seemed to make things worse. And that started to 
make (a) me angry.
(B)
In other words, he meant, I was focused on my 
intention, while Eleanor was focused on the consequences. 
She and I were having two different conversations. In the 
end, we both felt unacknowledged, misunderstood, and 
angry. The more I thought about what Ken had said, the 
more (b) I  recognized that this battle - intention vs. 
consequences - was the root cause of so much 
interpersonal discord.
(C)
As it turns out, it’s not the thought that counts or even 
the action that counts. That’s because Eleanor doesn’t 
experience (c) my thought or action. She experiences the 
consequences of my action. From this battle, I came to 
realize that when I do something that upsets her or 
someone else - no matter who’s right - I should always start 
the conversation by acknowledging how my actions affected 
the other person. After all, my intentions don’t matter much.
(D)
Several weeks later, when I described the situation to a 
friend who is a professor of family therapy, Ken Hardy, he 
smiled. “You made a classic mistake as (d) I  did,” he told 
me. “You’re stuck in your perspective,” he said. “You didn’t 
mean to be late. But that’s not the point. The point - and 
what’s important in (e) your communication - is how your 
lateness affected Eleanor.”
