32. Many cities are finding that artificial wetlands provide a 
low­cost way to filter and treat outflowing sewage. Arcata, 
California, for instance, needed an expensive sewer plant 
upgrade. Instead, the city transformed a 65 hectare garbage 
dump into a series of ponds and marshes that serve as a 
simple, low­cost, waste treatment facility. Arcata saved 
millions of dollars and improved its environment simultaneously. 
The marsh is a home for wildlife and has become a prized 
recreation area for the city. Eventually, the purified water 
from the artificial wetlands flows into Humboldt Bay, where 
marine life flourishes. Constructed marshes allow industrial 
cooling water to become clean before entering streams or 
other surface water bodies. All these created wetlands can 
be useful to both humans and wildlife.
