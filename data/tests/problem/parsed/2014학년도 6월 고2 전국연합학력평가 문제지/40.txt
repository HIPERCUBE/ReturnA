Formal organizations such as multinational corporations 
train workers to perform their jobs in a certain way and 
reward them for good performance. When workers are 
trained to respond mindlessly to the dictates of the job, 
however, they risk developing trained incapacity - the 
inability to respond to new or unusual circumstances or 
to recognize when official rules or procedures do not 
apply or may be doing harm. In other words, workers are 
trained to do their jobs in an efficient way to meet 
organizational goals while ignoring other important matters 
related to their health, the community, and the 
environment. At the root of trained incapacity is a job 
with little variety and repetitive tasks. Economist 
Thorstein Veblen argues that as variety in work 
decreases, the amount of thought and time needed to 
perform a job also decreases.
