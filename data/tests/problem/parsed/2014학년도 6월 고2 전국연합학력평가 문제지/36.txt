You may know the classic myth of Icarus and Daedalus. 
The tale is tragic and it reminds us that our safety 
requires obedience, especially to our parents when we 
are not yet adults.
(A) However, not all of us who pursue our dreams are so 
reckless as to do something dangerous, just as Icarus 
flew too close to the sun. As we mature, we know that 
we must balance courage with caution.
(B) At the same time, we know that if everyone were motivated 
by fear, then nothing creative or progressive would ever 
be achieved. Therefore, we try to respect and keep alive 
our dreams and aspirations.
(C) It’s easy to forget that our parents often know better, 
but they do. Though our parents might seem out of step 
with the times, they have a great deal more wisdom 
and experience.
