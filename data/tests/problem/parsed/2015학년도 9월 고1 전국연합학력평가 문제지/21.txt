Science fiction involves much more than shiny robots and 
fantastical spaceships. In fact, many of the most outlandish 
pieces of science fiction have their basis in scientific facts. 
Because a great deal of science fiction is rooted in science, 
it can be used to bring literature out of the English 
classroom and into the science classroom. Not only does 
science fiction help students see scientific principles in 
action, but it also builds their critical thinking and creative 
skills. As students read a science fiction text, they must 
connect the text with the scientific principles they have 
learned. Students can read a science fiction text and a 
non­fiction text covering similar ideas and compare and 
contrast the two. Students can also build their creative 
skills by seeing scientific principles used in a different 
way, possibly creating science fiction stories of their own 
or imagining new ways to apply the knowledge and skills 
they have learned.
