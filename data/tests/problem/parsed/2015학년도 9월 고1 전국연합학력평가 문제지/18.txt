Two years ago, Green County Library decided to stay  
open until 8 p.m. every Thursday. This was to make library 
services available to people for whom evening was the only 
convenient time to visit. However, visitor numbers have not 
shown a strong demand for the later hours, and library 
officials determined that staff time would be more 
effectively utilized by adjusting operating hours. So I have 
to inform you that hours of operation at Green County 
Library will change starting October 8, 2015. Operating 
hours on Thursdays will return to normal, from 9 a.m. to 6 
p.m.. All normal library services will still be available 
during those hours. Additionally, the shift will allow Green 
County Library to improve and increase services to the 
community.
