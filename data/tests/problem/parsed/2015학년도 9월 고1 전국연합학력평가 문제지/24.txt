Clara Barton was born on Christmas Day in 1821 in 
Massachusetts. At the age of seventeen, Barton began to 
work as a schoolteacher in a summer school and later 
decided to get a degree in education. She went to college 
in New York and graduated in 1851. She worked at a 
private school and eventually opened her own school in 
New Jersey in 1853. After that, she worked for a 
government office in Washington D.C., where she was fired 
just because she was a woman. It made her fight for the 
rights of women to be treated equally in the work place. 
Throughout the Civil War, Barton nursed wounded soldiers 
back to health and became known as the “Angel of the 
Battlefield.” While traveling overseas Barton learned of an 
organization called the International Red Cross. She wanted 
to bring the organization to America. It took a lot of effort, 
but Barton finally founded the American Red Cross in 1881.
