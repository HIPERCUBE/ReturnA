Two years ago, Green County Library decided to stay  
open until 8 p.m. every Thursday. This was to make library 
services available to people for whom evening was the only 
convenient time to visit. However, visitor numbers have not 
shown a strong demand for the later hours, and library 
officials determined that staff time would be more 
effectively utilized by adjusting operating hours. So I have 
to inform you that hours of operation at Green County 
Library will change starting October 8, 2015. Operating 
hours on Thursdays will return to normal, from 9 a.m. to 6 
p.m.. All normal library services will still be available 
during those hours. Additionally, the shift will allow Green 
County Library to improve and increase services to the 
community.

You’ve probably looked around you and noticed that all 
people are unique and different. Even people who might seem 
really similar in certain ways can also be very different. 
From different appearances, to different personalities, to 
different beliefs ― it’s a big world full of interesting and 
diverse people! It is tolerance that protects the diversity 
which makes the world so exciting. Tolerance is the idea that 
all people should be equally accepted and equally treated, 
regardless of their differences from others. It’s a lot like 
fairness. Having tolerance means giving every person the 
same consideration, despite a person’s opinions, background, 
appearance, or other qualities, and whether or not those 
things are the same as your own. Tolerance allows the world 
to flourish. That is why treating other people with tolerance 
is very important.

Have you ever heard anyone say, “I had to carry the 
ball”? The expression “to carry the ball” means to take 
responsibility for getting something done. We use clichés 
like this every day in our speech. These expressions are 
colorful and often appealing in their economy and ability to 
convey an image or description of an emotion or situation. 
Someone may be “cold as ice” or “busy as a bee.” A story 
may be “too funny for words.” These expressions in speech 
do little harm. In writing, however, clichés suffer the fate 
of the familiar becoming boring. Your reader has heard and 
read these expressions so often that they tend to “bounce 
off” the reader so swiftly that they lose their appeal. 
Therefore, if you want your writing to be stronger and 
more effective, try not to use clichés. Clichés in writing 
ultimately diminish the strength and effectiveness of your 
message.

21. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Science fiction involves much more than shiny robots and 
fantastical spaceships. In fact, many of the most outlandish 
pieces of science fiction have their basis in scientific facts. 
Because a great deal of science fiction is rooted in science, 
it can be used to bring literature out of the English 
classroom and into the science classroom. Not only does 
science fiction help students see scientific principles in 
action, but it also builds their critical thinking and creative 
skills. As students read a science fiction text, they must 
connect the text with the scientific principles they have 
learned. Students can read a science fiction text and a 
non­fiction text covering similar ideas and compare and 
contrast the two. Students can also build their creative 
skills by seeing scientific principles used in a different 
way, possibly creating science fiction stories of their own 
or imagining new ways to apply the knowledge and skills 
they have learned. 
* outlandish: 이상한, 기이한
① common themes in science fiction movies
② influence of science fiction on popular culture
③ examples of scientific principles in science fiction
④ historical development of the science fiction genre
⑤ benefits of using science fiction in the science classroom
22. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Consider an innocent question asked years ago by a son 
to his father: “Who invented the automobile?” Trying to be 
instructive, the father told his son that in about 1886 Karl 
Benz invented the automobile. “Wow, he must have been a 
real genius to figure out the engine, the brakes, the spark 
plugs, the wheels, and how everything worked together!” 
“Well, someone else invented the tires; I think it was 
Firestone. And then there was even the person who 
invented the wheel....” But then he experienced a moment 
of realization. “I think I may have misled you. No one 
person invented all of the components of the automobile. 
Many people made significant discoveries that led to the 
invention of the automobile.”

23. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Having watched the older children opening their gifts,     
I already knew that the big gifts were not necessarily the 
nicest ones. One girl my age got a large coloring book of 
historic characters, while a less greedy girl who selected a 
smaller box received a beautiful hairpin. As my turn came 
closer, my heart beat faster with anticipation. As I looked 
into the sack, I quickly fingered the remaining presents, 
testing their weight, imagining what they contained. I chose 
a small but heavy one that was wrapped in shiny silver foil 
and a red ribbon. It was a pack of batteries, which was not 
a gift I wished for. I had nothing to use them with! So I 
spent the rest of the party watching the other kids enjoying 
their gifts.

24. Clara Barton에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Clara Barton was born on Christmas Day in 1821 in 
Massachusetts. At the age of seventeen, Barton began to 
work as a schoolteacher in a summer school and later 
decided to get a degree in education. She went to college 
in New York and graduated in 1851. She worked at a 
private school and eventually opened her own school in 
New Jersey in 1853. After that, she worked for a 
government office in Washington D.C., where she was fired 
just because she was a woman. It made her fight for the 
rights of women to be treated equally in the work place. 
Throughout the Civil War, Barton nursed wounded soldiers 
back to health and became known as the “Angel of the 
Battlefield.” While traveling overseas Barton learned of an 
organization called the International Red Cross. She wanted 
to bring the organization to America. It took a lot of effort, 
but Barton finally founded the American Red Cross in 1881.

The Percentage of Male and Female Teachers 
in the UK, 2010  

The above graph shows the percentage of male and 
female teachers in five educational settings in the UK in 
2010. Overall, the percentage of females was larger than 
that of males in three out of five educational settings.  
① Females took the highest percentage in nursery schools, 
and the lowest in universities. ② The situation in nursery 
and primary schools was very one­sided, where over ninety 
percent of teachers were female. ③ In secondary schools, 
the percentage gap between male and female teachers was 
larger than that in primary schools. ④ However, there was 
no difference in the percentage of male and female 
teachers in colleges. ⑤ Males showed their highest 
percentage in universities, where the percentage of males 
was seventy percent.

Henry Kissinger was a master at getting people’s best 
work. His chief of staff once handed in a report ① he had 
written on foreign policy. When Kissinger received the 
report, he asked simply, “Is this ② your best work?” The 
chief thought for a moment and, worried that his boss would 
think the report was not good enough, responded, “Mr. 
Kissinger, ③ I can do better.” So Kissinger gave the report 
back. Two weeks later the chief turned in the revised 
report. Kissinger kept it for a week and then sent it back 
with a note that said, “Are you sure this is your best 
work?” Realizing that something must have been missing, the 
chief once again rewrote the report. This time when        
④ he handed the report to his boss he said, “Mr. Kissinger, 
this is my best work.” Upon hearing this, Kissinger replied, 
“Then this time ⑤ I will read your report.”

32. To fight productivity­slowing energy burnout typical in 
offices during the day, a design firm in Amsterdam has 
recently introduced a new method for ensuring that its 
employees go home on time and rest. Every day promptly 
at 6 p.m., everyone’s desks are raised to the ceiling by iron 
cables, and the space is then transformed into either a 
dance floor or yoga studio open for free to the community. 
The creative director of the firm, Sander Veenendaal, stated 
that this new measure has not only improved workers’ lives, 
but helped to build up their brand as well.             is 
becoming a serious priority in offices around the world 
hoping to achieve similar results. [3점]

33. When children turn four, they start to                 .  
If, for instance, you show a four­year­old a packet of gum 
and ask what’s inside, she’ll say, “Gum.” You open the packet 
and show her that inside there’s a pencil instead of gum. If 
you ask her what her mother, who’s waiting outside, will 
think is in the packet once it’s been reclosed, she’ll say, 
“Gum,” because she knows her mother hasn’t seen the pencil. 
But children under the age of four will generally say that 
their mother will think there’s a pencil inside because 
children of this age cannot yet imagine the world beyond 
their own reality. They think everyone knows what they 
know because they cannot model someone else’s mind and, 
in this case, realize that someone must see something in 
order to know it. [3점]

Humans rely heavily on communicating through the 
meaning found in words and the way they are arranged. We 
can tell someone we love them in a sad, happy, or soft 
tone of voice, which gives nuance to our feelings ― but the 
meaning of the words “I love you” remains the same. This 
is why “mixed signals” can be so confusing.    (A)   ,  
if a friend tells you that he or she likes you, you can 
interpret that in different ways, depending on the 
nonlanguage cues. If you hear “I like you” in a soft, upbeat 
tone and see your friend smiling and engaging you with 
friendly eye contact and body and arms relaxed, you will 
most likely believe that sentiment.    (B)   , if you hear 
“I like you” in an angry tone of voice while your friend 
exhibits no facial expression, avoids eye contact, and sits 
slightly turned away from you, with arms folded tightly, you 
would question his or her motive.

① How about sending an email saying there is a document 
attached without actually attaching the document?           
② Everyday mistakes like these happen all the time because 
our brains have to keep track of hundreds of different 
responses to thousands of different potential stimuli every 
hour of our waking lives. ③ Even though a second earlier we 
wrote that we were attaching a document to the email, the 
very next second our brain gives a command to our fingers 
to send the attachment­less email. ④ It is wise not to open 
email attachments from an unknown, doubtful, or 
untrustworthy source. ⑤ Sometimes we don’t even realize our 
mistake until we get an email from the addressee pointing it 
out.

Athletes often report that when they are doing well in 
their sport the size of the target looks incredibly large. 
(A) They had the players look at a poster with a variety 
of circles on it and asked them to indicate the circle 
they felt best represented the size of a softball. 
(B) They also collected from the players their “stats” from 
the game they had just completed so that the 
researchers could compute batting averages. They 
found those players who had better batting averages 
perceived the ball size as larger than those who had 
poorer ones.
(C) This is in contrast to the experience of the target 
looking incredibly small when the players are not 
doing well. To test this phenomenon, Jessica Witt and 
Dennis Proffitt recruited men and women softball 
players immediately after their games. [3점]

How can you tell the difference between a hard­boiled 
egg and a raw egg without breaking them? 
(A) When you take your finger away, the raw egg will 
continue to spin for a few more seconds, as the fluid 
inside is still moving. The hard­boiled egg will stop 
instantly.
(B) This is because the raw egg is fluid inside, whereas the 
hard­boiled egg is solid. When you spin the raw egg, 
the fluid inside moves around and causes the shaking. 
But the hard­boiled egg has no fluid like the raw egg, 
so it doesn’t shake. Put your finger briefly on the eggs 
to stop them spinning. 
(C) Spin both the eggs! You will find the hard­boiled egg 
spins so easily while the raw one doesn’t. Also, you 
will notice the raw egg will spin more slowly and it will 
shake!

Their commanding officer, relieved that his men had 
survived the snowstorm, asked how they made their way 
out.                   
M any years ago, a Hungarian military patrol was caught 
by a fierce snowstorm in the Swiss Alps. ( ① ) The 
soldiers were lost and frightened, but one of them found a 
map in his pocket. ( ② ) After consulting it, the soldiers 
built a shelter, planned their route, and then waited out the 
storm. ( ③ ) When the weather cleared three days later, 
they made their way back to the base camp. ( ④ )  
A young soldier showed the life­saving map to the officer, 
and he studied it carefully. ( ⑤ ) He was shocked to see 
that it was a map of the Pyrenees Mountains that border 
Spain and France, not the Swiss Alps.

However, they are unable to remember any of the words 
that they heard in the other ear, even if the same small 
set of words had been repeated a dozen times.
A classic psychological experiment asks a group of people 
to wear headphones. ( ① ) In this experiment, spoken 
words are played through the headphones, but a different 
set of words is played to each ear. ( ② ) Participants are 
told to listen to the words being sent to one ear (say the 
left ear) and to repeat them aloud. ( ③ ) When given 
these instructions, people are quite good at repeating the 
words that were spoken to that ear. ( ④ ) This example 
shows that much of the information that is available to your 
ears does not make it too far into your head. ( ⑤ ) You 
are selecting only a small amount of that information to be 
processed enough to know what words were being spoken.

As part of a research project, a group of undergraduate 
students watched a film, after which they were asked to 
describe it as fully as possible to other students. The 
listeners were actually research assistants, and for half 
the participants they assumed a positive listening style 
(smiling and nodding); for the other participants they 
assumed a negative listening style (frowning and 
unsmiling). Participants describing the film to positive 
listeners included more of their own opinions about what 
the film was trying to say. In contrast, participants 
speaking to negative listeners focused solely on objective 
facts and concrete details. The theory is that the smiles 
and nods of a listener signal interest and agreement, 
which in turn encourage the speaker to share more 
personal insights. Negative body language triggers a 
threat response that causes the speaker to pull back into 
the relative “safety” of facts.

Cultures have rarely been completely isolated from 
outside influence, because throughout human history people 
have been moving from one place to another, spreading 
goods and ideas. What is different today, though, is the 
speed and scope of these interactions. Several decades ago, 
overnight mail service and direct long­distance telephone 
calls increased the speed of cross­national communication. 
Advances in transportation technology have made 
international trade more cost­effective and international 
travel more accessible to ordinary citizens. Today the 
Internet has given people around the world immediate 
access to the cultural artifacts and ideals of other 
societies, no matter where they’re located. 
Clearly, societies are more interdependent than ever, and 
that matters for individuals. Sometimes the effects are 
positive. Medical discoveries in the United States or 
Europe, for instance, can save lives around the world. 
Globalization gives us a chance to learn about other 
societies and learn from them. Other times, however, 
global influence can have disastrous consequences. Many of 
today’s most urgent societal problems ― widespread 
environmental destruction, large­ and small­scale wars, 
economic crises, and so on ― are a function of globalization 
to some degree. 
In short, it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not 
impossible, to consider ourselves members of a single 
society           by other societies. All of us are 
members of our own society and citizens of a world 
community at the same time.

(A)
Evan, a young medical student, had to be away from his 
fiancée for three years to study at college in New York, 
far away from his hometown, New Orleans. To be 
separated so long from his love was heart­breaking for 
him. He was eager to go see (a) her, but he was too poor 
to buy a ticket for a long­distance bus to his hometown. 
He was sad and depressed. He would go to the bus station 
just to watch the buses for New Orleans drive away while 
sitting on an old wooden bench. 
(B)
He showed the woman her picture. The woman said, “Oh, 
(b) she is the most beautiful young woman I’ve ever seen.” 
Then she began to tell him that she had been married to a 
traveling salesman who had recently passed away. She told 
him how they used to weep, both of them, each time he
