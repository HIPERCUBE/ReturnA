How can you tell the difference between a hard­boiled 
egg and a raw egg without breaking them? 
(A) When you take your finger away, the raw egg will 
continue to spin for a few more seconds, as the fluid 
inside is still moving. The hard­boiled egg will stop 
instantly.
(B) This is because the raw egg is fluid inside, whereas the 
hard­boiled egg is solid. When you spin the raw egg, 
the fluid inside moves around and causes the shaking. 
But the hard­boiled egg has no fluid like the raw egg, 
so it doesn’t shake. Put your finger briefly on the eggs 
to stop them spinning. 
(C) Spin both the eggs! You will find the hard­boiled egg 
spins so easily while the raw one doesn’t. Also, you 
will notice the raw egg will spin more slowly and it will 
shake!
