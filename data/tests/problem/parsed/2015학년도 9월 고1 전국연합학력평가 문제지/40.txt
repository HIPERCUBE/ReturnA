As part of a research project, a group of undergraduate 
students watched a film, after which they were asked to 
describe it as fully as possible to other students. The 
listeners were actually research assistants, and for half 
the participants they assumed a positive listening style 
(smiling and nodding); for the other participants they 
assumed a negative listening style (frowning and 
unsmiling). Participants describing the film to positive 
listeners included more of their own opinions about what 
the film was trying to say. In contrast, participants 
speaking to negative listeners focused solely on objective 
facts and concrete details. The theory is that the smiles 
and nods of a listener signal interest and agreement, 
which in turn encourage the speaker to share more 
personal insights. Negative body language triggers a 
threat response that causes the speaker to pull back into 
the relative “safety” of facts.
