31. It is important to understand how vision works, because 
from the first time you start looking at a situation, you are 
also making use of                . If you are at a 
baseball game, how do you know where to look? If you 
have never been to a game before, then the whole thing is 
probably a complex mess. You may miss a lot of the 
action, because you can’t predict what is going to happen 
next. As you learn more about baseball and develop some 
understanding of the game, you learn where to look and 
what objects are important to find. At first you might focus 
on the pitcher and hitter. Later still, you might notice 
whether the infielder is playing in or back, or you might 
c h eck out where the outfielders have chosen to stand for a 
particular hitter. The more you know about baseball, the 
more that knowledge informs how you see a game. [3점]
