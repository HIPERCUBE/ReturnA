Consider an innocent question asked years ago by a son 
to his father: “Who invented the automobile?” Trying to be 
instructive, the father told his son that in about 1886 Karl 
Benz invented the automobile. “Wow, he must have been a 
real genius to figure out the engine, the brakes, the spark 
plugs, the wheels, and how everything worked together!” 
“Well, someone else invented the tires; I think it was 
Firestone. And then there was even the person who 
invented the wheel....” But then he experienced a moment 
of realization. “I think I may have misled you. No one 
person invented all of the components of the automobile. 
Many people made significant discoveries that led to the 
invention of the automobile.”
