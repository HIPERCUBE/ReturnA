Athletes often report that when they are doing well in 
their sport the size of the target looks incredibly large. 
(A) They had the players look at a poster with a variety 
of circles on it and asked them to indicate the circle 
they felt best represented the size of a softball. 
(B) They also collected from the players their “stats” from 
the game they had just completed so that the 
researchers could compute batting averages. They 
found those players who had better batting averages 
perceived the ball size as larger than those who had 
poorer ones.
(C) This is in contrast to the experience of the target 
looking incredibly small when the players are not 
doing well. To test this phenomenon, Jessica Witt and 
Dennis Proffitt recruited men and women softball 
players immediately after their games. [3점]
