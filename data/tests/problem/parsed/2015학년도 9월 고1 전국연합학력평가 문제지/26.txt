Henry Kissinger was a master at getting people’s best 
work. His chief of staff once handed in a report ① he had 
written on foreign policy. When Kissinger received the 
report, he asked simply, “Is this ② your best work?” The 
chief thought for a moment and, worried that his boss would 
think the report was not good enough, responded, “Mr. 
Kissinger, ③ I can do better.” So Kissinger gave the report 
back. Two weeks later the chief turned in the revised 
report. Kissinger kept it for a week and then sent it back 
with a note that said, “Are you sure this is your best 
work?” Realizing that something must have been missing, the 
chief once again rewrote the report. This time when        
④ he handed the report to his boss he said, “Mr. Kissinger, 
this is my best work.” Upon hearing this, Kissinger replied, 
“Then this time ⑤ I will read your report.”
