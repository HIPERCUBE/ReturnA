Their commanding officer, relieved that his men had 
survived the snowstorm, asked how they made their way 
out.                   
M any years ago, a Hungarian military patrol was caught 
by a fierce snowstorm in the Swiss Alps. ( ① ) The 
soldiers were lost and frightened, but one of them found a 
map in his pocket. ( ② ) After consulting it, the soldiers 
built a shelter, planned their route, and then waited out the 
storm. ( ③ ) When the weather cleared three days later, 
they made their way back to the base camp. ( ④ )  
A young soldier showed the life­saving map to the officer, 
and he studied it carefully. ( ⑤ ) He was shocked to see 
that it was a map of the Pyrenees Mountains that border 
Spain and France, not the Swiss Alps.
