33. When children turn four, they start to                 .  
If, for instance, you show a four­year­old a packet of gum 
and ask what’s inside, she’ll say, “Gum.” You open the packet 
and show her that inside there’s a pencil instead of gum. If 
you ask her what her mother, who’s waiting outside, will 
think is in the packet once it’s been reclosed, she’ll say, 
“Gum,” because she knows her mother hasn’t seen the pencil. 
But children under the age of four will generally say that 
their mother will think there’s a pencil inside because 
children of this age cannot yet imagine the world beyond 
their own reality. They think everyone knows what they 
know because they cannot model someone else’s mind and, 
in this case, realize that someone must see something in 
order to know it. [3점]

Humans rely heavily on communicating through the 
meaning found in words and the way they are arranged. We 
can tell someone we love them in a sad, happy, or soft 
tone of voice, which gives nuance to our feelings ― but the 
meaning of the words “I love you” remains the same. This 
is why “mixed signals” can be so confusing.    (A)   ,  
if a friend tells you that he or she likes you, you can 
interpret that in different ways, depending on the 
nonlanguage cues. If you hear “I like you” in a soft, upbeat 
tone and see your friend smiling and engaging you with 
friendly eye contact and body and arms relaxed, you will 
most likely believe that sentiment.    (B)   , if you hear 
“I like you” in an angry tone of voice while your friend 
exhibits no facial expression, avoids eye contact, and sits 
slightly turned away from you, with arms folded tightly, you 
would question his or her motive.
(A)     (B)
① For example …… As a result
② For example …… However
③ Otherwise …… However
④ In contrast …… As a result⑤ In contrast …… Furthermore

Have you ever done something absent­minded like throwing 
the peeled potato into the bin and the peelings into the pot? 
① How about sending an email saying there is a document 
attached without actually attaching the document?           
② Everyday mistakes like these happen all the time because 
our brains have to keep track of hundreds of different 
responses to thousands of different potential stimuli every 
hour of our waking lives. ③ Even though a second earlier we 
wrote that we were attaching a document to the email, the 
very next second our brain gives a command to our fingers 
to send the attachment­less email. ④ It is wise not to open 
email attachments from an unknown, doubtful, or 
untrustworthy source. ⑤ Sometimes we don’t even realize our 
mistake until we get an email from the addressee pointing it 
out.

Athletes often report that when they are doing well in 
their sport the size of the target looks incredibly large. 
(A) They had the players look at a poster with a variety 
of circles on it and asked them to indicate the circle 
they felt best represented the size of a softball. 
(B) They also collected from the players their “stats” from 
the game they had just completed so that the 
researchers could compute batting averages. They 
found those players who had better batting averages 
perceived the ball size as larger than those who had 
poorer ones.
(C) This is in contrast to the experience of the target 
looking incredibly small when the players are not 
doing well. To test this phenomenon, Jessica Witt and 
Dennis Proffitt recruited men and women softball 
players immediately after their games. [3점]

How can you tell the difference between a hard­boiled 
egg and a raw egg without breaking them? 
(A) When you take your finger away, the raw egg will 
continue to spin for a few more seconds, as the fluid 
inside is still moving. The hard­boiled egg will stop 
instantly.
(B) This is because the raw egg is fluid inside, whereas the 
hard­boiled egg is solid. When you spin the raw egg, 
the fluid inside moves around and causes the shaking. 
But the hard­boiled egg has no fluid like the raw egg, 
so it doesn’t shake. Put your finger briefly on the eggs 
to stop them spinning. 
(C) Spin both the eggs! You will find the hard­boiled egg 
spins so easily while the raw one doesn’t. Also, you 
will notice the raw egg will spin more slowly and it will 
shake!

Their commanding officer, relieved that his men had 
survived the snowstorm, asked how they made their way 
out.                   
M any years ago, a Hungarian military patrol was caught 
by a fierce snowstorm in the Swiss Alps. ( ① ) The 
soldiers were lost and frightened, but one of them found a 
map in his pocket. ( ② ) After consulting it, the soldiers 
built a shelter, planned their route, and then waited out the 
storm. ( ③ ) When the weather cleared three days later, 
they made their way back to the base camp. ( ④ )  
A young soldier showed the life­saving map to the officer, 
and he studied it carefully. ( ⑤ ) He was shocked to see 
that it was a map of the Pyrenees Mountains that border 
Spain and France, not the Swiss Alps.

However, they are unable to remember any of the words 
that they heard in the other ear, even if the same small 
set of words had been repeated a dozen times.
A classic psychological experiment asks a group of people 
to wear headphones. ( ① ) In this experiment, spoken 
words are played through the headphones, but a different 
set of words is played to each ear. ( ② ) Participants are 
told to listen to the words being sent to one ear (say the 
left ear) and to repeat them aloud. ( ③ ) When given 
these instructions, people are quite good at repeating the 
words that were spoken to that ear. ( ④ ) This example 
shows that much of the information that is available to your 
ears does not make it too far into your head. ( ⑤ ) You 
are selecting only a small amount of that information to be 
processed enough to know what words were being spoken.

As part of a research project, a group of undergraduate 
students watched a film, after which they were asked to 
describe it as fully as possible to other students. The 
listeners were actually research assistants, and for half 
the participants they assumed a positive listening style 
(smiling and nodding); for the other participants they 
assumed a negative listening style (frowning and 
unsmiling). Participants describing the film to positive 
listeners included more of their own opinions about what 
the film was trying to say. In contrast, participants 
speaking to negative listeners focused solely on objective 
facts and concrete details. The theory is that the smiles 
and nods of a listener signal interest and agreement, 
which in turn encourage the speaker to share more 
personal insights. Negative body language triggers a 
threat response that causes the speaker to pull back into 
the relative “safety” of facts.

(A)
Evan, a young medical student, had to be away from his 
fiancée for three years to study at college in New York, 
far away from his hometown, New Orleans. To be 
separated so long from his love was heart­breaking for 
him. He was eager to go see (a) her, but he was too poor 
to buy a ticket for a long­distance bus to his hometown. 
He was sad and depressed. He would go to the bus station 
just to watch the buses for New Orleans drive away while 
sitting on an old wooden bench. 
(B)
He showed the woman her picture. The woman said, “Oh, 
(b) she is the most beautiful young woman I’ve ever seen.” 
Then she began to tell him that she had been married to a 
traveling salesman who had recently passed away. She told 
him how they used to weep, both of them, each time he 
had to go away, but how happy they were when he 
returned. She said, “Marriage is wonderful. You’re going to 
have a wonderful marriage. Everything’s going to be fine.” 
Her words of kindness were a great comfort to him.
