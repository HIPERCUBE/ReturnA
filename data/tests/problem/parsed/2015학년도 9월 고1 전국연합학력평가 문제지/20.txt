20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Have you ever heard anyone say, “I had to carry the 
ball”? The expression “to carry the ball” means to take 
responsibility for getting something done. We use clichés 
like this every day in our speech. These expressions are 
colorful and often appealing in their economy and ability to 
convey an image or description of an emotion or situation. 
Someone may be “cold as ice” or “busy as a bee.” A story 
may be “too funny for words.” These expressions in speech 
do little harm. In writing, however, clichés suffer the fate 
of the familiar becoming boring. Your reader has heard and 
read these expressions so often that they tend to “bounce 
off” the reader so swiftly that they lose their appeal. 
Therefore, if you want your writing to be stronger and 
more effective, try not to use clichés. Clichés in writing 
ultimately diminish the strength and effectiveness of your 
message. 
* bounce off: ~을 맞고 튕겨나가다
