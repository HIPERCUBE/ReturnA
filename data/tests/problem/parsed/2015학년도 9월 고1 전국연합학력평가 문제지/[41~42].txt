Cultures have rarely been completely isolated from 
outside influence, because throughout human history people 
have been moving from one place to another, spreading 
goods and ideas. What is different today, though, is the 
speed and scope of these interactions. Several decades ago, 
overnight mail service and direct long­distance telephone 
calls increased the speed of cross­national communication. 
Advances in transportation technology have made 
international trade more cost­effective and international 
travel more accessible to ordinary citizens. Today the 
Internet has given people around the world immediate 
access to the cultural artifacts and ideals of other 
societies, no matter where they’re located. 
Clearly, societies are more interdependent than ever, and 
that matters for individuals. Sometimes the effects are 
positive. Medical discoveries in the United States or 
Europe, for instance, can save lives around the world. 
Globalization gives us a chance to learn about other 
societies and learn from them. Other times, however, 
global influence can have disastrous consequences. Many of 
today’s most urgent societal problems ― widespread 
environmental destruction, large­ and small­scale wars, 
economic crises, and so on ― are a function of globalization 
to some degree. 
In short, it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not 
impossible, to consider ourselves members of a single 
society           by other societies. All of us are 
members of our own society and citizens of a world 
community at the same time.
