Having watched the older children opening their gifts,     
I already knew that the big gifts were not necessarily the 
nicest ones. One girl my age got a large coloring book of 
historic characters, while a less greedy girl who selected a

into the sack, I quickly fingered the remaining presents, 
testing their weight, imagining what they contained. I chose 
a small but heavy one that was wrapped in shiny silver foil 
and a red ribbon. It was a pack of batteries, which was not 
a gift I wished for. I had nothing to use them with! So I 
spent the rest of the party watching the other kids enjoying 
their gifts.
