(A)
Evan, a young medical student, had to be away from his 
fiancée for three years to study at college in New York, 
far away from his hometown, New Orleans. To be 
separated so long from his love was heart­breaking for 
him. He was eager to go see (a) her, but he was too poor 
to buy a ticket for a long­distance bus to his hometown. 
He was sad and depressed. He would go to the bus station 
just to watch the buses for New Orleans drive away while 
sitting on an old wooden bench. 
(B)
He showed the woman her picture. The woman said, “Oh, 
(b) she is the most beautiful young woman I’ve ever seen.” 
Then she began to tell him that she had been married to a 
traveling salesman who had recently passed away. She told 
him how they used to weep, both of them, each time he 
had to go away, but how happy they were when he 
returned. She said, “Marriage is wonderful. You’re going to 
have a wonderful marriage. Everything’s going to be fine.” 
Her words of kindness were a great comfort to him.
