You’ve probably looked around you and noticed that all 
people are unique and different. Even people who might seem 
really similar in certain ways can also be very different. 
From different appearances, to different personalities, to 
different beliefs ― it’s a big world full of interesting and 
diverse people! It is tolerance that protects the diversity 
which makes the world so exciting. Tolerance is the idea that 
all people should be equally accepted and equally treated, 
regardless of their differences from others. It’s a lot like 
fairness. Having tolerance means giving every person the 
same consideration, despite a person’s opinions, background, 
appearance, or other qualities, and whether or not those 
things are the same as your own. Tolerance allows the world 
to flourish. That is why treating other people with tolerance 
is very important.
