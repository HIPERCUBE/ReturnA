However, they are unable to remember any of the words 
that they heard in the other ear, even if the same small 
set of words had been repeated a dozen times.
A classic psychological experiment asks a group of people 
to wear headphones. ( ① ) In this experiment, spoken 
words are played through the headphones, but a different 
set of words is played to each ear. ( ② ) Participants are 
told to listen to the words being sent to one ear (say the 
left ear) and to repeat them aloud. ( ③ ) When given 
these instructions, people are quite good at repeating the 
words that were spoken to that ear. ( ④ ) This example 
shows that much of the information that is available to your 
ears does not make it too far into your head. ( ⑤ ) You 
are selecting only a small amount of that information to be 
processed enough to know what words were being spoken.
