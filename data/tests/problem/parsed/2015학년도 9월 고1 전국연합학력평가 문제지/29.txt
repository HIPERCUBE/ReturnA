Though he probably was not the first to do it, Dutch 
eyeglass maker Hans Lippershey gets credit for putting two 
lenses on either end of a tube in 1608 and ① creating a 
“spyglass.” Even then, it was not Lippershey but his 
children who discovered ② that the double lenses made a 
nearby weathervane look bigger. These early instruments 
were not ③ much more than toys because their lenses were 
not very strong. The first person to turn a spyglass toward 
the sky was an Italian mathematician and professor  
named Galileo Galilei. Galileo, who heard about the Dutch 
spyglass and began making his own, ④ realizing right away 
how useful the device could be to armies and sailors. As he 
made better and better spyglasses, which were later named 
telescopes, Galileo decided ⑤ to point one at the Moon.
