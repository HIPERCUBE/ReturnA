Some species use alarm calls to share information about 
potential predators. Their alarm calls seem to convey very 
(A) specific / confusing  information about the nature of the 
predator that has been detected as they become more 
mature. When a young vervet monkey spots a bird in the 
sky above it, it will give an alarm call. In this case a sort 
of “cough­cough” noise. At this stage, the call appears to 
be an innate possible­danger­above signal because it is 
given as a response to any large flying object, dangerous 
or otherwise. But as the monkey matures, the range of 
stimuli that will trigger the call (B) broadens / narrows . 
Eventually the use of this alarm call will be restricted to 
those situations when an eagle is spotted in the skies 
above. Upon hearing the call the members of the group will 
scan the sky to locate the (C) prey / threat  and then make 
a dash for the cover provided by dense vegetation.
