32. To fight productivity­slowing energy burnout typical in 
offices during the day, a design firm in Amsterdam has 
recently introduced a new method for ensuring that its 
employees go home on time and rest. Every day promptly 
at 6 p.m., everyone’s desks are raised to the ceiling by iron 
cables, and the space is then transformed into either a 
dance floor or yoga studio open for free to the community. 
The creative director of the firm, Sander Veenendaal, stated 
that this new measure has not only improved workers’ lives, 
but helped to build up their brand as well.             is 
becoming a serious priority in offices around the world 
hoping to achieve similar results. [3점]
