(A)
Every weekend Billy’s parents give him $100 to spend. It 
all started when Billy wanted a really cool CD player. He 
asked his parents if they would buy it for (a) him and they 
said no. “But it’s only $100!” he complained. An hour later, 
his parents announced there would be a family meeting the 
next night at dinner. 
(B)
For Billy, one of those ways was to allow him to shop for 
the family. Each Saturday, Billy was to be given $100 ─
along with a shopping list of groceries for the family. It was 
up to (b) him to buy everything on the list. Whatever money 
was left over, whether two dollars or thirty, was Billy’s to 
keep and spend on what he wanted ─ whether for going to 
the movies, or for buying books.
(C)
They’d never had a family meeting before, so Billy and his 
brother Gabe were worried. “This must be really serious,” 
Gabe said when (c) he was alone with Billy in the living 
room. Billy said, “They’re going to make us do chores.” The 
next night, their parents opened the family meeting with the 
words, “We’ve been thinking about how to give you more say 
in our family.” They brought up a number of new ways 
(d) his brother and Billy could get involved.
(D)
Billy has been having more say in the family now for nearly 
two months, and his parents’ $100-a-week plan gives him 
real incentive to shop for the best bargains. Practically his 
whole lifestyle depends on it! Billy has learned to look for 
the best prices. Billy is still saving for his CD player ─ and 
he is also taking his cue from his parents and working on 
creative ways to get what (e) he wants.
