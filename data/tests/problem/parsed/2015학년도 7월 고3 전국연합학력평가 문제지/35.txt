D  e s p it e  all the increasingly user‒friendly and popular technology, most studies published since the early 1990s 
confirm earlier conclusions: paper still has advantages over 
screens as a reading medium. ① Together, laboratory 
experiments, polls, and consumer reports indicate that digital 
devices prevent people from efficiently navigating long texts, 
which may subtly inhibit reading comprehension. ② Compared 
with paper, screens may also drain more of our mental 
resources while we are reading and make it a little harder to 
remember what we read when we are done. ③ Whether they 
realize it or not, people often approach computers and tablets 
with a state of mind less beneficial to learning than the one 
they bring to paper. ④ They are favoring digital devices, as 
reading digital texts for facts and fun becomes more common. 
⑤ E‒readers also fail to recreate certain tactile experiences 
of reading on paper, the absence of which some find 
unsettling.
