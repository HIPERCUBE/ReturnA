In experientialism, the body is seen as playing a 
decisive role in producing the kind of mind we have. The 
mind is based on the body. In other words, the kind of 
body humans have influences the kind of mind they have. As a result, thought is taken to be embodied. 
(A) A tree is tall relative to our average human size. In 
this way, categories of mind are defined by the body’s 
interaction with the environment. We call such features 
of conceptual categories “interactional properties.”  
(B) As an example, take the conceptual category of TREE. 
How can the body play any role in our understanding 
what a tree is? For one thing, we understand a tree as 
being upright. 
(C) This comes from how we experience our own bodies; 
namely, that we experience ourselves as being erect. 
For another, we see a tree as tall. The aspect of 
tallness only makes sense with respect to our standard 
evaluation of the body’s relative height. [3점]
