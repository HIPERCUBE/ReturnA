20. Having positive relationships with peers can lead directly 
to resources and information that help students learn. By 
virtue of the fact that they are socially accepted, it is 
reasonable to assume that students who get along with their 
peers will also have access to peer resources that can 
promote the development of social and academic 
competencies. These resources can take the form of 
information and advice, modeled behavior, or specific 
experiences that facilitate learning. Teachers play the 
central pedagogical function of transmitting knowledge and 
training students in academic subject areas. However, 
students provide each other with valuable resources 
necessary to accomplish academic tasks. Students frequently 
clarify and interpret their teacher’s instructions concerning 
what they should be doing and how they should do it, 
provide mutual assistance in the form of volunteering 
substantive information and answering questions, and share 
various supplies such as pencils and paper.
