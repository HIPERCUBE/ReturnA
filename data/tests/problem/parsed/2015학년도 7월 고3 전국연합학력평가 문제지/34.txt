Once most Americans got their water only from the tap. 
Now they often buy their water in bottles. But bottled water 
costs 80 cents to $4.00 per gallon, while tap water costs only 
pennies per day. Is the extra expense worth it? Although the 
FDA sets regulations specifically for bottled water to ensure 
that it is safe, the Environmental Protection Agency’s 
standards for tap water are actually higher.     (A)    , 
bottled water is permitted to contain certain amounts of any 
bacteria. Tap water, in contrast, cannot contain any of the 
dangerous bacteria. Also, there are no federal filtration or 
disinfection requirements for bottled water, as there are for 
tap water. The chlorine used to treat tap water continues to 
kill harmful bacteria, while bottled water contains no such 
disinfectant to prevent bacterial growth.     (B)    , tap 
water is actually healthier in some respects. It usually 
contains fluoride, along with other minerals ― such as calcium 
and iron― that are beneficial to the body.
