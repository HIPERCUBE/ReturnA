32. Many political scientists used to assume that people vote 
selfishly, choosing the candidate or policy that will benefit 
them the most. But decades of research on public opinion 
have led to the conclusion that self‒interest is a weak 
predictor of policy preferences. Parents of children in public 
school are not more supportive of government aid to schools 
than other citizens, and young men subject to the draft are 
not more opposed to military escalation than men too old to 
be drafted. Rather, people care about their groups, whether 
those be racial, regional, or political. The political scientist 
Don Kinder summarizes the findings like this: “In matters of 
public opinion, citizens seem to be asking themselves not 
‘What’s in it for me?’ but rather ‘What’s in it for my 
group?’” Political opinions                            .

their cars showing the political causes, universities, and 
sports teams they support. Our politics is groupish, not 
selfish.
