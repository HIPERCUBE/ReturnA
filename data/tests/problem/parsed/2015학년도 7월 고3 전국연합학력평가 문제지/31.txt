31. Customers’ needs are usually expressed as high‒level 
descriptions of the overall quality of a product or service. 
They are typically stated as adjectives and inherently do not 
imply a specific benefit to the customer. For instance, 
customers commonly say they want a product or service to 
be “reliable,” “effective,” “robust,” “dependable,” or “resilient.” 
Razor users may want the product to be “durable and 
strong.” Although these simple statements provide some 
indication as to what customers are looking for, they have 
one major drawback. They are                             
and present designers, developers, and engineers with the 
impossible task of figuring out just what customers really 
mean by “durable” or “strong.” If engineers faced the task of 
making a razor more “durable,” would they try to make the 
blade last longer, resist bending, or withstand constant 
moisture? Would any of these actions satisfy the customer’s 
true measure of “durable?” [3점]
