23. Maximilian Ringelmann, a French engineer, studied the 
performance of horses in 1913. He concluded that the power 
of two animals pulling a coach did not equal twice the 
power of a single horse. Surprised by this result, he 
extended his research to humans. He had several men pull a 
rope and measured the force applied by each individual. On 
average, if two people were pulling together, each invested 
just 93 percent of his individual strength, when three pulled 
together, it was 85 percent, and with eight people, just 49 
percent. Science calls this the social loafing effect. It occurs 
when individual performance is not directly visible; it blends 
into the group effort. It occurs among rowers, but not in 
relay races, because here, individual contributions are 
evident. Social loafing is rational behavior: Why invest all of 
your energy when half will do ─ especially when this little 
shortcut goes unnoticed? Quite simply, social loafing is a 
form of cheating of which we are all guilty even if it takes 
place unconsciously, just as it does with the horses.
