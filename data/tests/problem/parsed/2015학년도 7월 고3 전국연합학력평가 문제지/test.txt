18. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Piglet was suffering from the very essence of worry. His 
mind was filled with all manner of possible horrors and 
disasters. “Supposing that...,” “What if...,” and their variants 
are the hallmark of worry and anxiety. “Supposing a tree 
fell down, Pooh, when we were underneath it?” Of course it 
is possible. All kinds of dreadful things could happen today 
or tomorrow. But most of them are very unlikely. Once you 
allow yourself to worry about the unlikely, there is no end 
to worrying. Imagine looking back on a life of worry about 
the unlikely. It would be a life spoiled by anxiety about 
things, the vast majority of which never happened. 
Whenever you catch yourself worrying that something 
dreadful might happen, answer the Piglet in yourself with 
Pooh’s reply: “Supposing it didn’t.” Tackling existing 
problems is quite enough; do not waste energy and 
happiness on problems which do not exist. 
① 일어날 것 같지 않은 일에 대해 걱정하지 마라.
② 불안을 해소하기 위해 근본적인 원인을 찾아라.          
③ 과거에 얽매이지 말고 현재에 충실해야 한다.
④ 적당한 긴장감을 유지하여 일의 효율성을 높여라.
⑤ 문제 해결을 위해 여러 사람의 의견을 경청해야 한다.
19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Both of us quiet, I put Lucy’s Mickey Mouse pajamas on 
her. Silent and somewhat still, she stood on the changing 
table as I held her close to zip her up. I breathed in the 
clean smell of her hair, feeling blonde curls tickle my chin. 
Suddenly, Lucy reached her arms around my neck, holding 
the back of my head tight between her arms. Little hands, 
little everything, pulled me to her, and she pressed her 
cheek to mine. It took only a moment to realize what was 
happening. “She’s hugging me for the very first time.” I 
wanted to yell for my husband, a neighbor, anyone to come 
see what my daughter was doing for the first time. We held 
each other for a few seconds, my daughter standing on the 
changing table dressed in her fuzzy red sleeper, her arms 
around my neck, her cheek pressed to my left shoulder. 
“Oh, Lucy,” I whispered, my words tight with tears. I never 
wanted to let go.
① lost and confused ② moved and delighted  
③ relaxed and relieved        ④ jealous and envious   
⑤ nervous and frightened

20. Having positive relationships with peers can lead directly 
to resources and information that help students learn. By 
virtue of the fact that they are socially accepted, it is 
reasonable to assume that students who get along with their 
peers will also have access to peer resources that can 
promote the development of social and academic 
competencies. These resources can take the form of 
information and advice, modeled behavior, or specific 
experiences that facilitate learning. Teachers play the 
central pedagogical function of transmitting knowledge and 
training students in academic subject areas. However, 
students provide each other with valuable resources 
necessary to accomplish academic tasks. Students frequently 
clarify and interpret their teacher’s instructions concerning 
what they should be doing and how they should do it, 
provide mutual assistance in the form of volunteering 
substantive information and answering questions, and share 
various supplies such as pencils and paper.
① ways to prevent conflict among peers
② benefits of positive peer relationships in learning     
③ side effects of strict school discipline on students
④ the importance of teachers’ detailed instructions 
⑤ necessary components of effective teaching
21. A business incubator is, quite simply, a building that is 
divided into units of space, which are then leased to early‒stage 
small businesses. The result is a collection of offices and small 
warehouses filled with businesses that have one thing in 
common: they are businesses in the early stages of 
development. Each of the businesses has problems and needs 
that are similar, and each is in need of a variety of help, 
ranging from technical assistance to shared business 
opportunities to a simple pat on the back. Business incubators 
are not intended to provide permanent homes to their client 
businesses but rather to provide them with a temporary 
nurturing environment, until such time as the business is 
financially healthy. Upon reaching more predictable profitability, 
the incubated business can then be expected to “graduate” and 
move on to a typical office or warehouse building.
① advantages of dividing labor
② the role of business incubators 
③ financial advice for incubated businesses
④ how to make profits in a competitive market
⑤ the early‒stage obstacles to small businesses

22. We have seen that individuals in many species are more 
likely to behave in an altruistic way when close relatives or 
kin will benefit than when only non‒relatives will gain. This 
suggests that they can recognize which members of their 
species are kin and which are not. How does this occur? A 
key point is that individuals are by no means always 
accurate on this issue. For example, there are several 
species of birds in which the parents will ignore their own 
offspring if they are put outside their nest. However, if a 
cuckoo or other bird deposits an egg inside their nest, they 
will look after the bird when it hatches as if it were their 
own. These observations suggest that individuals tend to 
regard any other animal living in their home as kin even if 
there is no close physical resemblance. [3점] 
① Why Altruism Influences the Social Behavior of Birds
② Nest Defence Is the Top Priority of Parent Birds
③ Recognizing Relatives Is the Key to Survival
④ Hatching Eggs: A Symbol of Aspiration
⑤ Kin Recognition: Is It Always Precise?
23. Maximilian Ringelmann, a French engineer, studied the 
performance of horses in 1913. He concluded that the power 
of two animals pulling a coach did not equal twice the 
power of a single horse. Surprised by this result, he 
extended his research to humans. He had several men pull a 
rope and measured the force applied by each individual. On 
average, if two people were pulling together, each invested 
just 93 percent of his individual strength, when three pulled 
together, it was 85 percent, and with eight people, just 49 
percent. Science calls this the social loafing effect. It occurs 
when individual performance is not directly visible; it blends 
into the group effort. It occurs among rowers, but not in 
relay races, because here, individual contributions are 
evident. Social loafing is rational behavior: Why invest all of 
your energy when half will do ─ especially when this little 
shortcut goes unnoticed? Quite simply, social loafing is a 
form of cheating of which we are all guilty even if it takes 
place unconsciously, just as it does with the horses.
① Why Teams Are Lazy
② How Cooperation Maximizes Efficiency
③ Where Individual Capability Stands Out
④ Group Competitions Make People More Alert
⑤ Social Loafing: Booster of Individual Performance
24. Jeannette Rankin에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Jeannette Rankin was born in Missoula, Montana in 1880. 
After attending public schools in Missoula, Jeannette 
majored in biology at the University of Montana and 
graduated in 1902. Jeannette became the first woman 
elected to the U.S. Congress in 1916, before women 
nationwide had the right to vote. In 1917, she became one 
of 49 members of Congress who voted against entry into 
World War I. In 1941, she was the only legislator to vote 
against entry into World War II. The vote effectively ended 
her political career. In 1943, Jeannette went back to 
Montana rather than run for Congress again. She traveled 
worldwide, including to India and Turkey, promoting peace. 
Her long career was distinguished by her deep commitment 
to the country’s women, poor, and children. She continued 
to participate in antiwar movements actively by attending 
rallies and giving speeches into her 90’s.
① 대학에서 생물학을 전공했다.
② 미국에서 국회의원으로 선출된 최초의 여성이었다.

⑤ 90대의 나이까지 반전운동에 참가했다.

The above graph shows the total U.S. primary energy 
production in 2011 and the percentage each energy source 
accounts for. ① The pie chart shows five different energy 
sources: natural gas, coal, petroleum, nuclear, and 
renewables, with the last of these divided into six further 
sub‒categories. ② The percentage of natural gas, coal, and 
petroleum in total takes up more than two thirds of the total 
U.S. primary energy production. ③ The data also reveals that 
nuclear power generation ranks last and is close behind 
renewables with a marginal difference of one percentage 
point. ④ In the category of renewable energy, biofuels and 
other biomass percentages combined are larger than half of 
the renewable energy produced while hydroelectric energy is 
the single largest source. ⑤ Meanwhile, the two lowest 
renewables, geothermal and solar, share the same percentage 
of two percent each.


33. In a study of complimenting behavior in American English, 
researchers discovered that one of the most striking 
features of compliments in American English is  
. An initial examination of a 
large corpus revealed surprising repetitiveness in both the 
object of the compliments and the lexical items used to 
describe them. On closer investigation, it was discovered 
that regularities exist on all levels and that compliments are 
in fact formulas. We may categorize 80% of all compliments 
in the data as adjectival in that they depend on an adjective 
for their positive semantic value. In all, some seventy‒two 
positive adjectives occur in the data. What is striking, 
however, is that of these seventy‒two adjectives only five 
(nice, good, beautiful, pretty and great) are used with any 
frequency. While most adjectives occur only once or twice 
in the data, these five adjectives occur with such frequency 
that of all adjectival compliments in the corpus two thirds 
make use of only five adjectives. [3점]

Once most Americans got their water only from the tap. 
Now they often buy their water in bottles. But bottled water 
costs 80 cents to $4.00 per gallon, while tap water costs only 
pennies per day. Is the extra expense worth it? Although the 
FDA sets regulations specifically for bottled water to ensure 
that it is safe, the Environmental Protection Agency’s 
standards for tap water are actually higher.     (A)    , 
bottled water is permitted to contain certain amounts of any 
bacteria. Tap water, in contrast, cannot contain any of the 
dangerous bacteria. Also, there are no federal filtration or 
disinfection requirements for bottled water, as there are for 
tap water. The chlorine used to treat tap water continues to 
kill harmful bacteria, while bottled water contains no such 
disinfectant to prevent bacterial growth.     (B)    , tap 
water is actually healthier in some respects. It usually 
contains fluoride, along with other minerals ― such as calcium 
and iron― that are beneficial to the body.

D  e s p it e  all the increasingly user‒friendly and popular technology, most studies published since the early 1990s 
confirm earlier conclusions: paper still has advantages over 
screens as a reading medium. ① Together, laboratory 
experiments, polls, and consumer reports indicate that digital 
devices prevent people from efficiently navigating long texts, 
which may subtly inhibit reading comprehension. ② Compared 
with paper, screens may also drain more of our mental 
resources while we are reading and make it a little harder to 
remember what we read when we are done. ③ Whether they 
realize it or not, people often approach computers and tablets 
with a state of mind less beneficial to learning than the one 
they bring to paper. ④ They are favoring digital devices, as 
reading digital texts for facts and fun becomes more common. 
⑤ E‒readers also fail to recreate certain tactile experiences 
of reading on paper, the absence of which some find 
unsettling.

In experientialism, the body is seen as playing a 
decisive role in producing the kind of mind we have. The 
mind is based on the body. In other words, the kind of 
body humans have influences the kind of mind they have. As a result, thought is taken to be embodied. 
(A) A tree is tall relative to our average human size. In 
this way, categories of mind are defined by the body’s 
interaction with the environment. We call such features 
of conceptual categories “interactional properties.”  
(B) As an example, take the conceptual category of TREE. 
How can the body play any role in our understanding 
what a tree is? For one thing, we understand a tree as 
being upright. 
(C) This comes from how we experience our own bodies; 
namely, that we experience ourselves as being erect. 
For another, we see a tree as tall. The aspect of 
tallness only makes sense with respect to our standard 
evaluation of the body’s relative height. [3점]

Using emotional language is a way to get your audience 
not only to understand your argument but also to feel it. 
(A) Probably folks might like the idea of that, but they 
won’t necessarily bother to leave the house to go vote 
for it. People don’t care about traffic unless they are 
stuck in it and missing their children’s soccer practice. 
(B) A few years ago I was involved in a campaign for a bill 
to fund an extra lane for a local freeway. The county 
wanted to run promotional ads for the bill promising to 
“improve our roads” and “reduce commute time.” 
(C) A better approach was to run ads asking, “Wouldn’t it 
be nice to get to your child’s practice on time for 
once?” or, “Wouldn’t you like to get home early enough 
to have dinner with your family every night?” That 
helped voters picture exactly how the expanded 
freeway would improve their lives.

Looking at nature is another activity that gives our 
directed attention a chance to recover.  
“We have two kinds of attention,” says Andrea Faber 
Taylor, an environmental psychologist at the University of 
Illinois. The first is the “directed attention” we call on for 
tasks that require focus, like driving or doing our taxes.  
( ① ) Directed attention tends to be tiring, however, and 
fatigue affects our ability to make good decisions and 
control destructive impulses. ( ② ) The best way to restore 
directed attention is to give it a rest by shifting to the 
second type, “involuntary attention,” which we display when 
we meditate. ( ③ ) For example, Roger Ulrich at Texas A&M 
University found that people who commuted along scenic 
roads recovered more quickly from stressful driving 
conditions than those who saw billboards, buildings, and 
parking lots. ( ④ ) Ulrich also looked at patients recovering 
from surgery. ( ⑤ ) The patients who could see trees from 
their hospital beds needed fewer painkillers and had shorter 
hospital stays than those who looked out on brick walls.
39. 
Courbet broke with this tradition and provided art history 
with its first public scandal with the painting “Burial at 
Ornans.”  
Parallel to new trends in the natural sciences and 
humanities, the realists focused on fact and perception, 
thus rejecting art that was based only on imaginary worlds. 
( ① ) However, they never sought to simply imitate reality 
since that would have been easier with photography, which 
had just recently been invented. ( ② ) Instead, painters like 
Gustave Courbet, Adolf von Menzel, Jean‒François Millet, and 
Honoré Daumier wanted to illustrate social conditions within 
their art. ( ③ ) In particular, artists chose motifs taken from 
industrial and rural worlds of life and labor. ( ④ ) Previously, 
these subjects had been handled at most in small, anecdotal 
genre paintings. ( ⑤ ) It portrayed an ordinary funeral and the 
rural mourners on a monumental scale, challenging the accepted 
norms of the art establishment at that time.

New York University psychologist Gabriele Oettingen 
studied women enrolled in a weight‒reduction program 
trying to lose a few pounds. In the study, the 
participants used positive thinking ― imagining themselves 
reaching their goals ― as a motivator. The results weren’t 
so positive. “A year later, I checked in on these women 
from the weight‒loss study,” Oettingen writes in the New 
York Times, and “the more positively women had 
imagined themselves in these scenarios, the fewer pounds 
they had lost.” As the above study and others of 
Oettingen’s found, positive thinking makes people feel 
comfortable with their present state. Too comfortable. 
Dreaming of the future “can drain you of the energy you 
need to take action in pursuit of your goals,” she says.   “Positive thinking fools our minds into perceiving that 
we’ve already attained our goal, slackening our readiness 
to pursue it.”

Linda was planning to visit Amy in a distant city, but 
shortly before she was supposed to arrive, Linda called 
and canceled. Although Amy felt disappointed, she tried to 
be understanding. Being polite by not imposing, and 
respecting Linda’s need for independence, Amy said it was 
really okay if Linda didn’t come. Linda was very 
depressed at that time, and she got more depressed. She 
took Amy’s considerateness as indifference. Amy later felt 
partly responsible for Linda’s depression because she 
hadn’t insisted that Linda visit. This confusion was easy 
to fall into and hard to climb out of because ways of 
showing caring and indifference are inherently ambiguous. 
You can be nice to someone either by showing your 
involvement or by not imposing. And you can be mean by 
refusing to show involvement ― cutting her off ― or by 
imposing ― being “inconsiderate.” You can show someone 
you are angry by shouting at her or refusing to talk to 
her at all. You can be kind by saying something or by 
saying nothing. For example, if someone has suffered a 
misfortune ― failed an exam, lost a job, or contracted a 
disease ― you may show sympathy by expressing your 
concern in words or by deliberately not mentioning it to 
avoid causing pain by bringing it up. If everyone takes the 
latter approach,              becomes a chamber in which 
the ill, the bereaved and the unemployed are isolated.

(A)
The little country schoolhouse was heated by an old‒
fashioned coal stove. An eight‒year‒old boy named Glenn 
and (a) his older brother had the job of coming to school 
early each day so that they could use kerosene to start the 
fire and warm the classroom. One cold morning someone 
mistakenly filled the kerosene container they used with 
gasoline, and disaster struck. The fire killed Glenn’s brother 
and badly burned Glenn’s legs.               * kerosene: 등유
 (B)
For two months, the parents and the doctor debated on 
whether to amputate. They used this time to instill in Glenn 
the belief that (b) he would someday walk again. They never 
amputated Glenn’s legs, but when the bandages were finally 
removed, it was discovered that his right leg was almost 
three inches shorter than the other. The toes on his left foot 
were almost completely burned off. Yet Glenn was fiercely 
determined. Though in unbearable pain, he forced himself to 
exercise daily and finally took a few painful steps.          
** amputate: (손이나 발을) 절단하다
(C)
Slowly recovering, Glenn finally threw away his crutches 
and began to walk almost normally. Soon he was running. 
This determined young man kept running and running and 
running― and those legs that came so close to being 
amputated carried (c) him to a world record in the mile run. 
His full name? Glenn Cunningham, who was known as the 
“World’s Fastest Human Being,” and was named athlete of 
the century at Madison Square Garden.  
(D)
The doctor attending Glenn recommended amputating his 
legs. His parents were devastated. They had already lost 
one son, and now their other son was to lose (d) his legs. 
However, they did not lose their faith. They did not 
consent to what the doctor suggested, either. Each day they 
asked (e) him for a delay, praying that their son’s legs 
would somehow heal and he would become well again.
