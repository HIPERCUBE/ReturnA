Using emotional language is a way to get your audience 
not only to understand your argument but also to feel it. 
(A) Probably folks might like the idea of that, but they 
won’t necessarily bother to leave the house to go vote 
for it. People don’t care about traffic unless they are 
stuck in it and missing their children’s soccer practice. 
(B) A few years ago I was involved in a campaign for a bill 
to fund an extra lane for a local freeway. The county 
wanted to run promotional ads for the bill promising to 
“improve our roads” and “reduce commute time.” 
(C) A better approach was to run ads asking, “Wouldn’t it 
be nice to get to your child’s practice on time for 
once?” or, “Wouldn’t you like to get home early enough 
to have dinner with your family every night?” That 
helped voters picture exactly how the expanded 
freeway would improve their lives.
