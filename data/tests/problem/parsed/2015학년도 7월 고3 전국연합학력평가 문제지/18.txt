Piglet was suffering from the very essence of worry. His 
mind was filled with all manner of possible horrors and 
disasters. “Supposing that...,” “What if...,” and their variants 
are the hallmark of worry and anxiety. “Supposing a tree 
fell down, Pooh, when we were underneath it?” Of course it 
is possible. All kinds of dreadful things could happen today 
or tomorrow. But most of them are very unlikely. Once you 
allow yourself to worry about the unlikely, there is no end 
to worrying. Imagine looking back on a life of worry about 
the unlikely. It would be a life spoiled by anxiety about 
things, the vast majority of which never happened. 
Whenever you catch yourself worrying that something 
dreadful might happen, answer the Piglet in yourself with 
Pooh’s reply: “Supposing it didn’t.” Tackling existing 
problems is quite enough; do not waste energy and 
happiness on problems which do not exist.
