29. 밑줄 친 he가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
According to Dr. Paul Ekman, a pioneer of lying research at 
UC San Francisco, here is an example of how difficult it is 
for children to grasp the qualifying role of intent in telling a 
lie. On the way home from school on Tuesday, a dad 
promises his five‒year‒old son that ① he will take him to the 
baseball game on Saturday afternoon. When they get home, 
Dad learns from Mom that earlier in the day she had 
scheduled a swim lesson for Saturday afternoon and can’t 
change it. When they tell their son, ② he gets terribly upset, 
and the situation melts down. Why is the kid so upset? Dad 
didn’t know about the swim lesson. By the adult definition, 
③ he did not lie. But by the kid definition, ④ he did lie. Any 
false statement ― regardless of intent or belief ― is a lie. 
Therefore, unwittingly, Dad has given his child the message 
that ⑤ he approves of breaking promises.
