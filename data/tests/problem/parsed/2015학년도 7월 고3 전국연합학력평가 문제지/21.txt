21. A business incubator is, quite simply, a building that is 
divided into units of space, which are then leased to early‒stage 
small businesses. The result is a collection of offices and small 
warehouses filled with businesses that have one thing in 
common: they are businesses in the early stages of 
development. Each of the businesses has problems and needs 
that are similar, and each is in need of a variety of help, 
ranging from technical assistance to shared business 
opportunities to a simple pat on the back. Business incubators 
are not intended to provide permanent homes to their client 
businesses but rather to provide them with a temporary 
nurturing environment, until such time as the business is 
financially healthy. Upon reaching more predictable profitability, 
the incubated business can then be expected to “graduate” and 
move on to a typical office or warehouse building.
