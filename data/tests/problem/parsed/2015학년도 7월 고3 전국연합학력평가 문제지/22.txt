22. We have seen that individuals in many species are more 
likely to behave in an altruistic way when close relatives or 
kin will benefit than when only non‒relatives will gain. This 
suggests that they can recognize which members of their 
species are kin and which are not. How does this occur? A 
key point is that individuals are by no means always 
accurate on this issue. For example, there are several 
species of birds in which the parents will ignore their own 
offspring if they are put outside their nest. However, if a 
cuckoo or other bird deposits an egg inside their nest, they 
will look after the bird when it hatches as if it were their 
own. These observations suggest that individuals tend to 
regard any other animal living in their home as kin even if 
there is no close physical resemblance. [3점]
