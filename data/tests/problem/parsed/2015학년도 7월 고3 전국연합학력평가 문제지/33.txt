33. In a study of complimenting behavior in American English, 
researchers discovered that one of the most striking 
features of compliments in American English is  
. An initial examination of a 
large corpus revealed surprising repetitiveness in both the 
object of the compliments and the lexical items used to 
describe them. On closer investigation, it was discovered 
that regularities exist on all levels and that compliments are 
in fact formulas. We may categorize 80% of all compliments 
in the data as adjectival in that they depend on an adjective 
for their positive semantic value. In all, some seventy‒two 
positive adjectives occur in the data. What is striking, 
however, is that of these seventy‒two adjectives only five 
(nice, good, beautiful, pretty and great) are used with any 
frequency. While most adjectives occur only once or twice 
in the data, these five adjectives occur with such frequency 
that of all adjectival compliments in the corpus two thirds 
make use of only five adjectives. [3점]
