Are you a forgetful student? Do you often experience
headaches? Then perhaps you just need to increase your
water intake to revive your brain function. It is known that
85% of our brain tissue is water. Hence, water is a vital
component for the smooth function of our brain. And
according to research, if a person’s body is short of water,
his brain releases a hormone called cortisol that has a
shrinkage effect to the brain, which then decreases its
memory power. Inadequate water in the brain is also the
culprit of being forgetful, restless and slow. Headaches are
also more frequent when our brain lacks water. So never
ever let yourself get thirsty because you are making your
brain shrink, become restless and forgetful.
