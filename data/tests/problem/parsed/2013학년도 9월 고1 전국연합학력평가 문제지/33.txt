33. As parents of multiple children know, there is no one
simple formula for meeting a baby’s needs. From birth,
each baby has a unique personality and preferences. Each
baby’s nervous system is unique as well. Some babies
might be calmed by noise and activity whereas others
might prefer quiet. The key is to learn what your baby
needs and respond to them accordingly. Even though all of
the sounds and cries may sound the same at first, your
baby is communicating with you in different ways, using

communicate something specific about your baby’s emotional
and physical state. Your task is to become a(n) “ ”
and find out what your baby is communicating and how best
to respond. [3점]
