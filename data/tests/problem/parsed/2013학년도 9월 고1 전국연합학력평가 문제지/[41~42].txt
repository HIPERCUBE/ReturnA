Imagine for a moment a group of cave people highlighted
in firelight, watching a woman scratch images onto a cave
wall. When she finishes, the woman joins her friends around
the fire and begins to tell an amazing story, her face
enhanced by the glowing orange light as she gestures at her
artwork. Her audience smiles and nods, their eyes wide and
curious. They are inspired by the woman’s words and
pictures. And the woman, encouraged by their responses,
feels proud of her work.
What was taking place in that cave? The woman was
sharing her way of seeing life and the world with her peers
for their consideration and enjoyment. Since the beginning
of time, creative people have sought out an audience, and
we’re no different today. We need to share our creations
with someone and have our work in order to feel
as if it’s worthwhile. It’s as simple as that.
An age­old question is applicable here: If a tree falls in
the forest and no one hears it, is there still a sound? The
responses of others bring value to your mode of
self­expression, be it photography, writing, painting,
scrapbooking, or baking.
