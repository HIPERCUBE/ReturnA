Last Memorial Day I was invited to my cousin’s house for
a barbecue. The last thing I wanted to do was spend hours
in traffic. So I decided to take a different route; I traveled
the back roads instead of the highway. My family and I
enjoyed the scenery, and there was hardly any traffic. A
simple change in route changed our whole day. When we do
the same old thing, the same old way for too long, we
become bored, and boredom fosters bad attitudes. Try
something new at least once a day. It doesn’t have to be
anything major. Even a small disruption in the routine can
create a fresh approach and a new way of looking at things.
