Simon was a high school graduate who was not good at
grammar. His brother, Robert, enjoyed pointing out the
errors in Simon’s e­mails. Simon knew that his brother was
very “book smart,” but didn’t think ① he was “street smart.”
One day, Robert bought stereo speakers from a street seller.
As soon as ② he arrived home, he called Simon over to help
set up the speakers. He was excited because he had bought
the speakers at half price. But ③ he was disappointed and
angry when he discovered that the boxes contained only old
magazines. Simon smiled and asked him if ④ he got a
receipt and heard of the return policy. Then ⑤he asked,
“Did the seller tell you where his ‘store’ is going to be
tomorrow?”
