34. Jupiter is here . In the
early hours of September 10, an astronomer in Oregon
spotted a bright flash of light on Jupiter. Astronomers
believe this brilliant burst to be an asteroid hitting the giant
planet. Scientists say that the asteroid may have been
heading for Earth, but instead, Jupiter took the blow. And
this may not be the first time Jupiter has saved Earth from
being hit. Jupiter has the strongest gravitational pull of any
planet. The gravitational pull of Jupiter grabs passing
asteroids and pulls them to its surface― and away from
Earth. The impacts are leading scientists to study possible
marks from asteroids on Jupiter. Chances of actually hitting
Earth are very unlikely, but scientists keep a close watch on
asteroids as there are so many of them in orbit.
