Studying families with rare genetic disorders has allowed
doctors to trace the genetic basis of disease through
generations.
Promising advances have been made in the area of human
genetics. ( ① ) In the 1980s, scientists developed methods to
compare the DNA sequence of different individuals. ( ② )
DNA left behind at the scene of a crime has been used as
evidence in court, both to prosecute criminals and to set
free people who have been wrongly accused. ( ③ ) DNA
sequencing techniques are also useful in the field of
medicine. ( ④ ) This kind of genetic tracking helps doctors
to predict the likelihood of a person getting a disease and to
diagnose it ― although not to cure the illness. ( ⑤ )
However, some genetic diseases can now be treated by
replacing damaged genes with healthy ones, a practice called
gene therapy.
