Lots of media reports claim that breakfast is the most
important out of the three meals of the day. According to
them, we should have the most glamorous meal for breakfast
and limit food intake as day passes by. This is because,
they say, breakfast provides essential energy to both your
body and brain throughout the day. (A) , I view that
this argument has a risk of underestimating the worth of
lunch and dinner. Having a grand breakfast is not a
one­size­fits­all rule that applies to everyone. People’s
lifestyles and constitutions differ from one another. Lunch
and dinner can also give quality energy to people all around
the day just like breakfast. (B) , it is rather what kind
of food people eat for each meal than just increasing the
volume of breakfast that plays a more significant role in
improving one’s health.
