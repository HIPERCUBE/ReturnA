36. Teachers at Stone Mountain State College (S.M.S.C.) give
higher grades than teachers at other colleges in the state
college system. More than one­third of the undergraduate
grades awarded in the spring semester 2005 were A’s, and
only 1.1 percent were F’s. The percentage of A’s awarded to
graduate students was even higher; almost two­thirds were
A’s. The students, of course, may be happy because they
received high grades. However, evidence suggests that this
trend is . When they
applied to a graduate or professional school, they got
disadvantages because the admission offices believed an A from
S.M.S.C. is not equal to an A from other universities. Grade
inflation, therefore, may hurt a student from S.M.S.C. who
intends to apply to a graduate or professional school. [3점]
