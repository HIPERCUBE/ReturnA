23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Last Memorial Day I was invited to my cousin’s house for
a barbecue. The last thing I wanted to do was spend hours
in traffic. So I decided to take a different route; I traveled
the back roads instead of the highway. My family and I
enjoyed the scenery, and there was hardly any traffic. A
simple change in route changed our whole day. When we do
the same old thing, the same old way for too long, we
become bored, and boredom fosters bad attitudes. Try
something new at least once a day. It doesn’t have to be
anything major. Even a small disruption in the routine can
create a fresh approach and a new way of looking at things.
① 일상에서 새로운 것을 시도하라.
② 긍정적인 태도로 대화에 임하라.

⑤ 예상하지 못한 변화에 적극적으로 대처하라.
24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each
morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day
with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the
worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.
Your “frog” is your biggest, most important task. It is also
the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on
your life and results at the moment. If you have many
important tasks before you, start with the biggest, hardest,
and most important task first. Discipline yourself to begin
immediately and then persist until the task is complete
before you go on to something else.
① 체계적인 훈련을 통해 좋은 습관이 형성된다.
② 차선책 마련은 최악의 상황을 대비할 수 있다.
③ 구체적인 계획 수립이 일의 능률을 향상시킨다.
④ 가장 중요한 일부터 시작하는 것이 바람직하다.
⑤ 협동은 어려운 문제를 해결하는 효과적인 수단이다.
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Are you a forgetful student? Do you often experience
headaches? Then perhaps you just need to increase your
water intake to revive your brain function. It is known that
85% of our brain tissue is water. Hence, water is a vital
component for the smooth function of our brain. And
according to research, if a person’s body is short of water,
his brain releases a hormone called cortisol that has a
shrinkage effect to the brain, which then decreases its
memory power. Inadequate water in the brain is also the
culprit of being forgetful, restless and slow. Headaches are
also more frequent when our brain lacks water. So never
ever let yourself get thirsty because you are making your
brain shrink, become restless and forgetful.
*culprit: 장본인
① No Water Before Meals
② Save Water, Save Yourself
③ What Makes Your Brain Bigger?
④ Does Your Brain Get Enough Water?
⑤ Headaches: the First Sign of Forgetfulness
26. 밑줄 친 he가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Simon was a high school graduate who was not good at
grammar. His brother, Robert, enjoyed pointing out the
errors in Simon’s e­mails. Simon knew that his brother was
very “book smart,” but didn’t think ① he was “street smart.”
One day, Robert bought stereo speakers from a street seller.
As soon as ② he arrived home, he called Simon over to help
set up the speakers. He was excited because he had bought
the speakers at half price. But ③ he was disappointed and
angry when he discovered that the boxes contained only old
magazines. Simon smiled and asked him if ④ he got a
receipt and heard of the return policy. Then ⑤he asked,
“Did the seller tell you where his ‘store’ is going to be
tomorrow?”
27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Grateful people are inclined to make healthy decisions. Life
and sports present many situations ①where critical and
difficult decisions have to be made. Selfish adults or kids do
not make sound decisions as well as ②are grateful people.
This includes the decision to be self­motivated. Frustrated
parents ask: “How do I motivate my child to do sports or
continue in sports? Sometimes my child gets ③discouraged
and does not want to put the required effort into his or her
sports? What can I, as a parent, do or say to help?” It is
difficult and almost impossible ④ to motivate kids or adults
who are centered on their own narrow selfish desires.
However, kids and adults who live as grateful people are
able to motivate ⑤ themselves. They also welcome
suggestions from others, even parents.
28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지
않은 것은? [3점]
Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably
intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest
people in them. Even if most of the people within a
group are not especially well­informed or rational, it can
still reach a ① collectively wise decision. This is a good
thing, since human beings are not perfectly designed
decision makers. We generally have less information than
we’d like. We have ② sufficient foresight into the future.
Instead of insisting on finding the best possible decision,
we will often ③ accept one that seems good enough. And
we often let emotion affect our ④ judgement. Yet despite
all these limitations, when our imperfect opinions are
gathered in the right way, our collective intelligence is
often ⑤ excellent.
29. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?

transportation in Korea that passengers used in 2001 and

preferred means of passenger transportation. ②However,
the percentage of cars used in 2010 was less than in 2001.
③ Compared to 2001, four means of transportation showed
increased percentages in 2010. ④ In 2001 trains were the
third preferred means of transportation, followed by
airplanes and ships. ⑤Ships in 2010 accounted for the
same percentage as in 2001.
30. American Coots에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The American Coots are dark, duck­like birds. They are
recognized by their chicken­like white bill, red eyes, and
small red spot at the top of their bill. They are good
swimmers and spend much of their lives floating on open
water. American Coots build floating nests in wetlands or
shallow lakes. The female lays 9 to 12 eggs, light with
brown spots. Both parents sit on the eggs and feed the
young. They eat a variety of food such as insects and
plants. They migrate from August to December, with males
moving south before the females and their babies. They are
not very good at taking off in flight. When they try to
launch themselves, they have to run along the surface of the
water for a while. *bill: 부리
① 빨간 눈을 가지고 있다.
② 습지에 떠있는 둥지를 짓는다.
③ 암컷과 수컷이 모두 알을 품는다.
④ 곤충과 식물을 먹는다.
⑤ 수컷이 먼저 북쪽으로 이동한다.


35. Psychologists distinguish between two types of stress:
good stress, called eustress, and bad stress, called
distress. Many people would probably be surprised that
stress can benefit you and your body, but that is exactly
what eustress does. This is not only good for you; it is
actually designed .
When humans encounter a dangerous circumstance, their
breathing becomes faster, their heart rate increases, and
their throat and nose muscles open up to allow more air to
get to the lungs. This physical reaction prepares the body
either to fight the danger or to escape it. For example, if
you were alone on the street and encountered a stranger
late at night, your body might prepare your heart and lungs
to help you run away as quickly as possible from the
danger. Without eustress, you would never get this head
start.
① to help you survive from danger
② to lower your risk of depression
③ to protect you from hormone imbalance
④ to make runners get better records
⑤ to fight off dangerous diseases
36. Teachers at Stone Mountain State College (S.M.S.C.) give
higher grades than teachers at other colleges in the state
college system. More than one­third of the undergraduate
grades awarded in the spring semester 2005 were A’s, and
only 1.1 percent were F’s. The percentage of A’s awarded to
graduate students was even higher; almost two­thirds were
A’s. The students, of course, may be happy because they
received high grades. However, evidence suggests that this
trend is . When they
applied to a graduate or professional school, they got
disadvantages because the admission offices believed an A from
S.M.S.C. is not equal to an A from other universities. Grade
inflation, therefore, may hurt a student from S.M.S.C. who
intends to apply to a graduate or professional school. [3점]
① decreasing the quality of higher education
② causing students to neglect their studies
③ attracting more foreign students
④ having negative consequences
⑤ spreading to other states
37. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
Lots of media reports claim that breakfast is the most
important out of the three meals of the day. According to
them, we should have the most glamorous meal for breakfast
and limit food intake as day passes by. This is because,
they say, breakfast provides essential energy to both your
body and brain throughout the day. (A) , I view that
this argument has a risk of underestimating the worth of
lunch and dinner. Having a grand breakfast is not a
one­size­fits­all rule that applies to everyone. People’s
lifestyles and constitutions differ from one another. Lunch
and dinner can also give quality energy to people all around
the day just like breakfast. (B) , it is rather what kind
of food people eat for each meal than just increasing the
volume of breakfast that plays a more significant role in
improving one’s health.
(A) (B)
① However …… Similarly
② However …… Therefore
③ In contrast …… Nevertheless
④ For example …… Similarly
⑤ For example …… Therefore

Blinking is an involuntary action that protects the eye.
When the eyes are open, one­tenth of the total surface
area is exposed to the atmosphere.
(A) That is the physiological reason behind blinking, but we
blink for psychological reasons as well. For instance,
nervousness, loud noises, stress and tension affect the
number of times we blink.
(B) They blink. Blinking makes the eyes wet and keeps the
front portion clear for good vision. When we blink, a
film of tears covers the eyes and washes all the tiny
dust particles that may be present.
(C) This means the eye, the most delicate and sensitive
part of the body, has to withstand the dust present in
the air. So, what do the eyes do as a safeguard
mechanism?

Studying families with rare genetic disorders has allowed
doctors to trace the genetic basis of disease through
generations.
Promising advances have been made in the area of human
genetics. ( ① ) In the 1980s, scientists developed methods to
compare the DNA sequence of different individuals. ( ② )
DNA left behind at the scene of a crime has been used as
evidence in court, both to prosecute criminals and to set
free people who have been wrongly accused. ( ③ ) DNA
sequencing techniques are also useful in the field of
medicine. ( ④ ) This kind of genetic tracking helps doctors
to predict the likelihood of a person getting a disease and to
diagnose it ― although not to cure the illness. ( ⑤ )
However, some genetic diseases can now be treated by
replacing damaged genes with healthy ones, a practice called
gene therapy.

“Humans, like most animals, have a strong preference
for immediate reward over delayed reward. If you offer
me $10 today or $11 tomorrow, I’ll probably say I’d
rather have the $10 today,” says Zweig. Even bigger
numbers don’t seem to make a difference. Financial
experts like me routinely use what­if scenarios to try to
encourage people to save more and at a younger age.
You’ve heard us say that if at age 20, you put aside
$100 a month earning 8 percent interest, you’d have
$525,454 at retirement. If you waited until you were 30
to begin, you’d have only $229,388. Yes, the examples
are striking, but by Zweig’s logic, they probably aren’t
very effective. “A reward you get in the distant future
has no emotional kick to it. It’s just a possible outcome,”
he says. “Even if you tell people you’ll have a million
dollars 30 years from now, the brain doesn’t get it.”
People feel more (A) if they are rewarded
(B) regardless of the amount of money.
(A) (B)
① disappointed …… randomly
② disappointed …… individually
③ relieved …… secretly
④ satisfied …… instantly
⑤ satisfied …… regularly

Imagine for a moment a group of cave people highlighted
in firelight, watching a woman scratch images onto a cave
wall. When she finishes, the woman joins her friends around
the fire and begins to tell an amazing story, her face
enhanced by the glowing orange light as she gestures at her
artwork. Her audience smiles and nods, their eyes wide and
curious. They are inspired by the woman’s words and
pictures. And the woman, encouraged by their responses,
feels proud of her work.
What was taking place in that cave? The woman was
sharing her way of seeing life and the world with her peers
for their consideration and enjoyment. Since the beginning
of time, creative people have sought out an audience, and
we’re no different today. We need to share our creations
with someone and have our work in order to feel
as if it’s worthwhile. It’s as simple as that.
An age­old question is applicable here: If a tree falls in
the forest and no one hears it, is there still a sound? The
responses of others bring value to your mode of
self­expression, be it photography, writing, painting,
scrapbooking, or baking.

[43~45] 다음을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
When Sweet Clara was twelve years old, she was taken
from her mother and sent to Home Plantation as a field
hand. (a) She could not handle the bodily demands of the
field. So her Aunt Rachel ― although she wasn’t her real
blood aunt― taught Clara how to sew so that she could
avoid the harsh conditions out in the fields.
(B)
One day, when Clara had completed the path to freedom,
Aunt Rachel watched her get ready to leave. Aunt Rachel
thought about going with her. But then (b) she said, “Before
you go, just leave me your quilt. I’m too old to go with
you. And maybe I can help others follow the quilt to
freedom.” Kissing her, Clara answered, “I think it should
stay here. It’s okay because I have a map in my memory.”
And then her quilt served as a guide to other slaves,
seeking freedom.
(C)
Clara began to sketch a map of the escape route in the
dirt of the fields. (c) She soon realized that although dirt
would wash away, she could create a map in fabric and it
would remain. She began collecting scraps of fabric as she
sewed. The work took a long time; months could go by
while (d) she waited for a scrap of cloth in the right color:
blue for creeks and rivers, green for fields, white for
roads. The more information Clara received, the larger her
quilt became.
(D)
Clara became very good at it and eventually was moved
into the Big House to sew full time. The sewing room was
just next to the kitchen. (e) She soon learned about routes
of freedom that other slaves had taken into Canada, through
the help of the Underground Railroad. There was one
difficulty with escape― there was no map to help slaves on
their way to freedom.
