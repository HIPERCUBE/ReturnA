“Humans, like most animals, have a strong preference
for immediate reward over delayed reward. If you offer
me $10 today or $11 tomorrow, I’ll probably say I’d
rather have the $10 today,” says Zweig. Even bigger
numbers don’t seem to make a difference. Financial
experts like me routinely use what­if scenarios to try to
encourage people to save more and at a younger age.
You’ve heard us say that if at age 20, you put aside
$100 a month earning 8 percent interest, you’d have
$525,454 at retirement. If you waited until you were 30
to begin, you’d have only $229,388. Yes, the examples
are striking, but by Zweig’s logic, they probably aren’t
very effective. “A reward you get in the distant future
has no emotional kick to it. It’s just a possible outcome,”
he says. “Even if you tell people you’ll have a million
dollars 30 years from now, the brain doesn’t get it.”
