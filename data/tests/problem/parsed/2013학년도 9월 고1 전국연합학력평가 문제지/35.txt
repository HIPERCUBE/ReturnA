35. Psychologists distinguish between two types of stress:
good stress, called eustress, and bad stress, called
distress. Many people would probably be surprised that
stress can benefit you and your body, but that is exactly
what eustress does. This is not only good for you; it is
actually designed .
When humans encounter a dangerous circumstance, their
breathing becomes faster, their heart rate increases, and
their throat and nose muscles open up to allow more air to
get to the lungs. This physical reaction prepares the body
either to fight the danger or to escape it. For example, if
you were alone on the street and encountered a stranger
late at night, your body might prepare your heart and lungs
to help you run away as quickly as possible from the
danger. Without eustress, you would never get this head
start.
