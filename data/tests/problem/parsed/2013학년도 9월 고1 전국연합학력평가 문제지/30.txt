30. American Coots에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The American Coots are dark, duck­like birds. They are
recognized by their chicken­like white bill, red eyes, and
small red spot at the top of their bill. They are good
swimmers and spend much of their lives floating on open
water. American Coots build floating nests in wetlands or
shallow lakes. The female lays 9 to 12 eggs, light with
brown spots. Both parents sit on the eggs and feed the
young. They eat a variety of food such as insects and
plants. They migrate from August to December, with males
moving south before the females and their babies. They are
not very good at taking off in flight. When they try to
launch themselves, they have to run along the surface of the
water for a while. *bill: 부리
