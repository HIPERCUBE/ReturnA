Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably
intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest
people in them. Even if most of the people within a
group are not especially well­informed or rational, it can
still reach a ① collectively wise decision. This is a good
thing, since human beings are not perfectly designed
decision makers. We generally have less information than
we’d like. We have ② sufficient foresight into the future.
Instead of insisting on finding the best possible decision,
we will often ③ accept one that seems good enough. And
we often let emotion affect our ④ judgement. Yet despite
all these limitations, when our imperfect opinions are
gathered in the right way, our collective intelligence is
often ⑤ excellent.
