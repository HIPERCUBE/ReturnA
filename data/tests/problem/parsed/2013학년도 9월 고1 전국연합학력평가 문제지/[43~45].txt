(A)
When Sweet Clara was twelve years old, she was taken
from her mother and sent to Home Plantation as a field
hand. (a) She could not handle the bodily demands of the
field. So her Aunt Rachel ― although she wasn’t her real
blood aunt― taught Clara how to sew so that she could
avoid the harsh conditions out in the fields.
(B)
One day, when Clara had completed the path to freedom,
Aunt Rachel watched her get ready to leave. Aunt Rachel
thought about going with her. But then (b) she said, “Before
you go, just leave me your quilt. I’m too old to go with
you. And maybe I can help others follow the quilt to
freedom.” Kissing her, Clara answered, “I think it should
stay here. It’s okay because I have a map in my memory.”
And then her quilt served as a guide to other slaves,
seeking freedom.
(C)
Clara began to sketch a map of the escape route in the
dirt of the fields. (c) She soon realized that although dirt
would wash away, she could create a map in fabric and it
would remain. She began collecting scraps of fabric as she
sewed. The work took a long time; months could go by
while (d) she waited for a scrap of cloth in the right color:
blue for creeks and rivers, green for fields, white for
roads. The more information Clara received, the larger her
quilt became.
(D)
Clara became very good at it and eventually was moved
into the Big House to sew full time. The sewing room was
just next to the kitchen. (e) She soon learned about routes
of freedom that other slaves had taken into Canada, through
the help of the Underground Railroad. There was one
difficulty with escape― there was no map to help slaves on
their way to freedom.
