(A)
If you don’t have time to walk your child to school 
every day, maybe your child could join a walking bus. 
This is a set-up by which a group of children are walked 
to school by adult volunteers along a set route. Like a 
normal bus, the walking bus follows a timetable, so 
children can be picked up at scheduled times along the 
way. The volunteers take turns supervising the “bus.” 
This is attractive because the car stays at home, which 
reduces __________ outside the school. Also, children 
are getting exercise in the morning and it’s said that if 
children exercise before class their brains are more ready 
to learn.
(B)
It is better if children can visit their friends in the 
village by themselves. Otherwise, you have to walk or 
drive to drop them off and pick them up, wasting 
valuable time. We do have to drive them to activities and 
classes though. For example, my daughter, Katie, has a 
dance class and my son, Peter, has football, both in 
neighboring villages. What I try to do is to arrange rides 
for my kids with other parents. However, I think some 
people are a bit shy about saying, “I could take them 
this week, if you could do it next week,” but I don’t 
mind asking and people are pleased when I do. It’s not 
just that it saves fuel, time, and money, but it helps to 
decrease the amount of __________ in the villages, 
which is also good for the environment.
