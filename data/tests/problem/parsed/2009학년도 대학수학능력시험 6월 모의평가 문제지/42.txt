42. The air just above a glass contains molecules that are 
layered like a cake. At the top are the lightest scents of 
flowers, then the fruity ones, then the mineral and earthy 
smells; and finally, at the bottom the heaviest scent 
elements, wood and alcohol. A good glass does not allow 
these elements to be mixed up in a disorderly way. 
Golf-ball-size cups are just too small to concentrate the 
wine’s scents. They are like seats too close to the orchestra: 
all you hear are isolated sounds from the instruments, rather 
than the harmony that comes together farther back. The 
glass doesn’t change the wine itself, but rather the way we 
smell and taste it. Some glasses are like loudspeakers: their 
shape and volume increase a wine’s natural qualities.
