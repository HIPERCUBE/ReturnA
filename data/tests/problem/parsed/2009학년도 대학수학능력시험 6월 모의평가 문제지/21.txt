21. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 어법에 맞는 표현으로 가장 
적절한 것은?
The most useful thing I brought out of my childhood 
was confidence in reading. Not long ago, I went on a 
weekend self-exploratory workshop, in the hope of getting a 
clue about how to live. One of the exercises we were given 
(A) was / were to make a list of the ten most important 
events of our lives. Number one was: “I was born,” and 
you could put (B) however / whatever you liked after that. 
Without even thinking about it, my hand wrote at number 
two: “I learned to read.” “I was born and learned to 
read” wouldn’t be a sequence that occurs to many 
people, I imagine. But I knew what I meant to say. 
Being born was something (C) done / doing to me, but 
my own life began when I first made out the meaning of 
a sentence.
(A)   (B) (C)
① was …… however …… done
② was …… whatever …… done
③ was …… whatever …… doing
④ were …… however …… doing
⑤ were …… however …… done
