before me was, I realized, a scene of almost classical 
rural beauty― the meadows dotted with contented animals, 
the woods in the background, a twisting stream threading 
through it all―spoiled only by the fact that I couldn’t 
just lie here on this springy meadow admiring it for the 
rest of the afternoon.
