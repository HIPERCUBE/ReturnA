38. The high level of euro-skepticism in Greece has brought 
a number of misunderstandings. It is commonly thought 
that the launch of the euro, Europe’s single currency, 
brought about an increase in the cost of living and this 
has affected the public’s overall opinion toward the 
European Union. The rise in prices is unquestionable but it 
is wrong to blame it on the introduction of the common 
currency. This is, firstly, because inflation existed before 
the euro and, secondly, because one cannot say where 
prices would stand today if the drachma was still in 
circulation. Therefore, high prices must be attributed to 
market distortions. The real problem is not the euro 
currency but the profiteers who are left unchecked.
* drachma: 그리스의 화폐 명칭
