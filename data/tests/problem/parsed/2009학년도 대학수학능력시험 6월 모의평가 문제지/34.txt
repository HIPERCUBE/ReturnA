Sometimes you work as hard as you can on something, 
and it doesn’t work out. I usually persist longer than most 
people would in a similar situation―which is why I often 
succeed where others have failed. I also know that 
sometimes you have to throw in the towel. I remember 
one project I spent weeks working on at my architecture 
firm. I spent many late nights trying to perfect my design, 
but it just wasn’t coming together. I finally realized that I 
had to start over from scratch. Maybe you have failed in 
similar situations, but you probably learned something 
valuable. Add it up to experience, don’t take it personally, 
and go find your next challenge!
