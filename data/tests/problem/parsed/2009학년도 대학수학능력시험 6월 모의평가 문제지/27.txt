27. Kate and her classmate, Jamie, were the youngest of the 
winning teams in the Stop Racism National Video 
Competition in 1998. Their submission depicted children 
playing at a nursery accompanied by messages such as 
“Everyone is the same; all these babies are beautiful.” 
Kate says the point of their video was to show that human 
beings are not genetically coded with racist attitudes. 
“_____________________________,” she explains. And she 
adds, “The children at the nursery don’t say, ‘I am not 
playing with you since you’re black,’ because they don’t 
really know about racism.” According to Kate, education 
begins with the younger generation. And if they grow up 
experiencing all sorts of cultures, they have less bias. [3점]
