41. We offer lengthy scientific explanations as answers to 
children’s questions, when a direct experience of something 
similar or an image that can live and work in their 
imagination would be much more satisfying to them. 
Rational explanations are like giving a hungry child stones 
instead of bread. A well-known early childhood educator 
points out that when young children ask questions like 
“Why does the sun shine?”, they are really asking about 
purpose rather than mechanics. They are much more 
nourished by an answer like “To keep us warm and to 
make the grass and the flowers grow” than a lecture on 
the relationship between heat and other forms of energy.
