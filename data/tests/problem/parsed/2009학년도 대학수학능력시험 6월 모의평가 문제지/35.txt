The above chart shows the economic advantage of 
transgenic cotton farming over conventional farming in four 
countries in 2003. ① In all the countries, the seed cost for 
the transgenic crop was higher than that for the conventional 
one. However, lower pesticide costs, higher yields, and 
higher revenues made the transgenic crop more profitable. 
② The profit ratio varied from country to country. ③ In 
Argentina, the ratio of the transgenic seed cost to the cost of 
the conventional one was higher than that of the other 
countries. ④ In South Africa, the profit ratio of the transgenic 
crop to the conventional one was the highest, followed by 
China. ⑤ Among the nations, Mexico’s crop produced the 
lowest ratios in yield and prof it as compared to the 
conventional one.
