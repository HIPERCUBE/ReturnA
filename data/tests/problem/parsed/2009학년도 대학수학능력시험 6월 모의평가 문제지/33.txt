33. In recent years, knitting has become increasingly popular 
with the younger generation. Why are so many young 
people taking up knitting as a hobby? Knitting is 
skill-oriented with the chance for them to take on 
increasingly harder challenges and to get intense 
satisfaction from accomplishing them. And in today’s 
world, where teenagers are looking for unique ways to 
express themselves, handmade clothes and accessories can 
be a smart, creative way for them to express their 
individual personalities. Despite what most people believe, 
many of today’s kids have longer attention spans than we 
think; and they are passionate about creating not just 
personal websites, but also attractive, useful knit products 
that mark their presence in the world.
