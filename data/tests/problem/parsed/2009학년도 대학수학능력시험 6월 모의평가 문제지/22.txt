Gas stations are a good example of an impersonal 
attitude. At many stations, attendants have even stopped 
① pumping gas. Motorists pull up to a gas station where 
an attendant is ② enclosed in a glass booth with a tray 
for taking money. The driver must get out of the car, 
pump the gas, and ③ walk over to the booth to pay. And 
customers with engine trouble or a non-functioning heater 
are ④ usually out of luck. Why? Many gas stations have 
gotten rid of on-duty mechanics. The skillful mechanic 
has been replaced by a teenager in a uniform ⑤ which 
doesn’t know anything about cars and couldn’t care less.
