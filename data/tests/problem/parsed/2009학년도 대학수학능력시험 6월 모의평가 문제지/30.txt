“Hey,” Jonathan said, his voice causing two small birds 
to take flight. The woman did not acknowledge him at 
all but continued to sketch. Frowning, he said a little 
louder, “Hey, lady.” Again she did not acknowledge him, 
and Jonathan began to wonder if she might be deaf. 
Purposefully, he walked up to the woman with every 
intention of telling her to leave from his backyard. She 
did not even look up at him until he was standing within 
a couple of feet of her. Only then did she look up. For 
a moment Jonathan was struck by the most amazing 
green eyes he had ever seen. He opened his mouth, but 
instead of the sharp order he had intended to bark, he 
asked quietly, “Who are you?” The woman smiled and 
he felt as if she lit up the world around her.
