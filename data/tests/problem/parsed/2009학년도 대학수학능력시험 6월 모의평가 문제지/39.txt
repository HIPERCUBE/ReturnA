39. Most people believe that intelligence plays the key role 
in children’s academic achievement. A recent study, 
however, found that the ability to self-regulate― to pay 
attention to a task and control impulsive behavior―was 
more important than intelligence for early academic 
success. Clancy Blair, who led the study, said that children 
need to be provided with self-regulating activities to 
decrease impulsiveness and instant satisfaction and to 
promote attention and awareness of their own and other’s 
thoughts and feelings. Parents are advised to engage their 
children in activities that involve taking turns, paying 
attention for sustained periods, and giving incentives for 
thoughtful responses.
