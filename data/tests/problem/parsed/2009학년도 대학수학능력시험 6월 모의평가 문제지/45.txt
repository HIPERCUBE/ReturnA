Charles Wilson was asked how his experience as 
president of a large company could apply to the 
presidents of small companies. Wilson answered that 
when he was just a boy he worked for a dairy filling 
milk bottles. The bottles were all different sizes. 
Working in the dairy he learned that no matter what  
size the bottle was, the cream, the best part of milk, 
always came to the top. You can learn the same 
lesson. It doesn’t matter what size company you work 
for; you can always be the cream. To become the 
cream, continue to learn throughout your life, be open 
to new ideas and be aware of what is going on in the 
world which will affect you. You will rise to the top.

(A)
I no longer saw (a) the big figure in the same light. 
Instead of the dull boy who I had hated for a long time, 
here was someone like me, the human being who had 
internal value and worth far beyond any externals. It was 
amazing what I had learned from being forced to run 
hand-in-hand with someone. For the rest of my life I 
have never raised a hand against (b) another person.
(B)
At some point during the course of the obligatory 
mini-marathon that both of us felt anger about, I 
remember looking over at (c) the large person beside me. 
His nose was still bleeding a bit. Tears filled his eyes. 
His giant body slowed him down. Suddenly it struck me 
that here was a person, not all that different from myself. 
I guess (d) my unwilling partner thought the same thing 
because we both looked at each other and began to 
laugh. In time, we became good friends.
(C)
The gym teacher walked into the room, and recognized 
that I had been fighting with Matt. He sent us out to the 
running track. He followed us with a smile on his face 
and said, “I want both of you to run the track holding 
each other’s hands.” The class captain erupted into a roar 
of laughter, and we were embarrassed beyond belief. 
Hesitantly, (e) my enemy and I started running. What had 
earlier been fists were now linked in a strange 
handshake.

(A)
If you don’t have time to walk your child to school 
every day, maybe your child could join a walking bus. 
This is a set-up by which a group of children are walked 
to school by adult volunteers along a set route. Like a 
normal bus, the walking bus follows a timetable, so 
children can be picked up at scheduled times along the 
way. The volunteers take turns supervising the “bus.” 
This is attractive because the car stays at home, which 
reduces __________ outside the school. Also, children 
are getting exercise in the morning and it’s said that if 
children exercise before class their brains are more ready 
to learn.
(B)
It is better if children can visit their friends in the 
village by themselves. Otherwise, you have to walk or 
drive to drop them off and pick them up, wasting 
valuable time. We do have to drive them to activities and 
classes though. For example, my daughter, Katie, has a 
dance class and my son, Peter, has football, both in 
neighboring villages. What I try to do is to arrange rides 
for my kids with other parents. However, I think some 
people are a bit shy about saying, “I could take them 
this week, if you could do it next week,” but I don’t 
mind asking and people are pleased when I do. It’s not 
just that it saves fuel, time, and money, but it helps to 
decrease the amount of __________ in the villages, 
which is also good for the environment.
