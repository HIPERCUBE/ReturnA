Charles Wilson was asked how his experience as 
president of a large company could apply to the 
presidents of small companies. Wilson answered that 
when he was just a boy he worked for a dairy filling 
milk bottles. The bottles were all different sizes. 
Working in the dairy he learned that no matter what  
size the bottle was, the cream, the best part of milk, 
always came to the top. You can learn the same 
lesson. It doesn’t matter what size company you work 
for; you can always be the cream. To become the 
cream, continue to learn throughout your life, be open 
to new ideas and be aware of what is going on in the 
world which will affect you. You will rise to the top.
