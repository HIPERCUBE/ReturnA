18. 밑줄 친 This가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
This is an old word that translates as “scholar” or 
“intellectual” in the sense of someone who exhibits all of 
the most admirable virtues attributed to Confucianism, 
especially during the Joseon Dynasty. He was presented 
as the ideal human being who was selfless and  
disciplined. So, he was held up as a model of morality 
for all people in the Confucian society. He was also 
dedicated to the prosperity of the nation in politics and 
philosophy. In modern Korean society, scholars are still 
expected to keep the spirit that such a man had. However, 
in reality, it is very hard to live up to such ideals.
