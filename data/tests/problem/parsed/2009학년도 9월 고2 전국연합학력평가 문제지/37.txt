37. Aristotle에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Aristotle was a rich doctor’s son who came to Plato’s
Academy when he was 17. He left it after Plato died. After
traveling and doing independent research, he established a
college which he called Lyceum. Aristotle organized his
teaching very thoroughly, and his Lyceum resembled a
modern research institute. He collected plants and animals
from all parts of the world for his work in biology. And
they were available to great numbers of research students.
Much of Aristotle’s teaching was done for the less advanced
students. Most of the writing that uses his name as author
was a collection of notes his students wrote during his
lectures.
