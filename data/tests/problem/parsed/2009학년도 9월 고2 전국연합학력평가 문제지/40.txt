Youngsters should also change their ways of thinking.
NEET stands for “Not currently engaged in Employment,
Education or Training.” ( ① ) According to a report, NEETs
are defined as 15­ to 29­year­old youngsters who have been
jobless for a long time but are not actively seeking
employment. ( ② ) NEETs don’t even consider employment
a possibility. ( ③ ) Therefore, they have become a more
serious problem for not only households, but also society
and the economy. ( ④ ) It is time for the government to
pay attention to NEETs, because a society with a large
number of jobless youth can never be healthy. ( ⑤ )
Instead of wasting valuable time with unreasonably high
hopes, they should face reality, lower their expectations, and
keep looking for work.
