25. Two powerful instincts which exist in all human beings
can be used in teaching: desire to be with other people and
enjoyment of play. Give 50 people four hours to climb a hill
and walk down the valley to the nearest town. If they do
this separately, many will arrive late, and nearly all will be
tired. But if they go in groups, they will be much less tired
and they will arrive sooner. They will stay together, and
they will enjoy the experience. Similarly, if a teacher can
get a class of 30 students to feel that they are all working
together, and if he can give them some reason to enjoy it,
the students will than if they had been
forced.
