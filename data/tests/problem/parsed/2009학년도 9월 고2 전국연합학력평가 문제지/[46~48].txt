(A) After working for 25 years as an officer in California,
Nancy retired and wanted to work for the community. She
decided to volunteer for the Red Cross because the
organization had always appealed to her. She spent a
month in Texas in August-September 2008 to respond to
Hurricane Ike, which completely destroyed Galveston and
other areas on the Gulf Coast.
(B) The woman, a 94­year­old grandmother, lived alone in
Galveston and was moved out to the San Antonio shelter.
With the added stress of the situation, she couldn’t
remember where she lived or her granddaughter’s last
name. She feared that (a) she would die in the shelter.
Luckily, the granddaughter was calling all the shelters to
look for (b) her, and Nancy was able to put the two
together.
(C) (c) She was assigned to an office to reunite people
who had lost track of each other during the evacuation
and the confusion caused by the storm. While visiting a
small shelter in San Antonio, she and the other volunteers
noticed an elderly woman lying curled up on a camp bed
and looking extremely depressed.
(D) She handed the phone to (d) her so that she could
talk to her granddaughter. Nancy watched with tears in
her eyes as a wonderful smile lit up the elderly woman’s
face. She was immediately changed. She went from being
alone and weak in the middle of a disaster to hearing the
voice of someone she loved, someone that knew (e) her
and cared for her.
