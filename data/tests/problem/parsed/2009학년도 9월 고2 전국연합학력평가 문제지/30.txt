하지 않은 것은? [3점]
The middle letters in the two words in the figure above
are physically ① identical. Yet, most English speakers
respond to them differently, see them differently, pronounce
them differently, and remember them differently. They think
one represents ② the letter H and the other represents the
letter A. Indeed, it would be more appropriate to say that
one is the letter H and the other is the letter A. The
identity of an inky squiggle has ③ less to do with how it is
objectively constructed, and has more to do with how we
subjectively interpret it. Two ④ horizontal lines with a
crossbar mean one thing when they are situated between T
and E, and they mean ⑤ another thing when they are
between C and T.
