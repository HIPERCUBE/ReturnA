This is a traditional game usually played by girls and
young women in Korea. This seems popular especially at
New Year’s, when it gives the players a chance to show off
their new clothes. To do this, a rolled­up straw mat under a
long board is needed. Two players jump at either end of the
board. As one player returns to the board, the other is
propelled into the air. This is said to have been very
popular in the old days because it provided the opportunity
for the women to see over the walls of their houses. They
were seldom allowed to go outside their homes.
