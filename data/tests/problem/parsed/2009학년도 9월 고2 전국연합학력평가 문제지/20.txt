We have breaking news on the spreading swine flu virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) raised the alert level
to stage five. This means that there has been
human­to­human spreading of the virus in at least two
countries in one region. The WHO announced that a
pandemic is about to happen. The raise in the alert level
came after it was confirmed in Europe that humans spread
the disease to each other. Over in Spain a patient has a
disease even though he has never been to Mexico. More
cases were reported in Britain, Germany and Austria.
