Language translation was an early goal of computer
science, but there is still a long way to go. The reason is
simple: It doesn’t always work. Translation errors occur due
to the complex features of computers, languages and minds.
Even with an excellent dictionary and complete grammar
knowledge of both languages, machine translation is often
inaccurate. The meaning of a sentence is not often fully
contained in its words. There is something else, called
context, that a speaker and a listener (or a writer and a
reader) bring to language to get its exact meaning. Without
the context, accurate computer translation is often not
possible.
Despite the efforts made over the past years, perfect
computer translation is still regarded as a (A) )
because computers can’t fully (B) the context.

① dream …… ignore
② reality …… produce
③ miracle …… exclude
④ challenge …… understand
⑤ simplicity …… infer

(A) After working for 25 years as an officer in California,
Nancy retired and wanted to work for the community. She
decided to volunteer for the Red Cross because the

month in Texas in August-September 2008 to respond to
Hurricane Ike, which completely destroyed Galveston and
other areas on the Gulf Coast.
(B) The woman, a 94­year­old grandmother, lived alone in

look for (b) her, and Nancy was able to put the two
together.
(C) (c) She was assigned to an office to reunite people

(A) Sitting in front of the television is one of the most
popular pastimes in the world. According to a survey, the
average individual spends over 4 hours per day watching
television. It is no wonder, then, that television can be
of advertising despite the
Internet’s steady rise in popularity. Advertising on
television allows you to show and tell your business,
product, or service to a wider audience than local
newspapers and radio stations do. Through a TV ad, you
can also use not only graphics and words, but also motion,
light and a number of other features that will make your
message seem even more effective.
(B) No other advertising medium is likely to use up your
budget as quickly as TV will. Producing an ad, which
usually includes hiring script writers, actors, film editors,
or an advertising agency, is just the beginning. You must
also pay for air time. Because a TV ad can be
only with repetition, you’ll almost
certainly want to run your ad many times. Another factor
you need to realize is how difficult it can be to make
changes to your ads. With newspaper advertising, you
have only to update the sale pricing or a special offer.
Yet, with television advertising, it means updating your
script and remaking the entire ad, which costs you
additional money.
