18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
This is a traditional game usually played by girls and
young women in Korea. This seems popular especially at
New Year’s, when it gives the players a chance to show off
their new clothes. To do this, a rolled­up straw mat under a
long board is needed. Two players jump at either end of the
board. As one player returns to the board, the other is
propelled into the air. This is said to have been very
popular in the old days because it provided the opportunity
for the women to see over the walls of their houses. They
were seldom allowed to go outside their homes.
① 널뛰기 ② 윷놀이 ③ 장기
④ 제기차기 ⑤ 연날리기
19. 밑줄 친 he[He]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Born in Moscow in 1866, Kandinsky studied law and at
the age of 30 was offered a professorship at a university.
But ① he had been inspired by the French Impressionists.
② He refused the university job and moved to Germany to
study painting full time. Much of his early work depended
on the folk art ③ he experienced in Germany and in Russia.
“Pure color” would become the central focus of his best
works. One art critic said that a new, spiritual age was
about to begin with him. ④He saw the artist as a pioneer
moving into the future. The paintings ⑤ he produced at the
time are full of joy and liberation.

We have breaking news on the spreading swine flu virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) raised the alert level
to stage five. This means that there has been
human­to­human spreading of the virus in at least two
countries in one region. The WHO announced that a
pandemic is about to happen. The raise in the alert level
came after it was confirmed in Europe that humans spread
the disease to each other. Over in Spain a patient has a
disease even though he has never been to Mexico. More
cases were reported in Britain, Germany and Austria.

Sissi was not discouraged as a child by the boys who
wouldn’t let her ① play her favorite game. Eventually, she got
her way on the streets of Salvador, Brazil, because the soccer
ball that the boys wanted to play with was ② hers. Still, she
often ran home with her ball after she grew ③ frustrating
with the negative attitudes the boys displayed. Sissi had
learned to play soccer by practicing with all kinds of objects
④ that she found around the house. These included rolled­up
socks and the heads of her dolls. Her father finally decided
that she needed a soccer ball to keep her from ⑤ destroying
her dolls.
23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
When we think of leaders in marketing and branding
sectors, Disney comes to our mind first. ①Disney has
geniuses in promoting its brand, magnificent marketers,
leaders in the theme park industry, and a universally
recognized brand. ②Then what could possibly go wrong with
its expansion into Hong Kong and the Asia­Pacific market?
③ It was cultural misunderstanding which led Disney to
unpredicted headaches and problems when expanding into
global markets and working with other cultures. ④All
businesses seeking to explore international markets must
consider national interests rather than cultural differences.
⑤ The lesson to be learned here is to spend time and
money in understanding your overseas markets and the
culture where you will be doing business.

24. Back in 18th century Europe, Louis XV made it
fashionable for men to powder their noses and rouge their
lips. The Beatles in the 1960s broke women’s hearts with
their long hair and thin, boyish figures. Nowadays singers
like Big Bang put on smoky eye makeup, while the main
actors in “Boys Over Flowers” enjoy pastel sweaters and
curly hair. Middle­aged men, like women, are obsessed with
perfect skin and thin waistlines. Flawless skin and colorful
clothes are the key to completing the pretty boy look. Men
who want to be beautiful also show in floral
prints and pastel colors. Women are no longer the only
customers.
① fear ② interest ③ neglect
④ mercy ⑤ indifference
25. Two powerful instincts which exist in all human beings
can be used in teaching: desire to be with other people and
enjoyment of play. Give 50 people four hours to climb a hill
and walk down the valley to the nearest town. If they do
this separately, many will arrive late, and nearly all will be
tired. But if they go in groups, they will be much less tired
and they will arrive sooner. They will stay together, and
they will enjoy the experience. Similarly, if a teacher can
get a class of 30 students to feel that they are all working
together, and if he can give them some reason to enjoy it,
the students will than if they had been
forced.
①　do better work ②　drop out more
③ study fewer hours ④　feel less comfortable
⑤ respect teachers less
26. The change from a struggling, active survival to today’s
more inactive lifestyle has played a major role in the rise of
obesity. Two million years ago the expansion of the human
brain required energy­rich food. To find foods that are much
richer in calories and nutrients, our ancestors had to run and
hunt over large areas of land, meaning they burned up a lot
of the calories. With the shift to less active lifestyles,
humans now have a diet that contains far more calories than
they need to survive. Moreover, we can simply pick up the
phone to get a meal delivered to our door. In short,
has contributed to obesity and
long­term health problems.
① the limit to daily calories
② the decline in physical activity
③ the growth of the food industry
④ the poor quality of delivery service
⑤ the access to nutrient­balanced food
27. On April 12, 1965, baseball changed the world of stadium
architecture by opening the Harris County Domed Stadium in
Houston. It became better known to the world as the
Houston Astrodome. It was the world’s first enclosed and
air­conditioned stadium for baseball. Before the domed
stadium existed, baseball players in Houston had been
playing outdoors in the mosquito­filled humidity and,
sometimes, in extreme heat. If the domed stadium had not
been built, major league baseball may not have survived in
Houston, because passionate baseball players as well as
professional players could not have .
① enjoyed more home runs
② played baseball games at night
③ seen much nicer baseball stadiums
④ endured the uncomfortable weather
⑤ welcomed the formation of a new league
28. 다음 글에 드러난 Heather의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Heather loved the freedom of flying above the land. One
day she was hang­gliding when she noticed a red hawk
rapidly approaching her. Then she heard its claws ripping
the fabric of the glider’s wing. It flew off. But the next
thing she knew was that it was flying straight at her. She
turned out of its way, but it dove at her again. She had to
avoid its attacks four times before she was able to land
safely. As she drove home, she found out that she had been
lucky. The radio news reported that a hang­glider had been
attacked and injured by not one, but two hawks.

The middle letters in the two words in the figure above
are physically ① identical. Yet, most English speakers
respond to them differently, see them differently, pronounce
them differently, and remember them differently. They think
one represents ② the letter H and the other represents the
letter A. Indeed, it would be more appropriate to say that
one is the letter H and the other is the letter A. The
identity of an inky squiggle has ③ less to do with how it is
objectively constructed, and has more to do with how we
subjectively interpret it. Two ④ horizontal lines with a
crossbar mean one thing when they are situated between T
and E, and they mean ⑤ another thing when they are
between C and T.

32. If you want to interact with people in a country, staying
on ranches and cattle farms offers a great opportunity for a
cross­cultural exchange and a real experience of life in
another country. With more hands­on activities you can
practice a new language, learn to cook traditional dishes, or
see a neighborhood through the eyes of someone who lives
there. By the time you leave, you feel less like a guest and
more like a member of the family. For travelers on a
budget, farmstays can be a real bargain over hotels and
other types of accommodation.
① types of farmstays
② rules for farmstays
③ advantages of farmstays
④ inconveniences of farmstays
⑤ ways of arranging farmstays
33. In 1808, when the slave trade was banned, many
southerners in the U.S. thought that slavery would soon end.
But the expectation proved false. During the next generation,
new factors made slavery far more profitable than it had
been before 1790. One of the main factors was the rise of a
great cotton­growing industry in the South. At the same
time, the Industrial Revolution, which made textile
manufacturing a big business, greatly increased the demand
for raw cotton. Moreover, the opening of new lands in the
west after 1812 vastly extended the area available for
cotton cultivation.

34. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Here is a big secret of life on earth. The more nice things
you say, the more nice things you will hear or see. What
matters is not how much you say, but how much nice stuff
you say. However, what if only negative thoughts are in
your mind? In that case, saying nothing is so much better
than saying something hurtful, angry, or bad. It gives you
some time to cool down and to figure out why you’re so
angry. Saying nothing prevents you from saying something
you can never take back. You can’t get into trouble for
something you never say.
① 말수가 적은 사람은 스스로 고쳐야 한다.

⑤ 수다스러운 사람에게는 그의 단점을 알려 주어야 한다.

The above graph shows the real GDP growth rate of
Egypt, the World average rate and the MENA average rate
from 2003 to 2008. ①Though the real GDP growth rate of
Egypt was the lowest in 2003, it ranked top among the
three in 2008. ② Egypt recorded the highest leap in the real
GDP growth rate between 2005 and 2006. ③ In 2003, the
World average rate was almost twice as high as that of
Egypt. ④The World average rate stayed within the range of
5% and 7% from 2003 to 2008. ⑤ In 2008, the MENA
average rate was less than half of the real GDP growth rate
of Egypt.
36. Toco toucan에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The Toco toucan is at home in South America’s tropical
forests but can be seen everywhere. Its oversized, colorful
bill has made it one of the world’s most popular birds. The
toucan’s long bill is useful as a feeding tool. The bird uses
it to reach fruit on branches that are too small to sit on,
and also to peel the fruit. In addition to fruit, Toco toucans
eat insects and, sometimes, eggs or lizards. Although the
colorful bill looks nice and helps in eating, it is not a
practical weapon. While its size may be frightening to
enemies, it is of little use in combating them.
① 남미 지역 외에서는 찾아볼 수 없다.
② 작고 화려한 부리로 인해 인기가 있다.

④ 나무 열매뿐만 아니라 곤충이나 도마뱀도 먹는다.
⑤ 부리는 적과 싸우는 아주 유용한 무기다.
37. Aristotle에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Aristotle was a rich doctor’s son who came to Plato’s
Academy when he was 17. He left it after Plato died. After
traveling and doing independent research, he established a
college which he called Lyceum. Aristotle organized his
teaching very thoroughly, and his Lyceum resembled a
modern research institute. He collected plants and animals
from all parts of the world for his work in biology. And
they were available to great numbers of research students.
Much of Aristotle’s teaching was done for the less advanced
students. Most of the writing that uses his name as author
was a collection of notes his students wrote during his
lectures.
① 플라톤의 사망 이후 Academy를 떠났다.
② Lyceum이라는 대학을 설립했다.
③ 생물 연구를 위해 세계에서 동식물을 수집했다.
④ 주로 뛰어난 학생들을 대상으로 가르쳤다.
⑤ 그의 글 중 대부분은 제자들이 그의 강의를 기록한 것이다.

38. Jane’s first neighbor always shut the door very loudly.
After he moved out, a pianist who played two hours a day
moved in. She called the police for the noise. On the other
hand, Howard said he has been lucky with his neighbors.
One neighbor was a chef, who would bring him the leftovers
late at night. Another neighbor was a saxophonist who
played lovely music early in the morning. As you see above,
different people have different attitudes towards what they
have now. Someone sees the pianist as irritating, yet
another sees the saxophonist as delightful. Millions of people
would be glad to have a roof over their head. Yet there are
millions who would complain their roof is the wrong color.

39. Review your goals and act on them daily. If you spend ten
minutes or ten hours focusing on your goals, you will move
toward them. Don’t wait for next year, next month or even
tomorrow. Do something today. If you want to get ahead,
you’ve got to start moving! A baby step is better than no
step. And babies actually move pretty fast! Only consistent
action will produce the results you want. Identify your aims.
Focus on the ones which are most important to you, and act
on them now.

곳은?
Youngsters should also change their ways of thinking.
NEET stands for “Not currently engaged in Employment,
Education or Training.” ( ① ) According to a report, NEETs
are defined as 15­ to 29­year­old youngsters who have been
jobless for a long time but are not actively seeking
employment. ( ② ) NEETs don’t even consider employment
a possibility. ( ③ ) Therefore, they have become a more
serious problem for not only households, but also society
and the economy. ( ④ ) It is time for the government to
pay attention to NEETs, because a society with a large
number of jobless youth can never be healthy. ( ⑤ )
Instead of wasting valuable time with unreasonably high
hopes, they should face reality, lower their expectations, and
keep looking for work.

41. Few places on earth can match Madagascar as an
eco­tourism destination. About 70% of Madagascar’s animals
are found only in this island nation. But Madagascar hasn’t
always been great at displaying its biological richness. Its
tourism industry remains still small, but that’s beginning to
change. The current government is in the middle of tripling
the size of its national park system, and local­guide
networks are springing up around the country. These efforts
are coming at the right time, with “green” travel worldwide
growing three times as fast as the entire travel industry.

42. Because the harp has a wide range of sound, it sends
vibrations through the body better than other musical
instruments. Research shows the harp’s vibration stimulates
the body’s organs, which helps the body’s instinct for
fighting disease. Sara J. Williams, physical therapist, found
that people with a lot of neuromuscular disorders really
benefited from the harp. Theories about the harp’s effect are
not new. Traditionally called the instrument of a Greek god,
or of the angels, the harp has long been an instrument of
cure in western culture.

Now, in the fall, several trees had been cut down and the
roads were muddy. I rode on a military truck. I looked at
the countryside. The mulberry trees were bare and the
fields were brown. There were wet dead leaves on the road.
It had been raining in the mountains. We came in to the
town past the factories and then the houses. I noticed that
more houses had been destroyed by enemy missiles. On a
narrow street we passed a Red Cross ambulance carrying
wounded people. The driver wore a cap and his face was
thin and very suntanned.

Tabei discovered her love of the mountains early. After

(A) She climbed whenever she could. However, women were

Language translation was an early goal of computer
science, but there is still a long way to go. The reason is
simple: It doesn’t always work. Translation errors occur due
to the complex features of computers, languages and minds.
Even with an excellent dictionary and complete grammar
knowledge of both languages, machine translation is often
inaccurate. The meaning of a sentence is not often fully
contained in its words. There is something else, called
context, that a speaker and a listener (or a writer and a
reader) bring to language to get its exact meaning. Without
the context, accurate computer translation is often not
possible.
Despite the efforts made over the past years, perfect
computer translation is still regarded as a (A) )
because computers can’t fully (B) the context.

① dream …… ignore
② reality …… produce
③ miracle …… exclude

(A) After working for 25 years as an officer in California,
Nancy retired and wanted to work for the community. She
decided to volunteer for the Red Cross because the
organization had always appealed to her. She spent a
month in Texas in August-September 2008 to respond to
Hurricane Ike, which completely destroyed Galveston and
other areas on the Gulf Coast.
(B) The woman, a 94­year­old grandmother, lived alone in
Galveston and was moved out to the San Antonio shelter.
With the added stress of the situation, she couldn’t
remember where she lived or her granddaughter’s last
name. She feared that (a) she would die in the shelter.
Luckily, the granddaughter was calling all the shelters to
look for (b) her, and Nancy was able to put the two

(C) (c) She was assigned to an office to reunite people
who had lost track of each other during the evacuation

small shelter in San Antonio, she and the other volunteers
noticed an elderly woman lying curled up on a camp bed
and looking extremely depressed.
(D) She handed the phone to (d) her so that she could
talk to her granddaughter. Nancy watched with tears in
her eyes as a wonderful smile lit up the elderly woman’s

[49~50] 다음 글을 읽고 물음에 답하시오.
(A) Sitting in front of the television is one of the most
popular pastimes in the world. According to a survey, the
average individual spends over 4 hours per day watching
television. It is no wonder, then, that television can be
of advertising despite the
Internet’s steady rise in popularity. Advertising on
television allows you to show and tell your business,
product, or service to a wider audience than local
newspapers and radio stations do. Through a TV ad, you
can also use not only graphics and words, but also motion,
light and a number of other features that will make your
message seem even more effective.
(B) No other advertising medium is likely to use up your
budget as quickly as TV will. Producing an ad, which
usually includes hiring script writers, actors, film editors,
or an advertising agency, is just the beginning. You must
also pay for air time. Because a TV ad can be
only with repetition, you’ll almost
certainly want to run your ad many times. Another factor
you need to realize is how difficult it can be to make
changes to your ads. With newspaper advertising, you
have only to update the sale pricing or a special offer.
Yet, with television advertising, it means updating your
script and remaking the entire ad, which costs you
additional money.
