38. Jane’s first neighbor always shut the door very loudly.
After he moved out, a pianist who played two hours a day
moved in. She called the police for the noise. On the other
hand, Howard said he has been lucky with his neighbors.
One neighbor was a chef, who would bring him the leftovers
late at night. Another neighbor was a saxophonist who
played lovely music early in the morning. As you see above,
different people have different attitudes towards what they
have now. Someone sees the pianist as irritating, yet
another sees the saxophonist as delightful. Millions of people
would be glad to have a roof over their head. Yet there are
millions who would complain their roof is the wrong color.
