southerners in the U.S. thought that slavery would soon end.

new factors made slavery far more profitable than it had
been before 1790. One of the main factors was the rise of a
great cotton­growing industry in the South. At the same

manufacturing a big business, greatly increased the demand
for raw cotton. Moreover, the opening of new lands in the
west after 1812 vastly extended the area available for
cotton cultivation.
