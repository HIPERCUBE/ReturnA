Heather loved the freedom of flying above the land. One
day she was hang­gliding when she noticed a red hawk
rapidly approaching her. Then she heard its claws ripping
the fabric of the glider’s wing. It flew off. But the next
thing she knew was that it was flying straight at her. She
turned out of its way, but it dove at her again. She had to

safely. As she drove home, she found out that she had been
lucky. The radio news reported that a hang­glider had been
attacked and injured by not one, but two hawks.
