24. Back in 18th century Europe, Louis XV made it
fashionable for men to powder their noses and rouge their
lips. The Beatles in the 1960s broke women’s hearts with
their long hair and thin, boyish figures. Nowadays singers
like Big Bang put on smoky eye makeup, while the main
actors in “Boys Over Flowers” enjoy pastel sweaters and
curly hair. Middle­aged men, like women, are obsessed with
perfect skin and thin waistlines. Flawless skin and colorful
clothes are the key to completing the pretty boy look. Men
who want to be beautiful also show in floral
prints and pastel colors. Women are no longer the only
customers.
