(A) Sitting in front of the television is one of the most
popular pastimes in the world. According to a survey, the
average individual spends over 4 hours per day watching
television. It is no wonder, then, that television can be
of advertising despite the
Internet’s steady rise in popularity. Advertising on
television allows you to show and tell your business,
product, or service to a wider audience than local
newspapers and radio stations do. Through a TV ad, you
can also use not only graphics and words, but also motion,
light and a number of other features that will make your
message seem even more effective.
(B) No other advertising medium is likely to use up your
budget as quickly as TV will. Producing an ad, which
usually includes hiring script writers, actors, film editors,
or an advertising agency, is just the beginning. You must
also pay for air time. Because a TV ad can be
only with repetition, you’ll almost
certainly want to run your ad many times. Another factor
you need to realize is how difficult it can be to make
changes to your ads. With newspaper advertising, you
have only to update the sale pricing or a special offer.
Yet, with television advertising, it means updating your
script and remaking the entire ad, which costs you
additional money.
