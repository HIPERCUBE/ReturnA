Dear Ms. Mattie,
Thank you very much for offering me the research 
engineer position at ABC Company. However, after 
a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept 
the position. Your company has an excellent reputation 
as a research institution and has many aspects that 
are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot 
accept your offer because I have decided to pursue 
another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your 
consideration. 
Very truly yours,

Obviously, one of the judgments the public has of us is 
whether or not our telephone service is good. Technically, if 
they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they 
get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. 
They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner 
that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy 
and consideration; and they are in a position to get what 
they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the 
bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and 
fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for 
a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must 
have a philosophy and a method of doing business which 
will allow and insure that its people serve the public 
efficiently and in a pleasing manner.

20. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
On the path to excellence, some obstacles may initially 
seem overwhelming. Every performer experiences this feeling, 
even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe 
that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove 
yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly 
impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, 
focusing on what is within your control, taking the first 
step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step 
after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember 
your dream and why it is important to you, find simple 
joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or 
small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing 
learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you 
will get through and find a way through all obstacles.

21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
For many years now, mediated entertainment such as TV 
and film has been able to stimulate our optical and auditory 
senses with sights and sounds. Some forms of new media, 
however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The 
view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on 
the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the 
computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and 
move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and 
rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of 
motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, 
such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the 
California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell 
orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated 
hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of 
emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to 
experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate 
reality by stimulating our senses.

22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Recently, researchers have suggested that the purpose of 
laughter is not just to communicate that one is in a playful 
state, but to actually induce this state in others as well. 
According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have 
a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional 
arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, 
perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this 
way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of 
coupling together the positive emotions of members of a 
group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would 
explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone 
laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and 
begin laughing too.
① effects of laughter on others
② benefits of activating brain circuits
③ strategies for coordinating activities
④ negative aspects of emotional reactions
⑤ importance of grouping in communication

26. Tammy Rahr에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
During her childhood years, the artist Tammy Rahr spent 
a lot of time outdoors making things from flowers and dirt. 
Then Tammy and her family moved from the woodlands of 
New York State to an urban city outside of Los Angeles, 
California. The experience made her more aware of what was 
going on in the world. After returning to New York State 
with her family, Tammy faced another lesson in growing up. 
A gifted student, she was sent to college when she was just 
14. Tammy was able to earn her high school diploma and 
some college credit before trying her hand at a number of 
different jobs. Eventually, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, 
and studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts. After 
graduating from the institute, she remained active with it and 
the museum there.

In the twentieth century, advances in technology, from 
refrigeration to sophisticated ovens to air transportation 
① that carries fresh ingredients around the world, contributed 
immeasurably to baking and pastry making. At the beginning 
of the twenty-first century, the popularity of fine breads and 
pastries ② are growing even faster than new chefs can be 
trained. Interestingly enough, many of the technological advances 
in bread making have sparked a reaction among bakers and 
consumers ③ alike. They are looking to reclaim some of the 
flavors of old-fashioned breads that ④ were lost as baking 
became more industrialized and baked goods became more 
refined, standardized, and― some would say― flavorless. 
Bakers are researching methods for ⑤ producing the handmade 
sourdough breads of the past, and they are experimenting 
with specialty flours in their search for flavor.
32. I would like to compare the shift from analog to 
digital film-making to the shift from fresco and tempera 
to oil painting in the early Renaissance. A painter making 
a fresco has limited time before the paint dries, and once 
it has dried, no further changes to the image are possible. 
Similarly, a traditional filmmaker has limited means of 
modifying images once they are recorded on film. 
Medieval tempera painting can be compared to the 
practice of special effects during the analog period of 
cinema. A painter working with tempera could modify 
and rework the image, but the process was painstaking 
and slow. The switch to oils greatly liberated painters by 
allowing them to quickly create much larger compositions 
as well as to modify them as long as necessary. Similarly,
, 
digital technology redefines what can be done with 
cinema. [3점]
① by equating oil painting with analog film-making
② by allowing a filmmaker to treat a film image as an 
oil painting
③ with the shift from oil painting styles to fresco ones 
in making films
④ by integrating fresco painting techniques into the 
film-making process
⑤ with the introduction of tempera painting methods to 
cinematic special effects

When there is a discrepancy between the verbal message 
and the nonverbal message, the latter typically weighs more 
in forming a judgment. (A) , a friend might react 
to a plan for dinner with a comment like “that’s good,” but 
with little vocal enthusiasm and a muted facial expression. 
In spite of the verbal comment, the lack of expressive 
enthusiasm suggests that the plan isn’t viewed very 
positively. In such a case, the purpose of the positive 
comment might be to avoid a disagreement and support the 
friend, but the lack of a positive expression unintentionally 
leaks a more candid, negative reaction to the plan. Of 
course, the muted expressive display might also be strategic 
and intentional. (B) , the nonverbal message is 
deliberate, but designed to let the partner know one’s candid 
reaction indirectly. It is then the partner’s responsibility to 
interpret the nonverbal message and make some adjustment 
in the plan.
(A) (B)
① In addition …… Instead
② In addition …… However
③ In contrast …… That is
④ For example …… However
⑤ For example …… That is
34. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Early one night in 1973 in my old and cheap apartment 
in Bangor, Maine, I got a phone call from my agent, Bill, 
who was helping me publish my first novel. “Are you 
sitting down?” Bill asked. “No,” I said. “Do I need to?” 
“You might,” he said. “The publication rights for your 
book were sold for four hundred thousand dollars!” I was 
completely speechless. That amount of money was beyond 
my wildest expectations. I was sure I hadn’t heard him 
right. I couldn’t have. I asked, “Did you say it went for 
forty thousand dollars?” Bill said it again as clearly as he 
could, “Four hundred thousand dollars. Congratulations, 
Steve.” “Are you sure, Bill?” I said in disbelief. He said he 
was. We talked for another half an hour, but I don’t 
remember a single word of what we said.

③ astonished ④ sympathetic

35. Music can convey the scope of a film, effectively 
communicating whether the motion picture is an epic drama 
or a story that exists on a more personal scale. Music can 
convey the quality and size of a space. ① For example, in 
Alien and Olivier’s Hamlet, the music serves at times to make 
small and/or artificial spaces seem more grand and to 
enhance the sense of realism. ② In addition, music can 
establish a narrative’s placement in time. ③Music for motion 
pictures often serves to authenticate the era or to provide a 
sense of nostalgia. ④Music has traditionally been classified 
by musical instruments. ⑤ Examples of the former would 
include Amadeus and Immortal Beloved, while a sense of 
nostalgia is communicated through the music selected for 
films such as American Graffiti and The Big Chill.
36. It is difficult to appreciate what a temperature of 
20,000,000℃ means. ① If the solar surface, not the center, 
were as hot as this, the radiation emitted into space would 
be so great that the whole Earth would be vaporized within 
a few minutes. ② Indeed, this is just what would happen if 
some cosmic giant were to peel off the outer layers of the 
Sun like skinning an orange, for the tremendously hot inner 
regions would then be exposed. ③ It is believed that the 
brightness of the Sun can be predicted theoretically. 
④ Fortunately, no such circumstance is possible, and the 
outer layers of the Sun provide a sort of blanket that protects 
us from its inner fires. ⑤Yet in spite of these blanketing 
layers, some energy must leak through from the Sun’s center 
to its outer regions, and this leakage is of just the right 
amount to compensate for the radiation emitted by the 
surface into surrounding space.

Mom and Dad went to dinner at a nice restaurant. On 
that first night to myself, Dad entrusted me with his 
movie projector and all the reels of film. 
(A) Then I can play the film backward and watch the cat fly 
down to the floor and see all the splashes of ice cream 
slurp themselves back into the dish. I made Simon jump in 
and out several times before I watched the rest of the film.
(B) He said I could do everything myself that night. So I 
set up the screen at one end of the living room. I turned 
on the projector, turned off the light, put the bowl of 
popcorn in my lap, and settled in to watch the film 
labeled HATTIE-1951.

Since group performance in problem solving is superior to 
even the individual work of the most expert group members, 
it should not be surprising that students learn better when 
they cooperate. However, there is one issue that needs further 
consideration.
(A) In addition to that benefit, helping lower-ability students 
often pulls higher-ability students to a more sophisticated 
understanding of the material. The cliché that teachers 
learn as much as their pupils is certainly true.
(B) Not quite. Knowledge, happily, is not a zero-sum product. 
Higher-ability students can reinforce their own knowledge 
by teaching those with lower ability.
(C) Specifically, the technique of having students help one 
another raises the question of whether students with lower 
ability are being helped at the expense of those with 
higher ability. Is this true?

But no one, even your child, is exactly like you.
Parents often believe that they are providing help to their 
children when they constantly correct and criticize them, 
assuming that they will grow from these remarks. But ask 
yourself: Do you like being corrected? Do you grow when 
you are constantly criticized? ( ① ) In truth, we tend to 
stay the same when we are criticized. ( ② ) We want to 
defend what we have done, and our innate stubbornness 
refuses to permit us to accept the criticism we are receiving. 
( ③ ) Behind virtually all criticism is the sentence “If only 
you were more like me, and living life as I see it, you 
would be a lot better off.” ( ④ ) Praise your children for 
attempting a task, even if it was unsuccessful, and for 
taking risks. ( ⑤ ) Create an environment in which your 
children know that you are with them in their efforts, rather 
than looking to criticize them.

An ant turns right, left, and moves ahead over a sandy 
hill. How can we explain the complexity of the path it 
chose? We can think up a sophisticated program in the 
ant’s brain, but it does not work. What we have 
overlooked is the ant’s environment. The ant may be 
following a simple rule: get out of the sun and back to the 
nest. Complex behavior does not imply complex mental 
strategies. The same holds for humans. The apparent 
complexity of a man’s behavior over time is largely a 
reflection of the complexity of the environment in which 
he finds himself. People adapt to their environments much 
as gelatin does; if you wish to know what form it will 
have when it solidifies, study the shape of the mold that 
holds the gelatin. To understand behavior, one has to look 
at both the mind and the environment.

When someone asks us, “How does that work?” or 
“Why does that happen?” we tend to answer the question 
directly if we know the answer. After all, it is efficient. 
Another person asks a question; we provide the answer to 
the question. It is usually a win-win. The problem with 
this is that the direct approach can have an unintended 
consequence: the loss of confidence. Although the 
question wanted for an explanation, what the asker 
received was a statement of fact. Why does oil float on 
top of water in a glass? Relative density. What causes 
climate change? Increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Why 
does the ocean have tides? The moon. Giving direct, 
accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the 
problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in 
reality, it can shut the asker down. A statement of fact 
with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take 
the next step. If the asker isn’t familiar with relative 
density or CO2, he or she is likely to move on rather than 
ask a follow-up question or probe for related ideas. Any 
hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost. This is 
a failure in the form of a lost opportunity. Although direct 
answers are often needed and well-placed, they do not 
work universally. A skilled explainer learns to see the 
intent behind the question and formulate an answer that 
focuses on understanding instead of .

(A)
It was my last football game as a college player. I made 
the final tackle and we won. As people chanted my 
name, (a) I was carried off the field on the shoulders of 
my teammates. Although I wasn’t a great student or a 
great football player, I ended up not only graduating from 
my dream university but becoming a hero of the team. 
People keep asking me how I did it. Here is my story.
(B)
It was so hard to break out of the box, but (b) I began 
to feel an urgent need for a change. I signed up for the 
Army and went to the Vietnam War. A lot of people were 
worried, but I said, “Well, I’m going to get out of my box 
by deciding what to do myself instead of having someone 
else tell (c) me what to do.” With that one crucial shift in 
thinking, my whole attitude changed. I began to dream of 
going to one of the best universities in the country and 
playing football. 
(C)
I was born into a large poor family in Chicago. As a kid, 
I had visions of being a hero― a police officer or an 
astronaut. However, people would always tell me, “You 
can’t do that. You aren’t smart enough. You aren’t strong 
enough.” Moreover, (d) I didn’t do well in school, and I had 
no hope of getting into any college. After high school, I 
gave up on my dream of going to college and got a 
part-time job instead. I felt like I was living in a box labeled 
“This is where you belong.” 
(D)
After I finished my time in the Army, I packed my bags 
and went to my dream university. I knocked on the door 
of one of the professors’ offices and said, “Please, tell me 
how to get in here.” The professor could see that I was 
determined. He said, “I can’t let you in the university, but 
(e) I will see you whenever you need my advice or help.” 
It took me a long time, but I eventually got into that 
university, became a football player, and graduated.
