Recently, researchers have suggested that the purpose of 
laughter is not just to communicate that one is in a playful 
state, but to actually induce this state in others as well. 
According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have 
a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional 
arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, 
perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this 
way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of 
coupling together the positive emotions of members of a 
group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would 
explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone 
laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and 
begin laughing too.
