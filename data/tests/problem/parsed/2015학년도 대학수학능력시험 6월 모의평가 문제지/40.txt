An ant turns right, left, and moves ahead over a sandy 
hill. How can we explain the complexity of the path it 
chose? We can think up a sophisticated program in the 
ant’s brain, but it does not work. What we have 
overlooked is the ant’s environment. The ant may be 
following a simple rule: get out of the sun and back to the 
nest. Complex behavior does not imply complex mental 
strategies. The same holds for humans. The apparent 
complexity of a man’s behavior over time is largely a 
reflection of the complexity of the environment in which 
he finds himself. People adapt to their environments much 
as gelatin does; if you wish to know what form it will 
have when it solidifies, study the shape of the mold that 
holds the gelatin. To understand behavior, one has to look 
at both the mind and the environment.
* gelatin: 젤라틴, 정제한 아교
