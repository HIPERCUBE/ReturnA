32. I would like to compare the shift from analog to 
digital film-making to the shift from fresco and tempera 
to oil painting in the early Renaissance. A painter making 
a fresco has limited time before the paint dries, and once 
it has dried, no further changes to the image are possible. 
Similarly, a traditional filmmaker has limited means of 
modifying images once they are recorded on film. 
Medieval tempera painting can be compared to the 
practice of special effects during the analog period of 
cinema. A painter working with tempera could modify 
and rework the image, but the process was painstaking 
and slow. The switch to oils greatly liberated painters by 
allowing them to quickly create much larger compositions 
as well as to modify them as long as necessary. Similarly,
, 
digital technology redefines what can be done with 
cinema. [3점]
① by equating oil painting with analog film-making
② by allowing a filmmaker to treat a film image as an 
oil painting
③ with the shift from oil painting styles to fresco ones 
in making films
④ by integrating fresco painting techniques into the 
film-making process
⑤ with the introduction of tempera painting methods to 
cinematic special effects
