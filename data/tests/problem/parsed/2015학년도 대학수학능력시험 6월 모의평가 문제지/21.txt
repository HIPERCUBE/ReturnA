For many years now, mediated entertainment such as TV 
and film has been able to stimulate our optical and auditory 
senses with sights and sounds. Some forms of new media, 
however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The 
view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on 
the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the 
computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and 
move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and 
rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of 
motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, 
such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the 
California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell 
orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated 
hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of 
emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to 
experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate 
reality by stimulating our senses.
