On the path to excellence, some obstacles may initially 
seem overwhelming. Every performer experiences this feeling, 
even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe 
that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove 
yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly 
impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, 
focusing on what is within your control, taking the first 
step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step 
after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember 
your dream and why it is important to you, find simple 
joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or 
small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing 
learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you 
will get through and find a way through all obstacles.
