(A)
It was my last football game as a college player. I made 
the final tackle and we won. As people chanted my 
name, (a) I was carried off the field on the shoulders of 
my teammates. Although I wasn’t a great student or a 
great football player, I ended up not only graduating from 
my dream university but becoming a hero of the team. 
People keep asking me how I did it. Here is my story.
(B)
It was so hard to break out of the box, but (b) I began 
to feel an urgent need for a change. I signed up for the 
Army and went to the Vietnam War. A lot of people were 
worried, but I said, “Well, I’m going to get out of my box 
by deciding what to do myself instead of having someone 
else tell (c) me what to do.” With that one crucial shift in 
thinking, my whole attitude changed. I began to dream of 
going to one of the best universities in the country and 
playing football. 
(C)
I was born into a large poor family in Chicago. As a kid, 
I had visions of being a hero― a police officer or an 
astronaut. However, people would always tell me, “You 
can’t do that. You aren’t smart enough. You aren’t strong 
enough.” Moreover, (d) I didn’t do well in school, and I had 
no hope of getting into any college. After high school, I 
gave up on my dream of going to college and got a 
part-time job instead. I felt like I was living in a box labeled 
“This is where you belong.” 
(D)
After I finished my time in the Army, I packed my bags 
and went to my dream university. I knocked on the door 
of one of the professors’ offices and said, “Please, tell me 
how to get in here.” The professor could see that I was 
determined. He said, “I can’t let you in the university, but 
(e) I will see you whenever you need my advice or help.” 
It took me a long time, but I eventually got into that 
university, became a football player, and graduated.
