When there is a discrepancy between the verbal message 
and the nonverbal message, the latter typically weighs more 
in forming a judgment. (A) , a friend might react 
to a plan for dinner with a comment like “that’s good,” but 
with little vocal enthusiasm and a muted facial expression. 
In spite of the verbal comment, the lack of expressive 
enthusiasm suggests that the plan isn’t viewed very 
positively. In such a case, the purpose of the positive 
comment might be to avoid a disagreement and support the 
friend, but the lack of a positive expression unintentionally 
leaks a more candid, negative reaction to the plan. Of 
course, the muted expressive display might also be strategic 
and intentional. (B) , the nonverbal message is 
deliberate, but designed to let the partner know one’s candid 
reaction indirectly. It is then the partner’s responsibility to 
interpret the nonverbal message and make some adjustment 
in the plan.
