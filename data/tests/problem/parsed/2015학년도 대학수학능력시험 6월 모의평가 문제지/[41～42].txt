When someone asks us, “How does that work?” or 
“Why does that happen?” we tend to answer the question 
directly if we know the answer. After all, it is efficient. 
Another person asks a question; we provide the answer to 
the question. It is usually a win-win. The problem with 
this is that the direct approach can have an unintended 
consequence: the loss of confidence. Although the 
question wanted for an explanation, what the asker 
received was a statement of fact. Why does oil float on 
top of water in a glass? Relative density. What causes 
climate change? Increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Why 
does the ocean have tides? The moon. Giving direct, 
accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the 
problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in 
reality, it can shut the asker down. A statement of fact 
with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take 
the next step. If the asker isn’t familiar with relative 
density or CO2, he or she is likely to move on rather than 
ask a follow-up question or probe for related ideas. Any 
hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost. This is 
a failure in the form of a lost opportunity. Although direct 
answers are often needed and well-placed, they do not 
work universally. A skilled explainer learns to see the 
intent behind the question and formulate an answer that 
focuses on understanding instead of .
