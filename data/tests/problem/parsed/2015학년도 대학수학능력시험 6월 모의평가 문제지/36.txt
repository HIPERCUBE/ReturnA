36. It is difficult to appreciate what a temperature of 
20,000,000℃ means. ① If the solar surface, not the center, 
were as hot as this, the radiation emitted into space would 
be so great that the whole Earth would be vaporized within 
a few minutes. ② Indeed, this is just what would happen if 
some cosmic giant were to peel off the outer layers of the 
Sun like skinning an orange, for the tremendously hot inner 
regions would then be exposed. ③ It is believed that the 
brightness of the Sun can be predicted theoretically. 
④ Fortunately, no such circumstance is possible, and the 
outer layers of the Sun provide a sort of blanket that protects 
us from its inner fires. ⑤Yet in spite of these blanketing 
layers, some energy must leak through from the Sun’s center 
to its outer regions, and this leakage is of just the right 
amount to compensate for the radiation emitted by the 
surface into surrounding space.
