37.
Mom and Dad went to dinner at a nice restaurant. On 
that first night to myself, Dad entrusted me with his 
movie projector and all the reels of film. 
(A) Then I can play the film backward and watch the cat fly 
down to the floor and see all the splashes of ice cream 
slurp themselves back into the dish. I made Simon jump in 
and out several times before I watched the rest of the film.
(B) He said I could do everything myself that night. So I 
set up the screen at one end of the living room. I turned 
on the projector, turned off the light, put the bowl of 
popcorn in my lap, and settled in to watch the film 
labeled HATTIE-1951.
(C) It’s one of my favorites because my third birthday party 
is on it and I can watch our old cat Simon jump up on 
the dining room table and land in a dish of ice cream.
