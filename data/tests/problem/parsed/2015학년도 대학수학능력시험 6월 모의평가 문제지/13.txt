Dear Ms. Mattie,
Thank you very much for offering me the research 
engineer position at ABC Company. However, after 
a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept 
the position. Your company has an excellent reputation 
as a research institution and has many aspects that 
are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot 
accept your offer because I have decided to pursue 
another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your 
consideration. 
Very truly yours,
Christine Mahoe

Obviously, one of the judgments the public has of us is 
whether or not our telephone service is good. Technically, if 
they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they 
get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. 
They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner 
that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy 
and consideration; and they are in a position to get what 
they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the 
bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and 
fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for 
a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must 
have a philosophy and a method of doing business which 
will allow and insure that its people serve the public 
efficiently and in a pleasing manner.

On the path to excellence, some obstacles may initially 
seem overwhelming. Every performer experiences this feeling, 
even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe 
that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove 
yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly 
impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, 
focusing on what is within your control, taking the first 
step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step 
after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember 
your dream and why it is important to you, find simple 
joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or 
small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing 
learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you 
will get through and find a way through all obstacles.

21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
For many years now, mediated entertainment such as TV 
and film has been able to stimulate our optical and auditory 
senses with sights and sounds. Some forms of new media, 
however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The 
view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on 
the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the 
computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and 
move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and 
rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of 
motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, 
such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the 
California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell 
orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated 
hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of 
emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to 
experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate 
reality by stimulating our senses.

② How We Operate an Audio System
③ Seeing Is More Important Than Touching

Recently, researchers have suggested that the purpose of 
laughter is not just to communicate that one is in a playful 
state, but to actually induce this state in others as well. 
According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have 
a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional 
arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, 
perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this 
way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of 
coupling together the positive emotions of members of a 
group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would 
explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone 
laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and 
begin laughing too.
① effects of laughter on others
② benefits of activating brain circuits
③ strategies for coordinating activities
④ negative aspects of emotional reactions
⑤ importance of grouping in communication

During her childhood years, the artist Tammy Rahr spent 
a lot of time outdoors making things from flowers and dirt. 
Then Tammy and her family moved from the woodlands of 
New York State to an urban city outside of Los Angeles,
