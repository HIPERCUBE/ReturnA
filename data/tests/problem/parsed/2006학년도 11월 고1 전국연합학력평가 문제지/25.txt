25. Richard의 심경 변화를 가장 잘 나타낸 것은?
Richard was traveling cross-country on a train with his 
mother. Early in the trip, he needed to go to the bathroom, 
and after convincing his mother that he was a “big boy” and 
could go to the men’s room by himself, he made his way to 
the bathroom at the far end of the car. On entering, he 
locked the door; the problem was that when he got ready to 
leave, he couldn’t get the door open again. No matter how 
hard he pulled on it, the door wouldn’t move. Against the 
roar and clatter of the train, Richard’s calls for help were 
useless. Panic rose in him, and his cries became desperate 
screams. No one could hear him.
