immigrants seeking their native cuisine, ethnic dining is the 
answer. The most widespread of the ethnic cuisines are 
probably Chinese, Italian, and Mexican. But that is just              
. In New York, Chicago, and many 
other major American cities, the range of ethnic dining goes, if 
not from A to Z, at least from A to Y ― Arabian, American, 
Cuban, Ethiopian, Greek, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, 
Peruvian, Russian, Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese, among many 
other cooking styles. Ethnic influences add variety to 
home-cooked meals, too.
