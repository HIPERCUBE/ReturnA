What is it? It explains how certain characteristics are 
passed on from parents to children. Much of what we know 
about it was discovered by the monk Gregor Mendel in the 
nineteenth century. Since then, the field of it has vastly 
expanded. As scientists study the workings of it, they’ve 
developed new ways of manipulating genes. For example, 
scientists have isolated the gene that makes insulin, a human 
hormone, and now use bacteria to make quantities of it.
① 유전학 ② 심리학 ③ 생태학 ④ 물리학 ⑤ 사회학
19. 다음 글에서 설명하고 있는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? 
If you are outdoors, stay low ― away from open fields or 
tops of mountains. If you are in an open area, get down but 
put as little of your body on the ground as possible; don’t 
lie flat. If you can, stand on your backpack, or whatever you 
have with you that does not conduct electricity (such as 
plastic). Avoid a tree by itself, rain, and picnic shelters. Do 
not stand near metal objects such as flagpoles or metal 
fences. If you are swimming, get out of the water. If you 
are in a car, stay in the car, but don’t touch any metal 
surface. Keep the windows rolled up.
① 등반 요령 ② 절전 방법
③ 낙뢰 대처 요령 ④ 차량 관리 방법
⑤ 화재 예방 방법
20. 글의 분위기로 가장 적절한 것은?
We were on a road that led to a river. There was a long  
line of broken trucks on the road leading up to the bridge. 
No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had 
been blown up in the center; the stone arch was fallen into 
the river. We went on up the bank looking for a place to 
cross. Up ahead I knew there was a railway bridge and I 
thought we might be able to get across there. The path was 
wet and muddy. We could not see anyone; only abandoned 
trucks and stores. 

① 흥겨운 ② 황량한 ③ 긴급한
④ 평화로운 ⑤ 익살스러운  
21. 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
One of my favorite teachers in college taught me the 
single most important lesson I’ve ever learned. “Cultivate 
the mind of a three-year-old,” he commanded. To a 
three-year-old, everything is new, and every day is an 
adventure. Young children don’t spend a lot of time thinking 
about what other people expect of them; they don’t enter 
into situations with preformed ideas of what’s going on and 
what should happen. They have pure minds. And they know 
how to have fun! Ever since that day many years ago, 
I have tried to wake up every morning as a three-year-old. 
I encourage you to try it yourself.
① 남을 먼저 배려하자.
② 치밀한 계획을 세우자.
③ 전문적 식견을 갖추자.
④ 순수한 마음을 갖도록 하자.
⑤ 자신에 대한 기대치를 높이자.
22. 밑줄 친 부분의 어법상 쓰임이 바르지 않은 것은?
Two other communication devices that have come into 
common usage ① are the answering machine and its cousin, 
voice mail. The answering machine gives callers a recorded 
message ② telling them to leave a name and telephone 
number. At one time, many people thought the use of 
answering machines rude. Today, most people ③ consider 
the lack of an answering machine inconsiderate since, 
without it, the caller cannot leave a message for a person 
who is away. Voice mail also provides a message and a 
chance ④ to leave a message. It can be very ⑤ frustrated 
to people who want to speak to an actual person 
immediately.
23. (A), (B), (C)의 네모 안에서 어법에 맞는 표현을 골라 
짝지은 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
I have an acquaintance (A) who / whom calls me by the 
wrong first name. We both grew up in the same town, although 
we didn’t know each other back then. When I first looked him 
up, I introduced myself. Since then, he has been calling me 
George. My name is Jim. Most of the time I see him at the 
weight room at the health club, and he greets me with a big, 
“Hello, George!” I thought about (B) correcting / correction  
him, but he can’t hear me because he has earphones on. 
Sometimes we cross paths in the locker room. He says, 
“How’s it going, George?” and (C)  keep / keeps  on walking.

25. Richard의 심경 변화를 가장 잘 나타낸 것은?
Richard was traveling cross-country on a train with his 
mother. Early in the trip, he needed to go to the bathroom, 
and after convincing his mother that he was a “big boy” and 
could go to the men’s room by himself, he made his way to 
the bathroom at the far end of the car. On entering, he 
locked the door; the problem was that when he got ready to 
leave, he couldn’t get the door open again. No matter how 
hard he pulled on it, the door wouldn’t move. Against the 
roar and clatter of the train, Richard’s calls for help were 
useless. Panic rose in him, and his cries became desperate 
screams. No one could hear him.
① gloomy → happy    ② annoyed → calm
③ worried → relieved    ④ confident → terrified
⑤ disappointed → pleased   

[26~29] 다음 글의 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
26.  Because of rapidly growing economies in the developing 
world and continued growth among the industrialized nations, 
global energy use is climbing. As a result, supplies are 
tight. Prices are rising. And energy users are calling for  
practical alternatives. The good news is we’ve got a huge 
source of alternative energy all around us. It’s called 
conservation and it’s the lowest cost new source of energy 
we have at hand. A reduction of just 5% of global energy 
use would save us the equivalent of over 10 million barrels 
of oil a day. Clearly,                    is like finding it.
① saving energy
② using global energy
③ reducing air pollution
④ developing energy sources
⑤ increasing energy supplies
27.  The fashion of Western footwear has evolved as a 
reflection of                of the period in which it was 
worn. Social status influenced the fashion of footwear just 
as it impacted the arts and architecture. Throughout the 
world, people use the appearance of clothing and accessories 
to communicate rank, age, and special occasion. For 
example, in 14th century England, laws said the permitted 
length of the pointed toe, depending upon social status. 
Heels after their introduction, soon indicated the status of 
the wearer by their height. In fact, the term “well-heeled”, 
which means rich, originated from the wealthy wearing 
high-heeled footwear. 
① positive belief ② social class
③ artistic beauty ④ simple expression
⑤ impressive fashion
28.  For Americans seeking a dining adventure and for 
immigrants seeking their native cuisine, ethnic dining is the 
answer. The most widespread of the ethnic cuisines are 
probably Chinese, Italian, and Mexican. But that is just              
. In New York, Chicago, and many 
other major American cities, the range of ethnic dining goes, if 
not from A to Z, at least from A to Y ― Arabian, American, 
Cuban, Ethiopian, Greek, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, 
Peruvian, Russian, Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese, among many 
other cooking styles. Ethnic influences add variety to 
home-cooked meals, too. 
① the food chain
② the hot potato 
③ a rolling stone
④ a piece of cake
⑤ the tip of the iceberg
29.  Another method of telling other people that space 
belongs to you is                                  . Books, 
papers, and other personal belongings are scattered around 
the site to make it seem more private to others. Students 
often have a small, personal item such as a toy or doll, 
which they place at the edge of their territory (usually the 
edge of the desk). You are basically telling other people 
that the area is yours and that they should stay away. 
Spreading out your belongings is also a well-known trick on 
public transport, where a passenger is trying to give 
impression that the seats next to him are taken. [3점]
① to use your personal markers
② to try to stop your conversation
③ to spend money to your neighbor
④ to give your good first impression
⑤ to reduce your personal belongings

32. 글의 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Probably the fastest-growing part of the Web is called 
e-commerce. ① Most retail businesses have Web sites 
where prospective customers browse among the company’s 
merchandise, finding pictures and prices of the products 
available. ② To order something on the Web, a customer 
fills in an order form with his name, address, credit card 
information, and a list of the products to be purchased. 
③ The customer’s account is charged, and the merchandise 
is delivered to his door. ④ Using the Web, one can look into 
the library. ⑤ Many companies without retail stores have set 
up shop on the Web, and the number of such companies is 
growing rapidly.
33. 글의 흐름으로 보아, 주어진 문장이 들어가기에 가장 적절한 곳은?
Also low-cost airline flights are speeding up the trend. 
People are travelling far from home more than ever before 
in human history. (①) Last year, the number of international 
travellers topped 803 million and the numbers continue to 
rise. (②) Even terrorist attacks in Turkey and the Middle 
East and the Indian Ocean tsunami caused rates to fall only 
briefly. (③) Fear of natural or man-made dangers does not 
seem to reduce the desire to travel. (④) Softer borders 
between countries in the EU have boosted crossings by car, 
bus, and train. (⑤) One airline company recently offered 
round-trip tickets from London to Brest, in France, for less 
than two dollars.

Researchers found that young children understand their 
mother’s stress very quickly and become more stressed 
themselves. The study team questioned mothers having jobs 
about their working conditions and home life. The results 
showed much higher levels of the stress hormone in 
children whose working mothers hated their jobs. The 
stress hormone controls blood pressure and is released by 
the body when people are stressed. Researchers found the 
hormone in the children also greatly increased if their 
mothers were tired after work. In many cases, the stress 
hormone levels were double those of children whose 
mothers enjoyed their job.

In order to improve balance and strength in the legs, I 
suggest you take up the slow-motion exercise combining 
flexibility and lower body strength. Hold the position in 
which all of your weight is on your ① left leg. Your right 
thigh is ② horizontal to the ground. The knee is ③ bent at a 
right angle. Now bring your bent right arm forward, and hold 
it in position a few inches ④ above the knee. In this 
position, the ⑤ straightened right elbow and right knee

36.  Crying is a way for the baby to get what it wants and, 
as adults, this behavior is still continued by some women. 
Women’s tear hormones are more active than men’s, which 
is consistent with the greater emotional responses of the 
female brain. Men are rarely seen crying in public because a 
man showing emotion, around other men, would be put at 
risk. He’d look weak and this would encourage others to 
attack. For women to show emotion to others, however, is 
seen as a sign of trust because the cryer becomes the baby 
and is putting her friend into the role of protective parent.
① Crying in Public
② Emotional Responses
③ What the Sign of Trust Is
④ Why Women Cry More Than Men
⑤ When We Need Protective Parents
37.  Benjamin Franklin did many things during his long life. 
But not many people know he was also a swimmer. He 
swam in the ocean near Boston, Massachusetts. The water 
was extremely cold, so he designed and wore a wetsuit. 
The wetsuit kept him warm. People use wetsuits today. For 
example, scuba divers wear wetsuits to stay warm for a 
long time in very cold water. Franklin got an another idea 
about a new sport from flying his kite. Standing by a small 
lake, he thought that a person could hold one end of a rope 
tied to a really big kite. The kite could pull the person 
across the water. He tried it and it worked. Today 
windsurfers use a big sail to pull themselves across the 
water.

② The Weather and Sports
③ The Origin of Scuba Diving
④ A Wetsuit for All Purposes
⑤ A Swimmer and Sports Inventor
38. Stephanie의 직업으로 가장 적절한 것은?
In Stephanie’s magic box, there are pleasant dreams of 
youth and beauty. There are bad dreams of growing old and 
ugly. And there are terrifying nightmares of turning into a 
demon. Stephanie delivers these and other transformations 
with the aid of latex, wigs, powders, and pots or tubes of 
color. Her work lets the mature actress play a young 
woman, and it allows an actor to become 50 years older in 
scenes just a few minutes apart on screen. The script may 
call for a famous person from the past, such as a queen or 
a president. Then it’s Stephanie’s job to transform the actor 
into a convincing likeness of the character.

Before selecting a school, 
students should consider these questions:
□ Does the school have a major in your field of interest?
□ Does school program have a good reputation?
□ Are you likely to be accepted at the school, considering 
your grades and test scores?
□ Which environment do you prefer―a big city, a small 
town, or rural area?
□ Can you afford the tuition and living expenses at this 
school? Could you get as good an education elsewhere for 
a lot less money?

40. Peter에 대한 설명 중, 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The son of the novelist Nathaniel Benchley and the 
grandson of celebrated humorist Robert Benchley, Peter was 
raised in a world of words. He grew up spending summers 
on Nantucket, and after earning a degree in English from 
Harvard, Peter returned to the island. One summer night, he 
met Wendy Wesson at the Jared Coffin House, an inn that 
was the social center of Nantucket. Two weeks later they 
decided to get married. Wendy, their three children, Tracy, 
Clayton, and Christopher, and their five grand children all 
shared Peter’s enthusiasm for the ocean, how it works and 
how to protect it. The love of the sea flowed through the 
Benchley family.

41.  People are interacting on the international stage for 
both work and business purposes and it is often the case 
that intercultural misunderstandings lead to negative results. 
There have been tourists receiving unfriendly reactions by 
natives or business personnel losing deals. In many 
instances the cause has been cultural, such as wearing 
inappropriate clothing in a conservative culture or approaching 
a business relationship too casually. In short, intercultural 
awareness is a skill needed by anyone mixing with people 
from different cultural backgrounds.
① the purpose of education
② the characteristics of culture
③ the process of mutual agreement
④ the importance of traditional culture
⑤ the necessity of intercultural awareness
42.  Clearly, the concept of health has changed in recent 
years. Young people no longer view health as an absence of 
illness, that is not being sick, but rather as something which 
can be judged for the way a person looks. Also, young 
people understand health mainly in terms of external factors: 
physical appearance ― especially good skin, hair and teeth 
― and slimness. Young people are increasingly willing to 
achieve these features with a low impact lifestyle ― 
treatment, medicines and dietary supplements.

You know, if anybody deserves a medal for brave effort 
and accomplishment, it’s Joanna. I remember when she went 
back to running the hurdles after her accident. In spite of 
the pain she suffered from her injuries, she kept on 
exercising until she was able to run again. She would not 
allow herself to accept defeat. During the course of her 
recovery, she often stumbled and fell and many people 
thought she would never be able to run again. But Joanna 
fooled them all! She kept working until she achieved her 
goal!

44. 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
It is important to remember that simply setting aside time 
to study will not insure that students will do well 
academically. It is just as important to make efficient use of 
that study time. For example, setting aside three hours to 
read a chapter is a waste of time if one doesn’t understand 
or remember what one has read. Similarly, spending ten 
hours simply reading over notes in order to prepare for an 
exam is probably not going to land an “A”. In short, doing 
well in school depends on setting aside time to study and 
using that time effectively.

On the surface, effective listening might seem to require 
little more than an acute sense of hearing. But,   (A)  , 
there is a big difference between hearing and listening. 
Hearing occurs when sound waves travel through the air, 
enter your ears, and are transmitted by the auditory nerve 
to your brain. As long as neither your brain nor your ears 
are impaired, hearing is involuntary. It occurs spontaneously with 
little conscious effort on your part. Listening,    (B)   , is 
a voluntary act that includes attending to, understanding, and 
evaluating the words or sounds you hear.

[47~48] 다음 글을 읽고 물음에 답하시오.
Michael is a first-year student at a high school. During 
the first few weeks of class he is asked to participate in a 
variety of activities, each of ⓐ which takes away from his 
study time. When given the choice between going to the 
movies and reading a chapter of Social Studies, Michael 
almost always picks the movies. He tells ⓑhimself “I’ll catch 
up later.” He doesn’t realize that each time he makes such 
a choice, he will suffer from the consequences in due time. 
As the term continues, the consequences begin to appear. 
He completes a Philosophy paper an hour before class, but 
can’t get it ⓒprinted in time. The consequences become 
more and more serious. As the term comes to a close, 
Michael is rushing to start research papers, to complete 
assigned readings, and to prepare for final exams. He has 
trouble sleeping. He feels overwhelmed by the amount of 
work he needs to complete. Tension causes him ⓓ eating 
poorly. He blanks out on his Chemistry final. Michael’s 
grades for the term are lower than he had expected when 
he started the term, and they are much lower than his 
middle school grades. A similar chain of events occurs the 
next term. Thinking he can’t handle high school life, Michael 
becomes ⓔ depressed and considers leaving school.

Natasha spent weeks working on an oil painting. She 
applied layers of color, then waited for the paint to dry 
before adding more layers of color. Under her brush, a 
peaceful woodland scene slowly grew. Finally she put the 
last touches of paint on the canvas and set down her 
brush.
While Natasha put the finishing touches on her painting, 
her brother Andrew sat in front of a computer screen. 
Using his computer’s painting tools, he chose line widths 
and brush strokes. He selected colors and shades. With 
movements and clicks of Andrew’s mouse, a stormy ocean 
scene quickly grew. With a tap of his finger, Andrew sent 
the image to his printer.
“What do you think, Mom?” Natasha proudly presented 
her painting to her mother.
“How about my artwork, Mom?” Andrew held up the 
color printout of his creation.
“My painting took weeks!” said Natasha. “His took just a 
couple of hours. You can’t call that art!”
“I think you are both terrific artists,” their mother said 
diplomatically. “It doesn’t matter how long it took or what 
tools you used. You’ve both expressed your emotions and 
your ideas in your work, and that’s what makes it art.”
