Natasha spent weeks working on an oil painting. She 
applied layers of color, then waited for the paint to dry 
before adding more layers of color. Under her brush, a 
peaceful woodland scene slowly grew. Finally she put the 
last touches of paint on the canvas and set down her 
brush.
While Natasha put the finishing touches on her painting, 
her brother Andrew sat in front of a computer screen. 
Using his computer’s painting tools, he chose line widths 
and brush strokes. He selected colors and shades. With 
movements and clicks of Andrew’s mouse, a stormy ocean 
scene quickly grew. With a tap of his finger, Andrew sent 
the image to his printer.
“What do you think, Mom?” Natasha proudly presented 
her painting to her mother.
“How about my artwork, Mom?” Andrew held up the 
color printout of his creation.
“My painting took weeks!” said Natasha. “His took just a 
couple of hours. You can’t call that art!”
“I think you are both terrific artists,” their mother said 
diplomatically. “It doesn’t matter how long it took or what 
tools you used. You’ve both expressed your emotions and 
your ideas in your work, and that’s what makes it art.”
