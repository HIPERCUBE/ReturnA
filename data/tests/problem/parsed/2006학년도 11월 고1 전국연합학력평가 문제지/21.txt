One of my favorite teachers in college taught me the 
single most important lesson I’ve ever learned. “Cultivate 
the mind of a three-year-old,” he commanded. To a 
three-year-old, everything is new, and every day is an 
adventure. Young children don’t spend a lot of time thinking 
about what other people expect of them; they don’t enter 
into situations with preformed ideas of what’s going on and 
what should happen. They have pure minds. And they know 
how to have fun! Ever since that day many years ago, 
I have tried to wake up every morning as a three-year-old. 
I encourage you to try it yourself.
