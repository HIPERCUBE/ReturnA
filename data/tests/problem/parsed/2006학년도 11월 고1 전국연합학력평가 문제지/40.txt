40. Peter에 대한 설명 중, 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The son of the novelist Nathaniel Benchley and the 
grandson of celebrated humorist Robert Benchley, Peter was 
raised in a world of words. He grew up spending summers 
on Nantucket, and after earning a degree in English from 
Harvard, Peter returned to the island. One summer night, he 
met Wendy Wesson at the Jared Coffin House, an inn that 
was the social center of Nantucket. Two weeks later they 
decided to get married. Wendy, their three children, Tracy, 
Clayton, and Christopher, and their five grand children all 
shared Peter’s enthusiasm for the ocean, how it works and 
how to protect it. The love of the sea flowed through the 
Benchley family.
