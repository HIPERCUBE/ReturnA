If you are outdoors, stay low ― away from open fields or 
tops of mountains. If you are in an open area, get down but 
put as little of your body on the ground as possible; don’t 
lie flat. If you can, stand on your backpack, or whatever you 
have with you that does not conduct electricity (such as 
plastic). Avoid a tree by itself, rain, and picnic shelters. Do 
not stand near metal objects such as flagpoles or metal 
fences. If you are swimming, get out of the water. If you 
are in a car, stay in the car, but don’t touch any metal 
surface. Keep the windows rolled up.
