[47~48] 다음 글을 읽고 물음에 답하시오.
Michael is a first-year student at a high school. During 
the first few weeks of class he is asked to participate in a 
variety of activities, each of ⓐ which takes away from his 
study time. When given the choice between going to the 
movies and reading a chapter of Social Studies, Michael 
almost always picks the movies. He tells ⓑhimself “I’ll catch 
up later.” He doesn’t realize that each time he makes such 
a choice, he will suffer from the consequences in due time. 
As the term continues, the consequences begin to appear. 
He completes a Philosophy paper an hour before class, but 
can’t get it ⓒprinted in time. The consequences become 
more and more serious. As the term comes to a close, 
Michael is rushing to start research papers, to complete 
assigned readings, and to prepare for final exams. He has 
trouble sleeping. He feels overwhelmed by the amount of 
work he needs to complete. Tension causes him ⓓ eating 
poorly. He blanks out on his Chemistry final. Michael’s 
grades for the term are lower than he had expected when 
he started the term, and they are much lower than his 
middle school grades. A similar chain of events occurs the 
next term. Thinking he can’t handle high school life, Michael 
becomes ⓔ depressed and considers leaving school.
