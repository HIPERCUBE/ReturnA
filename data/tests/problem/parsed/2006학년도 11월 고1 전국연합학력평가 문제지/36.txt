36.  Crying is a way for the baby to get what it wants and, 
as adults, this behavior is still continued by some women. 
Women’s tear hormones are more active than men’s, which 
is consistent with the greater emotional responses of the 
female brain. Men are rarely seen crying in public because a 
man showing emotion, around other men, would be put at 
risk. He’d look weak and this would encourage others to 
attack. For women to show emotion to others, however, is 
seen as a sign of trust because the cryer becomes the baby 
and is putting her friend into the role of protective parent.
