37.  Benjamin Franklin did many things during his long life. 
But not many people know he was also a swimmer. He 
swam in the ocean near Boston, Massachusetts. The water 
was extremely cold, so he designed and wore a wetsuit. 
The wetsuit kept him warm. People use wetsuits today. For 
example, scuba divers wear wetsuits to stay warm for a 
long time in very cold water. Franklin got an another idea 
about a new sport from flying his kite. Standing by a small 
lake, he thought that a person could hold one end of a rope 
tied to a really big kite. The kite could pull the person 
across the water. He tried it and it worked. Today 
windsurfers use a big sail to pull themselves across the 
water.
