I have an acquaintance (A) who / whom calls me by the 
wrong first name. We both grew up in the same town, although 
we didn’t know each other back then. When I first looked him 
up, I introduced myself. Since then, he has been calling me 
George. My name is Jim. Most of the time I see him at the 
weight room at the health club, and he greets me with a big, 
“Hello, George!” I thought about (B) correcting / correction
