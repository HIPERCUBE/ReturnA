In order to improve balance and strength in the legs, I 
suggest you take up the slow-motion exercise combining 
flexibility and lower body strength. Hold the position in 
which all of your weight is on your ① left leg. Your right 
thigh is ② horizontal to the ground. The knee is ③ bent at a 
right angle. Now bring your bent right arm forward, and hold 
it in position a few inches ④ above the knee. In this 
position, the ⑤ straightened right elbow and right knee 
should not quite touch.
