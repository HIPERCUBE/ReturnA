22. 밑줄 친 부분의 어법상 쓰임이 바르지 않은 것은?
Two other communication devices that have come into 
common usage ① are the answering machine and its cousin, 
voice mail. The answering machine gives callers a recorded 
message ② telling them to leave a name and telephone 
number. At one time, many people thought the use of 
answering machines rude. Today, most people ③ consider 
the lack of an answering machine inconsiderate since, 
without it, the caller cannot leave a message for a person 
who is away. Voice mail also provides a message and a 
chance ④ to leave a message. It can be very ⑤ frustrated 
to people who want to speak to an actual person 
immediately.
