Researchers found that young children understand their 
mother’s stress very quickly and become more stressed 
themselves. The study team questioned mothers having jobs 
about their working conditions and home life. The results 
showed much higher levels of the stress hormone in 
children whose working mothers hated their jobs. The 
stress hormone controls blood pressure and is released by 
the body when people are stressed. Researchers found the 
hormone in the children also greatly increased if their 
mothers were tired after work. In many cases, the stress 
hormone levels were double those of children whose 
mothers enjoyed their job.
