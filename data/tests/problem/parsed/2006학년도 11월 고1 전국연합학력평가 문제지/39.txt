39. 학교를 선택할 때에 고려할 사항으로 언급되지 않은 것은?
Before selecting a school, 
students should consider these questions:
□ Does the school have a major in your field of interest?
□ Does school program have a good reputation?
□ Are you likely to be accepted at the school, considering 
your grades and test scores?
□ Which environment do you prefer―a big city, a small 
town, or rural area?
□ Can you afford the tuition and living expenses at this 
school? Could you get as good an education elsewhere for 
a lot less money?
