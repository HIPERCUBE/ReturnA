On the surface, effective listening might seem to require 
little more than an acute sense of hearing. But,   (A)  , 
there is a big difference between hearing and listening. 
Hearing occurs when sound waves travel through the air, 
enter your ears, and are transmitted by the auditory nerve 
to your brain. As long as neither your brain nor your ears 
are impaired, hearing is involuntary. It occurs spontaneously with 
little conscious effort on your part. Listening,    (B)   , is 
a voluntary act that includes attending to, understanding, and 
evaluating the words or sounds you hear.

[49~50] 다음 글을 읽고 물음에 답하시오.
Natasha spent weeks working on an oil painting. She 
applied layers of color, then waited for the paint to dry 
before adding more layers of color. Under her brush, a 
peaceful woodland scene slowly grew. Finally she put the 
last touches of paint on the canvas and set down her 
brush.
While Natasha put the finishing touches on her painting, 
her brother Andrew sat in front of a computer screen. 
Using his computer’s painting tools, he chose line widths 
and brush strokes. He selected colors and shades. With 
movements and clicks of Andrew’s mouse, a stormy ocean 
scene quickly grew. With a tap of his finger, Andrew sent 
the image to his printer.
“What do you think, Mom?” Natasha proudly presented 
her painting to her mother.
“How about my artwork, Mom?” Andrew held up the 
color printout of his creation.
“My painting took weeks!” said Natasha. “His took just a 
couple of hours. You can’t call that art!”
“I think you are both terrific artists,” their mother said 
diplomatically. “It doesn’t matter how long it took or what 
tools you used. You’ve both expressed your emotions and 
your ideas in your work, and that’s what makes it art.”
