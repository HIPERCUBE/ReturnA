It is important to remember that simply setting aside time 
to study will not insure that students will do well 
academically. It is just as important to make efficient use of 
that study time. For example, setting aside three hours to 
read a chapter is a waste of time if one doesn’t understand 
or remember what one has read. Similarly, spending ten 
hours simply reading over notes in order to prepare for an 
exam is probably not going to land an “A”. In short, doing 
well in school depends on setting aside time to study and 
using that time effectively.
