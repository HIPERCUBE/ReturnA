26.  Because of rapidly growing economies in the developing 
world and continued growth among the industrialized nations, 
global energy use is climbing. As a result, supplies are 
tight. Prices are rising. And energy users are calling for  
practical alternatives. The good news is we’ve got a huge 
source of alternative energy all around us. It’s called 
conservation and it’s the lowest cost new source of energy 
we have at hand. A reduction of just 5% of global energy 
use would save us the equivalent of over 10 million barrels 
of oil a day. Clearly,                    is like finding it.
