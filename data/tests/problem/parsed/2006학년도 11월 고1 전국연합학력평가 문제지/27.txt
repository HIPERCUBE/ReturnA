27.  The fashion of Western footwear has evolved as a 
reflection of                of the period in which it was 
worn. Social status influenced the fashion of footwear just 
as it impacted the arts and architecture. Throughout the 
world, people use the appearance of clothing and accessories 
to communicate rank, age, and special occasion. For 
example, in 14th century England, laws said the permitted 
length of the pointed toe, depending upon social status. 
Heels after their introduction, soon indicated the status of 
the wearer by their height. In fact, the term “well-heeled”, 
which means rich, originated from the wealthy wearing 
high-heeled footwear.
