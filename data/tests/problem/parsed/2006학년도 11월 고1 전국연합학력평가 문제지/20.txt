We were on a road that led to a river. There was a long  
line of broken trucks on the road leading up to the bridge. 
No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had 
been blown up in the center; the stone arch was fallen into 
the river. We went on up the bank looking for a place to 
cross. Up ahead I knew there was a railway bridge and I 
thought we might be able to get across there. The path was 
wet and muddy. We could not see anyone; only abandoned 
trucks and stores.
