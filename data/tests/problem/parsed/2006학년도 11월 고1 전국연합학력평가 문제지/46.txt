On the surface, effective listening might seem to require 
little more than an acute sense of hearing. But,   (A)  , 
there is a big difference between hearing and listening. 
Hearing occurs when sound waves travel through the air, 
enter your ears, and are transmitted by the auditory nerve 
to your brain. As long as neither your brain nor your ears 
are impaired, hearing is involuntary. It occurs spontaneously with 
little conscious effort on your part. Listening,    (B)   , is 
a voluntary act that includes attending to, understanding, and 
evaluating the words or sounds you hear.
