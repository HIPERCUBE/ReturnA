Colored flags are used to give important signals to drivers 
during auto races. ① The green flag means “start” or 
“continue,” and the yellow flag tells drivers to slow down and 
hold position. ② The red flag is a signal to stop, and when 
drivers see the black flag, they know they must pull into the 
pit area immediately. ③ A blue flag with yellow stripes is 
used to tell slower drivers to pull over and allow the leaders 
to pass. ④ Flags are used to represent organizations and 
groups of people such as the Olympic flag and the flag of 
the United Nations. ⑤ The two favorite flags of most drivers 
are: the white flag, which means “one lap to go,” and the 
checkered flag, which means “you have reached the finish.”
