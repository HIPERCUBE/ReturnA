People with low self­esteem often see themselves as 
inadequate or feel like victims.
(A) If that is true of you, then you can combat those 
feelings by serving others. Making a difference ― even a 
small one ― in the lives of other people lifts one’s 
self­esteem.
(B) In addition to that, adding value to others makes them 
value you more. It creates a cycle of positive feeling 
from one person to another.
(C) They focus excessively on themselves. They can become 
self­protective and selfish because they feel that they 
have to be to survive.

The economists, Alexander Mas and Enrico Moretti 
could get access to every detail about the productivity of 
a supermarket chain’s cashiers. Using the computerized 
records from the stores’ scanners, they could track 
every “bleep,” every transaction, for 370 cashiers in six 
stores for two years. They could measure each cashier’s 
productivity by the second, and note how it changed 
depending on who else was working at the same time.
Mas and Moretti wanted to find out whether people 
work harder if they are                           . The 
answer is yes: When a quick worker sits next to you, 
you immediately start scanning your items more quickly. 
And you do so because you don’t want to be accused of 
not working hard, rather than because you are inspired 
by their speed. Mas and Moretti know this because they 
observed the way that supermarket checkout aisles are 
arranged: Each worker is looking at a co­worker’s back, 
with his or her own back being watched by a different 
co­worker. Mas and Moretti found that checkout staff do 
not speed up when they are looking at fast colleagues. 
They only speed up when fast colleagues are looking at 
them.
