Dear Mayor Stevenson: afa
I am writing to inform you about the situation of my b
son’s school due to the budget cuts. Since the cuts re
were made, the number of police officers on duty to c
direct traffic at Central Elementary School during the c
afternoons has decreased from two to one. Many p
parents are greatly concerned for the safety of our h
children as they walk through the area that we once a
considered safe. Central is now the only elementary w
school in the district that does not have a police ①
officer at every entrance. We find this fact to be very ②
unfair. We need one additional police officer who can ③
make sure that our children make their way home ④
safely. ⑤
Thank you for your prompt attention in advance.
Sincerely,
Juliet Darcy
