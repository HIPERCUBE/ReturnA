[43 ∼ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. ①
(A) ②
There was a sign in a store window, which said, “Boy ③
wanted.” A boy named Crawford Hill walked into the ④
store, applied for the job, and was hired. Mr. Peters, the ⑤
store owner, instructed (a) him to go into the attic of 
the building. “You will find a long, deep box up there,” 
he said. “I want you to sort through the contents and 
see what should be saved.”
(B)
If (b) he didn’t report finding the money, how could Mr. 
Peters trust him with the cash register? By finishing the 
job in the hot attic and giving the money to his boss rather 
than pocketing it, Crawford proved that (c) he was both 
faithful and honest. Years later, when Mr. Peters retired, 
he turned his business over to Crawford to manage.
(C)
The boy went into the attic and began sorting 
through the old box of junk. The attic was hot, but 
Crawford spent hours looking through the box, 
separating usable nails and screws from things that 
should be thrown away. When he picked up one of the 
last items in the box, (d) he noticed a twenty­dollar 
bill lying on the bottom. He grabbed the bill, raced 
downstairs, and said, “Look, Mr. Peters! Look what I 
found in the box ― twenty dollars!”
(D)
Then he handed the money to his boss. Mr. Peters 
smiled because he knew that he could trust the boy to 
work in his store. The old junk box was merely a test. 
Mr. Peters had filled it with nails, screws, and other 
items to test his employee’s faithfulness. (e) He wanted 
to see if the boy would complete the job and keep a 
good attitude, even though he didn’t understand why he 
was doing seemingly useless work. Mr. Peters had also 
planted a twenty­dollar bill at the bottom of the box to 
test his employee’s honesty.
