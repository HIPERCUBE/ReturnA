27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Don’t be afraid to move around and try different things, 
① however old you are. The most important thing you want 
to find out is who you are and what capabilities you have. 
Give yourself a time limit to dig into yourself and find out 
② what you need. In this period, there is no way around it, 
so you have to be a risk taker. If you don’t take any risks, 
you don’t get any sweetness out of life. And the truth of 
the matter is that the sweetness in life ③ comes with the 
risk. I’ve lived my life ④ taking risks and I wish I could tell 
you they were all successful, but they weren’t. But you 
want to know something? I learned more from my failures 
than I ⑤ was from my successes.
