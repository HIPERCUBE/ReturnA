When two monkeys are trapped together in a small cage, 
they try everything they can to (A) prevent / start  a fight. 
Moving with caution and suppressing any behaviors that could 
trigger aggression are good short­term solutions to the 
problem. The monkeys sit in a corner and avoid any random 
movements; even a brief touch could be interpreted as the 
beginning of (B) generous / hostile  action. Mutual eye contact 
is also dangerous because, in monkey language, staring is a 
threat. The monkeys look up in the air or at the ground, or ①
stare at some imaginary point outside the cage. But as time ②
passes, sitting still and pretending (C) authority / indifference  ③
are no longer sufficient strategies to keep the situation under ④
control. To avoid aggression and to reduce stress, an act of ⑤
communication is needed to make it clear to the other 
monkey that no harm is intended.

People with low self­esteem often see themselves as 
inadequate or feel like victims.
A) If that is true of you, then you can combat those 
feelings by serving others. Making a difference ― even a 
small one ― in the lives of other people lifts one’s 
self­esteem.
B) In addition to that, adding value to others makes them 
value you more. It creates a cycle of positive feeling 
from one person to another.

The economists, Alexander Mas and Enrico Moretti 
could get access to every detail about the productivity of 
a supermarket chain’s cashiers. Using the computerized 
records from the stores’ scanners, they could track 
every “bleep,” every transaction, for 370 cashiers in six 
stores for two years. They could measure each cashier’s 
productivity by the second, and note how it changed 
depending on who else was working at the same time.
Mas and Moretti wanted to find out whether people 
work harder if they are                           . The 
answer is yes: When a quick worker sits next to you, 
you immediately start scanning your items more quickly. 
And you do so because you don’t want to be accused of 
not working hard, rather than because you are inspired 
by their speed. Mas and Moretti know this because they 
observed the way that supermarket checkout aisles are 
arranged: Each worker is looking at a co­worker’s back, 
with his or her own back being watched by a different 
co­worker. Mas and Moretti found that checkout staff do 
not speed up when they are looking at fast colleagues. 
They only speed up when fast colleagues are looking at 
them.

There was a sign in a store window, which said, “Boy ③
wanted.” A boy named Crawford Hill walked into the ④
store, applied for the job, and was hired. Mr. Peters, the ⑤
store owner, instructed (a) him to go into the attic of 
the building. “You will find a long, deep box up there,” 
he said. “I want you to sort through the contents and 
see what should be saved.”
(B)
If (b) he didn’t report finding the money, how could Mr. 
Peters trust him with the cash register? By finishing the 
job in the hot attic and giving the money to his boss rather 
than pocketing it, Crawford proved that (c) he was both 
faithful and honest. Years later, when Mr. Peters retired, 
he turned his business over to Crawford to manage.
(C)
The boy went into the attic and began sorting 
through the old box of junk. The attic was hot, but 
Crawford spent hours looking through the box, 
separating usable nails and screws from things that 
should be thrown away. When he picked up one of the 
last items in the box, (d) he noticed a twenty­dollar 
bill lying on the bottom. He grabbed the bill, raced 
downstairs, and said, “Look, Mr. Peters! Look what I 
found in the box ― twenty dollars!”
(D)
Then he handed the money to his boss. Mr. Peters 
smiled because he knew that he could trust the boy to 
work in his store. The old junk box was merely a test. 
Mr. Peters had filled it with nails, screws, and other 
items to test his employee’s faithfulness. (e) He wanted 
to see if the boy would complete the job and keep a 
good attitude, even though he didn’t understand why he 
was doing seemingly useless work. Mr. Peters had also 
planted a twenty­dollar bill at the bottom of the box to 
test his employee’s honesty.
