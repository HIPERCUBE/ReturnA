Dear Mayor Stevenson: afa
I am writing to inform you about the situation of my b
son’s school due to the budget cuts. Since the cuts re
were made, the number of police officers on duty to c
direct traffic at Central Elementary School during the c
afternoons has decreased from two to one. Many p
parents are greatly concerned for the safety of our h
children as they walk through the area that we once a
considered safe. Central is now the only elementary w
school in the district that does not have a police ①
officer at every entrance. We find this fact to be very ②
unfair. We need one additional police officer who can ③
make sure that our children make their way home ④
safely. ⑤
Thank you for your prompt attention in advance.

Most universities have students fill out an evaluation of 
very course they take. The results are often made publicly 
vailable and can be a good guide to the best classes. In 
ct, a large number of studies have shown some of the 
enefits of these evaluations. In the first place, they are 
liable; students tend to agree with each other on which 
lasses are good and even ten years later still rate the same 
lasses highly. They also appear to be correlated with 
erformance; students perform better in classes they rate 
ighly. In one study, two professors taught the same class

When two monkeys are trapped together in a small cage, 
they try everything they can to (A) prevent / start  a fight. 
Moving with caution and suppressing any behaviors that could

problem. The monkeys sit in a corner and avoid any random 
movements; even a brief touch could be interpreted as the 
beginning of (B) generous / hostile  action. Mutual eye contact 
is also dangerous because, in monkey language, staring is a

stare at some imaginary point outside the cage. But as time ②

The economists, Alexander Mas and Enrico Moretti 
could get access to every detail about the productivity of 
a supermarket chain’s cashiers. Using the computerized 
records from the stores’ scanners, they could track 
every “bleep,” every transaction, for 370 cashiers in six 
stores for two years. They could measure each cashier’s 
productivity by the second, and note how it changed 
depending on who else was working at the same time.
Mas and Moretti wanted to find out whether people 
work harder if they are                           . The 
answer is yes: When a quick worker sits next to you, 
you immediately start scanning your items more quickly. 
And you do so because you don’t want to be accused of 
not working hard, rather than because you are inspired 
by their speed. Mas and Moretti know this because they 
observed the way that supermarket checkout aisles are 
arranged: Each worker is looking at a co­worker’s back, 
with his or her own back being watched by a different 
co­worker. Mas and Moretti found that checkout staff do 
not speed up when they are looking at fast colleagues. 
They only speed up when fast colleagues are looking at 
them.

Peters trust him with the cash register? By finishing the 
job in the hot attic and giving the money to his boss rather 
than pocketing it, Crawford proved that (c) he was both 
faithful and honest. Years later, when Mr. Peters retired, 
he turned his business over to Crawford to manage.
(C)
The boy went into the attic and began sorting 
through the old box of junk. The attic was hot, but 
Crawford spent hours looking through the box, 
separating usable nails and screws from things that 
should be thrown away. When he picked up one of the 
last items in the box, (d) he noticed a twenty­dollar 
bill lying on the bottom. He grabbed the bill, raced 
downstairs, and said, “Look, Mr. Peters! Look what I 
found in the box ― twenty dollars!”
(D)
Then he handed the money to his boss. Mr. Peters 
smiled because he knew that he could trust the boy to 
work in his store. The old junk box was merely a test. 
Mr. Peters had filled it with nails, screws, and other 
items to test his employee’s faithfulness. (e) He wanted 
to see if the boy would complete the job and keep a 
good attitude, even though he didn’t understand why he 
was doing seemingly useless work. Mr. Peters had also 
planted a twenty­dollar bill at the bottom of the box to 
test his employee’s honesty.
