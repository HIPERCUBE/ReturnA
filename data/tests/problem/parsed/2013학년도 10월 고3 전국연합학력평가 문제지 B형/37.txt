37. An automobile is a commodity that can be relocated 
anywhere. Its value is determined by the supply and 
demand for a particular model, based on upgrades and 
condition. (A)  , if two 2004 Speero cars were 
available for sale and had identical upgrades and mileage, 
the vehicle in poorer condition would be priced lower. A 
home’s value is also determined by the supply and demand 
for the home, based on the model of the home, upgrades, 
and the current state of the home ― in other words, 
whether it is in good shape. But there is one large 
difference between a car and a home. A home cannot 
travel. It is firmly rooted where it is built. (B)  , a 
home’s value, unlike the automobile’s, is as dependent on 
its location as on its characteristics and amenities. Even if 
a home is in excellent condition, if the neighborhood in 
which it resides deteriorates, so will the value of the 
home.
