27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
With all the passion for being slim, it is no wonder ① that 
many people view any amount of visible fat on the body as 
something to get rid of. However, the human body has 
evolved over time in environments of food scarcity; hence, 
the ability to store fat ② efficiently is a valuable physiological 
function that served our ancestors well for thousands of 
years. Only in the last few decades, in the primarily 
industrially developed economies, ③ have food become so 
plentiful and easy to obtain as to cause fat­related health 
problems. People no longer have to spend most of their time 
and energy ④ gathering berries and seeds and hoping that a 
hunting party will return with meat. All we have to do 
nowadays is drive to the supermarket or the fast­food 
restaurant, ⑤ where for very low cost we can obtain nearly 
all of our daily calories.
