Instead, look for watermelons that are symmetrical, are 
heavy for their size, and have a creamy yellow spot on 
the bottom.
When faced with a bunch of watermelons, all promising 
delicious juiciness inside, how do you know which one to 
pick? ( ① ) It is suggested that you skip the tapping and 
instead check the bottom of the watermelon. ( ② ) Tapping 
a watermelon like a bongo might work for some people, but 
it’s too subjective. ( ③ ) And there’s no agreement on 
whether a watermelon is supposed to sound “solid” or “tight” 
or even make a b­flat sound. ( ④ ) This is where the 
watermelon sat on the ground while it soaked up the sun at 
the farm. ( ⑤ ) If this spot is white or greenish, your 
watermelon may have been picked too soon and might not be 
as ripe as it should be.
