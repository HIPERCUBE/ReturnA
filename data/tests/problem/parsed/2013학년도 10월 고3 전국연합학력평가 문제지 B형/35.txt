35. No animal surpasses humans in                          , 
and we’ve been doing it for a long time. The “Iceman,” 
whose 5,200­year­old corpse was discovered on a glacier on 
the Italian­Austrian border, had stuffed grasses into his 
shoes to keep his feet warm and was carrying a sloe berry. 
Human transport of plants increased abundantly as our 
transportation technology developed. People transported and 
introduced some non­native species intentionally, for food, 
fiber, medicine, ornament or scientific curiosity. Seeds of 
other plants were introduced accidentally in sacks of seed 
grain, wool or cotton, or in mud stuck to machinery. Human 
activities like farming, irrigation, forestry and mining have 
made it easier for these non­native species to become 
established by removing native vegetation, disturbing the soil 
and altering the availability of water and nutrients.
