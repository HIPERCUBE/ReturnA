36. “Sand,” “rich,” “oil,” and “Bedouin” are all stereotypes about 
Arabs. Some people imagine the Arab World as a giant 
desert, with cities and villages scattered randomly throughout. 
Though a conventional image of many people, this is, of 
course, a very (A)  picture of the region. There are 
vast deserts in the Arab World, and in parts of those deserts 
Bedouins and nomads live. However, supposing that this 
predominates would be like saying that the United States is 
made up of country towns run by cowboys. The topography 
and climate of the Arab World are as (B) as its 
people. There are beaches, dense forests, mountains that are 
snowcapped year­round, large metropolises, and every 
imaginable climate. Moreover, not every Arab country 
possesses oil. There are potentially more oil reserves in 
Alaska than in Saudi Arabia. The stereotype of the oil­rich 
Arab leads to assumptions of the financially rich Arab. There 
are rich Arabs just as there are rich Americans and other 
rich people all over the world. [3점]
