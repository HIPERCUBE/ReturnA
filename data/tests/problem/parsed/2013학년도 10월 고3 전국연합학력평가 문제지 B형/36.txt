Arab leads to assumptions of the financially rich Arab. There 
are rich Arabs just as there are rich Americans and other 
rich people all over the world. [3점]

An automobile is a commodity that can be relocated 
nywhere. Its value is determined by the supply and 
emand for a particular model, based on upgrades and 
ondition. (A)  , if two 2004 Speero cars were 
vailable for sale and had identical upgrades and mileage, 
e vehicle in poorer condition would be priced lower. A 
ome’s value is also determined by the supply and demand 
r the home, based on the model of the home, upgrades, 
nd the current state of the home ― in other words, 
hether it is in good shape. But there is one large 
ifference between a car and a home. A home cannot 
avel. It is firmly rooted where it is built. (B)  , a 
ome’s value, unlike the automobile’s, is as dependent on

ome.

If you are intrigued by the emotional effect of movies 
through sensory input, try an experiment that researchers 
have performed in a more precise fashion.
A) Afterwards watch it one more time with the sound 
turned on. Compare how this film sequence impacts you 
differently with and without music. Most likely you will 
find the difference in emotional impact amazing.
B) If one of these scenes has minimal or no dialog but 
intense music, stop and rewind the tape to the 
beginning of the sequence, take a ten­minute break, and 
watch it again, this time with no sound.
C) Rent a movie that has affected you emotionally in the 
past. It might have made you feel joyful, open­hearted, 
inspired, scared, or sad. As you watch the movie, notice 
which scenes affect you strongly.

Instead, look for watermelons that are symmetrical, are 
heavy for their size, and have a creamy yellow spot on 
the bottom.
When faced with a bunch of watermelons, all promising 
delicious juiciness inside, how do you know which one to 
pick? ( ① ) It is suggested that you skip the tapping and 
instead check the bottom of the watermelon. ( ② ) Tapping 
a watermelon like a bongo might work for some people, but 
it’s too subjective. ( ③ ) And there’s no agreement on 
whether a watermelon is supposed to sound “solid” or “tight” 
or even make a b­flat sound. ( ④ ) This is where the 
watermelon sat on the ground while it soaked up the sun at 
the farm. ( ⑤ ) If this spot is white or greenish, your 
watermelon may have been picked too soon and might not be 
as ripe as it should be.

Online we can hang out in chat rooms with like­minded 
souls and join social networks that reflect our beliefs 
and interests, and even read news blogs that reflect our 
individual ideologies and views of the world. Groups are 
now formed less on shared activities and more on shared 
ideologies. We first identify our own values and 
preferences and then seek out communities that reflect 
those perspectives and inclinations. This shift that 
started online has spilled over into retail and business. It 
has changed the game in how successful products and 
services are marketed. Our collective mind­set has 
changed, and mass marketing no longer works. Now the

Camping for pleasure is not a direct descendant of 
nomadic culture. It emerged in the nineteenth century in 
response to a variety of social forces. First, the Romantic 
movement encouraged communing with the beauties of 
nature, while also glorifying the life of the lone outsider 
who rebelled against organized society. According to the 
historians of camping, Colin Ward and Dennis Hardy, 
works like Friedrich Schiller’s The Robbers and George 
Borrow’s nineteenth­century gypsy tales           the 
gypsy camp whose carefree occupants lived a simple, 
heroic life under the stars, contemptuous of settled town 
dwellers in their dull comfort. A second influence was 
the age of empire. European powers in Africa and Asia 
were busy trekking into the dark wilderness, pitching 
their bell tents and erecting barrack huts as they 
attempted to extend their control over indigenous lands. 
Camping was necessary for colonial expansion, and 
became a way of life not only for the troops, but for the 
explorers and missionaries. A final factor was the rise of 
emigration. Hundreds of thousands fled Europe in the 
nineteenth century to create new lives in Australia, the 
United States, Canada and South Africa, working as 
trappers, lumberjacks and ranchers, or lured by the gold 
rushes. A specialist industry grew up to supply their 
needs ― tents, camp beds, stoves, kettles, camp matches 
and coffee. Their tales of rough adventure were soon 
popularized in the press back home. Camping was 
becoming part of the cultural imagination.

Tina Larson was seventeen years old and always wore ①
a bright smile. This may not seem unusual ― but she was ③
born with cerebral palsy, a condition that left her ⑤
muscles stiff and unmanageable. Because (a) she had 
trouble speaking, this bright smile was the true reflection 
of her personality. She used a walker most of the time 
at school. A lot of people didn’t speak to her. Maybe it’s 
because she looked different, and the other students 
didn’t know how to approach her. Tina usually broke the 
ice with people she met in the halls with a big “Hi!”

When she finished, a fellow student said, “Tina, why 
did you do that? (b) She was just kidding and it’s only 
worth ten points.” Tina took her time forming the words, 
“Because I want to be like you guys ― normal.” Silence 
fell on the whole room, until another student exclaimed, 
“Tina, we’re not normal ― we’re teenagers! We get in 
trouble all the time!” “I know,” Tina said, and a big 
smile spread across her face. Tina got her ten points 
that day. She also got the love and respect of her 45.

One day, I gave my students an assignment that they ⑤
should memorize three stanzas of a poem. I made the 
assignment worth only ten points, because I figured most 
of my students wouldn’t do it. Tina was in the class, 
and I saw (d) her normal bright smile change to a look 
of worry. The day when the assignment was due came 
and my expectations were met as one by one each 
student failed to recite the poem. “Sorry, Mrs. Krause,” 
was the standard reply. Finally, in frustration and half 
kidding, I proclaimed that the next person who didn’t 
recite the poem perfectly had to drop to the floor and 
give me ten push­ups.

To my surprise, the next student was Tina. Using her 
walker, Tina moved to the front of the class and, 
straining to form the words, began to recite the poem. 
(e) She made it to the end of the first stanza ― and 
made a mistake. Before I could say a word, she threw 
her walker to the side, dropped to the floor, and started 
doing push­ups. I was horrified. But she stood in front of 
the class, and began again. This time she finished all 
three stanzas perfectly.
