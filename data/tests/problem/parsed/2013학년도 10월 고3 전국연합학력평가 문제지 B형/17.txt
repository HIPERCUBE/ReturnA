Common wisdom states, “If it tastes good, it’s not good 
for you.” It also says, “If you get to eat the foods you like, o
you’re not dieting.” There is no evidence to support these fu
claims. In fact, many diets fail due to this attitude. When p
dieting, there is no reason that the foods have to taste bad. a
I knew a bodybuilder who used to mix tuna, water, and o
protein powder in a blender for lunch. His idea was that p
food didn’t need to taste good; what really mattered was fa
getting nutrients. That mentality may work for some. But if w
you tell the majority of people that their food must be dull c
or that they can’t ever eat what they like, you are setting c
them up for failure. Flavor in the diet helps to ensure h
success as long as the flavor is not pushing you over your p
calorie budget. th

The psychological advice warns us most often about the 
limits of argumentation in dealing with another person and 
the truth at the same time. As Sir Thomas Browne once 26.
warned, in all disputes, the more passion there is, the less 
purpose there is. Debate, you often hear, typically generates 
more heat than light. Passion clouds reason. And in the a
context of an interpersonal argument, or debate, people o
sometimes are willing to do anything to save face. Joseph d
Addison once observed, “Our rivals in debates put me in the p
mind of the cuttlefish that, when he is unable to protect c

There is one realm where few have sought inspiration for

32. Some social critics would argue that the move toward an 
increasingly isolated individualism had been underway for 
some time ― at least since the middle of the twentieth

individual self­making with a new psychological component. 
Emotional well­being, the subjective experience of happiness, 
and the pursuit of pleasure, rather than, say, the 34.
accumulation of wealth, community involvement, and moral b
virtue, began to be equated with success. This focus on a
self­fulfillment constituted a departure from the traditional c
criteria for evaluating success. While the self­made man of b
the nineteenth and early­twentieth centuries aimed to b
achieve success in terms that were largely external and e
measurable (for example, accumulation of wealth, status, or fe
power), late­twentieth century self­making involves the o
pursuit of the rather more elusive and variable state of h
self­fulfillment. With the emergence of an emphasis on fo
self­fulfillment, one finds there is no end­point for a

e sole property of children, a prime example being Daniel 
efoe’s Robinson Crusoe, which is read by children around 
e world, but very rarely by adults in any country. First

Camping for pleasure is not a direct descendant of 
nomadic culture. It emerged in the nineteenth century in 
response to a variety of social forces. First, the Romantic 
movement encouraged communing with the beauties of 
nature, while also glorifying the life of the lone outsider 
who rebelled against organized society. According to the 
historians of camping, Colin Ward and Dennis Hardy, 
works like Friedrich Schiller’s The Robbers and George 
Borrow’s nineteenth­century gypsy tales           the 
gypsy camp whose carefree occupants lived a simple, 
heroic life under the stars, contemptuous of settled town 
dwellers in their dull comfort. A second influence was 
the age of empire. European powers in Africa and Asia 
were busy trekking into the dark wilderness, pitching 
their bell tents and erecting barrack huts as they 
attempted to extend their control over indigenous lands. 
Camping was necessary for colonial expansion, and 
became a way of life not only for the troops, but for the 
explorers and missionaries. A final factor was the rise of 
emigration. Hundreds of thousands fled Europe in the 
nineteenth century to create new lives in Australia, the 
United States, Canada and South Africa, working as 
trappers, lumberjacks and ranchers, or lured by the gold 
rushes. A specialist industry grew up to supply their 
needs ― tents, camp beds, stoves, kettles, camp matches 
and coffee. Their tales of rough adventure were soon 
popularized in the press back home. Camping was 
becoming part of the cultural imagination.
