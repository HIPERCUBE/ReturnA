33. Until J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series set in motion an 
extraordinary child­to­adult crossover craze that took the 
entire world by storm, books generally crossed over in the 
opposite direction. Children                               . 
In fact, this type of readership transgression has been going 
on almost as long as books have existed. Many of the 
world’s great classics were appropriated very early on by 
children, even though they were not written with young 
readers in mind. Some works very quickly assumed the 
status of crossover works. A number of them became almost 
the sole property of children, a prime example being Daniel 
Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, which is read by children around 
the world, but very rarely by adults in any country. First 
published in 1719, Defoe’s most celebrated work was not 
meant for children, but became a classic of children’s 
literature and inspired countless adaptations and edited 
versions. [3점]
