절한 것은?
When two monkeys are trapped together in a small cage, 
they try everything they can to (A) prevent / start  a fight. 
Moving with caution and suppressing any behaviors that could 
trigger aggression are good short­term solutions to the 
problem. The monkeys sit in a corner and avoid any random 
movements; even a brief touch could be interpreted as the 
beginning of (B) generous / hostile  action. Mutual eye contact 
is also dangerous because, in monkey language, staring is a 
threat. The monkeys look up in the air or at the ground, or 
stare at some imaginary point outside the cage. But as time 
passes, sitting still and pretending (C) authority / indifference  
are no longer sufficient strategies to keep the situation under 
control. To avoid aggression and to reduce stress, an act of 
communication is needed to make it clear to the other 
monkey that no harm is intended.
(A) (B) (C)
① prevent generous authority
② prevent hostile authority
③ prevent hostile indifference
④ start hostile indifference
⑤ start generous authority
