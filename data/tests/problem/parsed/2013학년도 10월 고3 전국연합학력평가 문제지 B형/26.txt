Inside the compound, just beyond the gates, in the 
admissions tent, Dr. Milton Tectonidis examines a two­year 
old boy clinging to his mother’s breast. “He’s quite 
dehydrated,” ① he says, “so I’ll keep him here.” He gently 
pinches the skin of the child’s left arm to check if the skin 
comes back. The boy’s name is Rashidu. ② His eyes are 
wide, and he looks right at Dr. Tectonidis. In his native 
Canada, Dr. Tectonidis might be mistaken for a drifter. His 
long hair is uncombed; ③ his thin body swims in the white 
T­shirt he always wears. He has worked with Doctors 
Without Borders for more than a dozen years, and in as 
many countries. ④ He has treated tens of thousands of 
children, perhaps hundreds of thousands. He’s lost count of 
how many ⑤ he has saved.
