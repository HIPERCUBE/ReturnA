Online we can hang out in chat rooms with like­minded 
souls and join social networks that reflect our beliefs 
and interests, and even read news blogs that reflect our 
individual ideologies and views of the world. Groups are 
now formed less on shared activities and more on shared 
ideologies. We first identify our own values and 
preferences and then seek out communities that reflect 
those perspectives and inclinations. This shift that 
started online has spilled over into retail and business. It 
has changed the game in how successful products and 
services are marketed. Our collective mind­set has 
changed, and mass marketing no longer works. Now the 
way to get mass support is by microtargeting groups 
with strong kinship relevancy. Smaller “tribes,” where 41.

Camping for pleasure is not a direct descendant of 
nomadic culture. It emerged in the nineteenth century in 
response to a variety of social forces. First, the Romantic 
movement encouraged communing with the beauties of 
nature, while also glorifying the life of the lone outsider 
who rebelled against organized society. According to the 
historians of camping, Colin Ward and Dennis Hardy, 
works like Friedrich Schiller’s The Robbers and George 
Borrow’s nineteenth­century gypsy tales           the 
gypsy camp whose carefree occupants lived a simple, 
heroic life under the stars, contemptuous of settled town 
dwellers in their dull comfort. A second influence was 
the age of empire. European powers in Africa and Asia 
were busy trekking into the dark wilderness, pitching 
their bell tents and erecting barrack huts as they 
attempted to extend their control over indigenous lands. 
Camping was necessary for colonial expansion, and 
became a way of life not only for the troops, but for the 
explorers and missionaries. A final factor was the rise of 
emigration. Hundreds of thousands fled Europe in the 
nineteenth century to create new lives in Australia, the 
United States, Canada and South Africa, working as 
trappers, lumberjacks and ranchers, or lured by the gold 
rushes. A specialist industry grew up to supply their 
needs ― tents, camp beds, stoves, kettles, camp matches 
and coffee. Their tales of rough adventure were soon 
popularized in the press back home. Camping was 
becoming part of the cultural imagination.

Tina Larson was seventeen years old and always wore ①
a bright smile. This may not seem unusual ― but she was ③
born with cerebral palsy, a condition that left her ⑤
muscles stiff and unmanageable. Because (a) she had 
trouble speaking, this bright smile was the true reflection 
of her personality. She used a walker most of the time 
at school. A lot of people didn’t speak to her. Maybe it’s 
because she looked different, and the other students 
didn’t know how to approach her. Tina usually broke the 
ice with people she met in the halls with a big “Hi!”

(B) ①
When she finished, a fellow student said, “Tina, why 
did you do that? (b) She was just kidding and it’s only 
worth ten points.” Tina took her time forming the words, 
“Because I want to be like you guys ― normal.” Silence 
fell on the whole room, until another student exclaimed, 
“Tina, we’re not normal ― we’re teenagers! We get in 
trouble all the time!” “I know,” Tina said, and a big 
smile spread across her face. Tina got her ten points 
that day. She also got the love and respect of her 45.
classmates, and to (c) her that was worth a lot more. ①②
(C) ③④
One day, I gave my students an assignment that they ⑤
should memorize three stanzas of a poem. I made the 
assignment worth only ten points, because I figured most 
of my students wouldn’t do it. Tina was in the class, 
and I saw (d) her normal bright smile change to a look 
of worry. The day when the assignment was due came 
and my expectations were met as one by one each 
student failed to recite the poem. “Sorry, Mrs. Krause,” 
was the standard reply. Finally, in frustration and half 
kidding, I proclaimed that the next person who didn’t 
recite the poem perfectly had to drop to the floor and 
give me ten push­ups.
* stanza: (시의) 연(聯)
(D)
To my surprise, the next student was Tina. Using her 
walker, Tina moved to the front of the class and, 
straining to form the words, began to recite the poem. 
(e) She made it to the end of the first stanza ― and 
made a mistake. Before I could say a word, she threw 
her walker to the side, dropped to the floor, and started 
doing push­ups. I was horrified. But she stood in front of 
the class, and began again. This time she finished all 
three stanzas perfectly.
