There is one realm where few have sought inspiration for 
our dilemma about how to live: history. I believe that the 
future of the art of living can be found by gazing into the 
past. If we explore how people have lived in other epochs 
and cultures, we can draw out lessons for the challenges and 
opportunities of everyday life. What secrets for living with 
passion lie in medieval attitudes towards death, or in the pin 
factories of the industrial revolution? How might an encounter 
with Ming­dynasty China, or Central African indigenous 
culture, change our views about bringing up our kids and 
caring for our parents? It is astonishing that, until now, we 
have made so little effort to unveil this wisdom from the 
past, which is based on how people have actually lived rather 
than utopian dreamings of what might be possible.
