것은?
Joseph H. Pilates was born in Germany in 1880 and was a 
weak child with asthma who was determined to be strong. He 
was imprisoned in England during World War I because of his 
German citizenship. While in England, he became a nurse and 
began designing exercise apparatus for immobilized hospital 
patients. The devices and exercises became the foundation for 
his method of body conditioning and strengthening. In 1926, he 
moved to New York City and opened his first Pilates Studio. 
The body building and fitness techniques he developed became 
widely used all over the world by dancers, actors, sports 
teams, spas, and fitness enthusiasts. Dancers such as Martha 
Graham and George Balanchine were among the first to adopt 
his fitness techniques. Today, his exercises are recommended 
by physical therapists as part of an overall program of 
rehabilitation for patients who have suffered stress injuries.
