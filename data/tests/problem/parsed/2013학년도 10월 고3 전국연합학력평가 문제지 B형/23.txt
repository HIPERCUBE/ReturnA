Common wisdom states, “If it tastes good, it’s not good 
for you.” It also says, “If you get to eat the foods you like, 
you’re not dieting.” There is no evidence to support these 
claims. In fact, many diets fail due to this attitude. When 
dieting, there is no reason that the foods have to taste bad. 
I knew a bodybuilder who used to mix tuna, water, and 
protein powder in a blender for lunch. His idea was that 
food didn’t need to taste good; what really mattered was 
getting nutrients. That mentality may work for some. But if 
you tell the majority of people that their food must be dull 
or that they can’t ever eat what they like, you are setting 
them up for failure. Flavor in the diet helps to ensure 
success as long as the flavor is not pushing you over your 
calorie budget.
