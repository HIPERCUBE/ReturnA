23. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Common wisdom states, “If it tastes good, it’s not good 
for you.” It also says, “If you get to eat the foods you like, 
you’re not dieting.” There is no evidence to support these 
claims. In fact, many diets fail due to this attitude. When 
dieting, there is no reason that the foods have to taste bad. 
I knew a bodybuilder who used to mix tuna, water, and 
protein powder in a blender for lunch. His idea was that 
food didn’t need to taste good; what really mattered was 
getting nutrients. That mentality may work for some. But if 
you tell the majority of people that their food must be dull 
or that they can’t ever eat what they like, you are setting 
them up for failure. Flavor in the diet helps to ensure 
success as long as the flavor is not pushing you over your 
calorie budget.

24. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
The psychological advice warns us most often about the 
limits of argumentation in dealing with another person and 
the truth at the same time. As Sir Thomas Browne once 
warned, in all disputes, the more passion there is, the less 
purpose there is. Debate, you often hear, typically generates 
more heat than light. Passion clouds reason. And in the 
context of an interpersonal argument, or debate, people 
sometimes are willing to do anything to save face. Joseph 
Addison once observed, “Our rivals in debates put me in the 
mind of the cuttlefish that, when he is unable to protect 
himself, blackens the water about him till he becomes 
invisible.” So, as Publilius Syrus concluded long ago, in a 
heated argument, we are apt to lose sight of the truth.
① the difficulty of seeing the truth during a heated debate
② the importance of truly listening to others in a debate
③ the rules to keep in mind for a successful research
④ the ways to win a debate without hurting others
⑤ the process of drawing a reasonable conclusion
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
There is one realm where few have sought inspiration for 
our dilemma about how to live: history. I believe that the 
future of the art of living can be found by gazing into the 
past. If we explore how people have lived in other epochs 
and cultures, we can draw out lessons for the challenges and 
opportunities of everyday life. What secrets for living with 
passion lie in medieval attitudes towards death, or in the pin 
factories of the industrial revolution? How might an encounter 
with Ming­dynasty China, or Central African indigenous 
culture, change our views about bringing up our kids and 
caring for our parents? It is astonishing that, until now, we 
have made so little effort to unveil this wisdom from the 
past, which is based on how people have actually lived rather 
than utopian dreamings of what might be possible.

② History: A Fountain of Insights

Inside the compound, just beyond the gates, in the 
admissions tent, Dr. Milton Tectonidis examines a two­year 
old boy clinging to his mother’s breast. “He’s quite 
dehydrated,” ① he says, “so I’ll keep him here.” He gently 
pinches the skin of the child’s left arm to check if the skin 
comes back. The boy’s name is Rashidu. ② His eyes are 
wide, and he looks right at Dr. Tectonidis. In his native 
Canada, Dr. Tectonidis might be mistaken for a drifter. His 
long hair is uncombed; ③ his thin body swims in the white 
T­shirt he always wears. He has worked with Doctors 
Without Borders for more than a dozen years, and in as 
many countries. ④ He has treated tens of thousands of 
children, perhaps hundreds of thousands. He’s lost count of 
how many ⑤ he has saved.

With all the passion for being slim, it is no wonder ① that 
many people view any amount of visible fat on the body as 
something to get rid of. However, the human body has 
evolved over time in environments of food scarcity; hence, 
the ability to store fat ② efficiently is a valuable physiological 
function that served our ancestors well for thousands of 
years. Only in the last few decades, in the primarily 
industrially developed economies, ③ have food become so 
plentiful and easy to obtain as to cause fat­related health 
problems. People no longer have to spend most of their time 
and energy ④ gathering berries and seeds and hoping that a 
hunting party will return with meat. All we have to do 
nowadays is drive to the supermarket or the fast­food 
restaurant, ⑤ where for very low cost we can obtain nearly 
all of our daily calories.

절한 것은?
When two monkeys are trapped together in a small cage, 
they try everything they can to (A) prevent / start  a fight. 
Moving with caution and suppressing any behaviors that could 
trigger aggression are good short­term solutions to the 
problem. The monkeys sit in a corner and avoid any random 
movements; even a brief touch could be interpreted as the 
beginning of (B) generous / hostile  action. Mutual eye contact 
is also dangerous because, in monkey language, staring is a 
threat. The monkeys look up in the air or at the ground, or 
stare at some imaginary point outside the cage. But as time 
passes, sitting still and pretending (C) authority / indifference  
are no longer sufficient strategies to keep the situation under 
control. To avoid aggression and to reduce stress, an act of 
communication is needed to make it clear to the other 
monkey that no harm is intended.
(A) (B) (C)
① prevent generous authority
② prevent hostile authority
③ prevent hostile indifference
④ start hostile indifference
⑤ start generous authority

The graph above shows the percentage of people holding a 
driving license within age groups by gender in Scotland in 
2011. ① In total, a higher proportion of males (76%) held a 
license compared to females (60%), and in each age group the 
percentage of males was higher than that of females. ② The 
percentage of license holders for males in the 35 to 44 age 
group was exactly the same as that for males in the 45 to 59 
age group. ③ The percentage of females holding a license 
peaked in the 35 to 44 age group. ④ The percentage gap 
between male and female license holders was the biggest in 
those aged 75 and over. ⑤ On the other hand, the percentage 
gap between male and female license holders was the smallest 
in the 25 to 34 age group.
30. Joseph H. Pilates에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
Joseph H. Pilates was born in Germany in 1880 and was a 
weak child with asthma who was determined to be strong. He 
was imprisoned in England during World War I because of his 
German citizenship. While in England, he became a nurse and 
began designing exercise apparatus for immobilized hospital 
patients. The devices and exercises became the foundation for 
his method of body conditioning and strengthening. In 1926, he 
moved to New York City and opened his first Pilates Studio. 
The body building and fitness techniques he developed became 
widely used all over the world by dancers, actors, sports 
teams, spas, and fitness enthusiasts. Dancers such as Martha 
Graham and George Balanchine were among the first to adopt 
his fitness techniques. Today, his exercises are recommended 
by physical therapists as part of an overall program of 
rehabilitation for patients who have suffered stress injuries.

31. The person who relates to certain individuals as family 
members or friends to the exclusion of others does not affirm 
that those to whom he relates are better persons. He affirms 
only that they are his relatives or friends. When a new father 
tells his two­week­old daughter that she is the “cutest little 
girl in town,” he is not informing the infant that she would 
win a beauty contest of girls of her age before a fair panel of 
judges. He is, more than anything else, telling her that she is 
his little girl. The same is true in general when people assert 
that their spouses, their parents, and their sons and daughters 
are “the best.” The highest praises are used to indicate that 
certain persons                                      .
① will have to be independent early
② are to be under extreme pressure
③ are the target of others’ criticism
④ are the specific objects of affection
⑤ have a network of many influential people
32. Some social critics would argue that the move toward an 
increasingly isolated individualism had been underway for 
some time ― at least since the middle of the twentieth 
century, when psychoanalysis had infused the ideal of 
individual self­making with a new psychological component. 
Emotional well­being, the subjective experience of happiness, 
and the pursuit of pleasure, rather than, say, the 
accumulation of wealth, community involvement, and moral 
virtue, began to be equated with success. This focus on 
self­fulfillment constituted a departure from the traditional 
criteria for evaluating success. While the self­made man of 
the nineteenth and early­twentieth centuries aimed to 
achieve success in terms that were largely external and 
measurable (for example, accumulation of wealth, status, or 
power), late­twentieth century self­making involves the 
pursuit of the rather more elusive and variable state of 
self­fulfillment. With the emergence of an emphasis on 
self­fulfillment, one finds there is no end­point for 
self­making: individuals can                         . [3점]
* infuse: 주입하다, 불어넣다
① see the world in a more conservative perspective
② contribute to the preservation of traditional cultures
③ help their team reach the common goals in a proper way
④ compete against other strong opponents for the top 
positions
⑤ continuously pursue shifting and subjective criteria for 
success
33. Until J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series set in motion an 
extraordinary child­to­adult crossover craze that took the 
entire world by storm, books generally crossed over in the 
opposite direction. Children                               . 
In fact, this type of readership transgression has been going 
on almost as long as books have existed. Many of the 
world’s great classics were appropriated very early on by 
children, even though they were not written with young 
readers in mind. Some works very quickly assumed the 
status of crossover works. A number of them became almost 
the sole property of children, a prime example being Daniel 
Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, which is read by children around 
the world, but very rarely by adults in any country. First 
published in 1719, Defoe’s most celebrated work was not 
meant for children, but became a classic of children’s 
literature and inspired countless adaptations and edited 
versions. [3점]
* transgression: 침범
① have lost interest in literature
② have ventured into writing stories
③ have long laid claim to adult fiction
④ have been characterized in many novels
⑤ have been protected from the cruel world
34. Horseshoe crabs have copper in their blood that makes the 
blood turn royal blue in the air. The odd­colored blood has 
an amazing trait. It detects bacteria (germs) and forms a 
clot. In the 1960s, scientists invented a test using horseshoe 
blood to detect endotoxins, the chemical poisons some 
bacteria make, in human medicines. Just a tiny amount of 
endotoxins in a person’s bloodstream can cause dangerous 
fevers and even death. To test if a drug is clean of bacteria 
or endotoxins, the drug is mixed with an extract from 
horseshoe blood, called Limulus lysate. If a jellylike clot 
forms, the drug is not safe. The Limulus lysate test is quick 
and can detect even the tiniest amount of endotoxins. It is 
used worldwide to check if medicines, blood donations, and 
medical supplies are clean and safe. Every year, the 
extraordinary blue bloods                         .
* clot: (피의) 엉긴 덩어리
① are polluted with heavy metals
② produce harmful bacteria
③ are in low demand
④ save thousands of human lives
⑤ are used to remove blood clots
35. No animal surpasses humans in                          , 
and we’ve been doing it for a long time. The “Iceman,” 
whose 5,200­year­old corpse was discovered on a glacier on 
the Italian­Austrian border, had stuffed grasses into his 
shoes to keep his feet warm and was carrying a sloe berry. 
Human transport of plants increased abundantly as our 
transportation technology developed. People transported and 
introduced some non­native species intentionally, for food, 
fiber, medicine, ornament or scientific curiosity. Seeds of 
other plants were introduced accidentally in sacks of seed 
grain, wool or cotton, or in mud stuck to machinery. Human 
activities like farming, irrigation, forestry and mining have 
made it easier for these non­native species to become 
established by removing native vegetation, disturbing the soil 
and altering the availability of water and nutrients.
① fighting colds ② dispersing plants
③ sharing resources ④ protecting habitats
⑤ running a long distance

36. “Sand,” “rich,” “oil,” and “Bedouin” are all stereotypes about 
Arabs. Some people imagine the Arab World as a giant 
desert, with cities and villages scattered randomly throughout. 
Though a conventional image of many people, this is, of 
course, a very (A)  picture of the region. There are 
vast deserts in the Arab World, and in parts of those deserts 
Bedouins and nomads live. However, supposing that this 
predominates would be like saying that the United States is 
made up of country towns run by cowboys. The topography 
and climate of the Arab World are as (B) as its 
people. There are beaches, dense forests, mountains that are 
snowcapped year­round, large metropolises, and every 
imaginable climate. Moreover, not every Arab country 
possesses oil. There are potentially more oil reserves in 
Alaska than in Saudi Arabia. The stereotype of the oil­rich 
Arab leads to assumptions of the financially rich Arab. There 
are rich Arabs just as there are rich Americans and other 
rich people all over the world. [3점]

37. An automobile is a commodity that can be relocated 
anywhere. Its value is determined by the supply and 
demand for a particular model, based on upgrades and 
condition. (A)  , if two 2004 Speero cars were 
available for sale and had identical upgrades and mileage, 
the vehicle in poorer condition would be priced lower. A 
home’s value is also determined by the supply and demand 
for the home, based on the model of the home, upgrades, 
and the current state of the home ― in other words, 
whether it is in good shape. But there is one large 
difference between a car and a home. A home cannot 
travel. It is firmly rooted where it is built. (B)  , a 
home’s value, unlike the automobile’s, is as dependent on 
its location as on its characteristics and amenities. Even if 
a home is in excellent condition, if the neighborhood in 
which it resides deteriorates, so will the value of the 
home.

② By contrast Likewise

through sensory input, try an experiment that researchers

Instead, look for watermelons that are symmetrical, are 
heavy for their size, and have a creamy yellow spot on 
the bottom.
When faced with a bunch of watermelons, all promising 
delicious juiciness inside, how do you know which one to 
pick? ( ① ) It is suggested that you skip the tapping and 
instead check the bottom of the watermelon. ( ② ) Tapping 
a watermelon like a bongo might work for some people, but 
it’s too subjective. ( ③ ) And there’s no agreement on 
whether a watermelon is supposed to sound “solid” or “tight” 
or even make a b­flat sound. ( ④ ) This is where the 
watermelon sat on the ground while it soaked up the sun at 
the farm. ( ⑤ ) If this spot is white or greenish, your 
watermelon may have been picked too soon and might not be 
as ripe as it should be.

Online we can hang out in chat rooms with like­minded 
souls and join social networks that reflect our beliefs 
and interests, and even read news blogs that reflect our 
individual ideologies and views of the world. Groups are 
now formed less on shared activities and more on shared 
ideologies. We first identify our own values and 
preferences and then seek out communities that reflect 
those perspectives and inclinations. This shift that 
started online has spilled over into retail and business. It 
has changed the game in how successful products and 
services are marketed. Our collective mind­set has 
changed, and mass marketing no longer works. Now the 
way to get mass support is by microtargeting groups 
with strong kinship relevancy. Smaller “tribes,” where 
members have the same or almost identical mind­set and 
a strong sense of kinship, have the power to create 
global success for a product.

Camping for pleasure is not a direct descendant of 
nomadic culture. It emerged in the nineteenth century in 
response to a variety of social forces. First, the Romantic 
movement encouraged communing with the beauties of 
nature, while also glorifying the life of the lone outsider 
who rebelled against organized society. According to the 
historians of camping, Colin Ward and Dennis Hardy, 
works like Friedrich Schiller’s The Robbers and George 
Borrow’s nineteenth­century gypsy tales           the 
gypsy camp whose carefree occupants lived a simple, 
heroic life under the stars, contemptuous of settled town 
dwellers in their dull comfort. A second influence was 
the age of empire. European powers in Africa and Asia 
were busy trekking into the dark wilderness, pitching 
their bell tents and erecting barrack huts as they 
attempted to extend their control over indigenous lands. 
Camping was necessary for colonial expansion, and 
became a way of life not only for the troops, but for the 
explorers and missionaries. A final factor was the rise of 
emigration. Hundreds of thousands fled Europe in the 
nineteenth century to create new lives in Australia, the 
United States, Canada and South Africa, working as 
trappers, lumberjacks and ranchers, or lured by the gold 
rushes. A specialist industry grew up to supply their 
needs ― tents, camp beds, stoves, kettles, camp matches 
and coffee. Their tales of rough adventure were soon

(A)
Tina Larson was seventeen years old and always wore 
a bright smile. This may not seem unusual ― but she was 
born with cerebral palsy, a condition that left her 
muscles stiff and unmanageable. Because (a) she had 
trouble speaking, this bright smile was the true reflection 
of her personality. She used a walker most of the time 
at school. A lot of people didn’t speak to her. Maybe it’s 
because she looked different, and the other students 
didn’t know how to approach her. Tina usually broke the 
ice with people she met in the halls with a big “Hi!”
* cerebral palsy: 뇌성마비
(B)
When she finished, a fellow student said, “Tina, why 
did you do that? (b) She was just kidding and it’s only 
worth ten points.” Tina took her time forming the words, 
“Because I want to be like you guys ― normal.” Silence 
fell on the whole room, until another student exclaimed, 
“Tina, we’re not normal ― we’re teenagers! We get in 
trouble all the time!” “I know,” Tina said, and a big 
smile spread across her face. Tina got her ten points 
that day. She also got the love and respect of her 
classmates, and to (c) her that was worth a lot more.
(C)
One day, I gave my students an assignment that they 
should memorize three stanzas of a poem. I made the 
assignment worth only ten points, because I figured most 
of my students wouldn’t do it. Tina was in the class, 
and I saw (d) her normal bright smile change to a look 
of worry. The day when the assignment was due came 
and my expectations were met as one by one each 
student failed to recite the poem. “Sorry, Mrs. Krause,” 
was the standard reply. Finally, in frustration and half 
kidding, I proclaimed that the next person who didn’t 
recite the poem perfectly had to drop to the floor and 
give me ten push­ups.
* stanza: (시의) 연(聯)
(D)
To my surprise, the next student was Tina. Using her 
walker, Tina moved to the front of the class and, 
straining to form the words, began to recite the poem. 
(e) She made it to the end of the first stanza ― and 
made a mistake. Before I could say a word, she threw 
her walker to the side, dropped to the floor, and started 
doing push­ups. I was horrified. But she stood in front of 
the class, and began again. This time she finished all 
three stanzas perfectly.
