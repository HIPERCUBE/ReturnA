Common wisdom states, “If it tastes good, it’s not good 
for you.” It also says, “If you get to eat the foods you like, o
you’re not dieting.” There is no evidence to support these fu
claims. In fact, many diets fail due to this attitude. When p
dieting, there is no reason that the foods have to taste bad. a
I knew a bodybuilder who used to mix tuna, water, and o
protein powder in a blender for lunch. His idea was that p
food didn’t need to taste good; what really mattered was fa
getting nutrients. That mentality may work for some. But if w
you tell the majority of people that their food must be dull c
or that they can’t ever eat what they like, you are setting c
them up for failure. Flavor in the diet helps to ensure h
success as long as the flavor is not pushing you over your p
calorie budget. th

The psychological advice warns us most often about the 
limits of argumentation in dealing with another person and 
the truth at the same time. As Sir Thomas Browne once 26.
warned, in all disputes, the more passion there is, the less 
purpose there is. Debate, you often hear, typically generates 
more heat than light. Passion clouds reason. And in the a
context of an interpersonal argument, or debate, people o
sometimes are willing to do anything to save face. Joseph d
Addison once observed, “Our rivals in debates put me in the p
mind of the cuttlefish that, when he is unable to protect c
himself, blackens the water about him till he becomes w
invisible.” So, as Publilius Syrus concluded long ago, in a C
heated argument, we are apt to lose sight of the truth. loT

There is one realm where few have sought inspiration for 
ur dilemma about how to live: history. I believe that the 
ture of the art of living can be found by gazing into the 
ast. If we explore how people have lived in other epochs 
nd cultures, we can draw out lessons for the challenges and 
pportunities of everyday life. What secrets for living with 
assion lie in medieval attitudes towards death, or in the pin 
ctories of the industrial revolution? How might an encounter 
ith Ming­dynasty China, or Central African indigenous 
ulture, change our views about bringing up our kids and 
aring for our parents? It is astonishing that, until now, we 
ave made so little effort to unveil this wisdom from the 
ast, which is based on how people have actually lived rather 
an utopian dreamings of what might be possible.

With all the passion for being slim, it is no wonder ① that 
many people view any amount of visible fat on the body as 
something to get rid of. However, the human body has 
evolved over time in environments of food scarcity; hence, 
the ability to store fat ② efficiently is a valuable physiological 
function that served our ancestors well for thousands of 
years. Only in the last few decades, in the primarily 
industrially developed economies, ③ have food become so 
plentiful and easy to obtain as to cause fat­related health 
problems. People no longer have to spend most of their time 
and energy ④ gathering berries and seeds and hoping that a 
hunting party will return with meat. All we have to do 
nowadays is drive to the supermarket or the fast­food 
restaurant, ⑤ where for very low cost we can obtain nearly 
all of our daily calories.

36. “Sand,” “rich,” “oil,” and “Bedouin” are all stereotypes about

When faced with a bunch of watermelons, all promising

pick? ( ① ) It is suggested that you skip the tapping and 
instead check the bottom of the watermelon. ( ② ) Tapping 
a watermelon like a bongo might work for some people, but 
it’s too subjective. ( ③ ) And there’s no agreement on 
whether a watermelon is supposed to sound “solid” or “tight”

Online we can hang out in chat rooms with like­minded 
souls and join social networks that reflect our beliefs 
and interests, and even read news blogs that reflect our 
individual ideologies and views of the world. Groups are 
now formed less on shared activities and more on shared 
ideologies. We first identify our own values and 
preferences and then seek out communities that reflect 
those perspectives and inclinations. This shift that 
started online has spilled over into retail and business. It 
has changed the game in how successful products and 
services are marketed. Our collective mind­set has 
changed, and mass marketing no longer works. Now the

Camping for pleasure is not a direct descendant of 
nomadic culture. It emerged in the nineteenth century in 
response to a variety of social forces. First, the Romantic 
movement encouraged communing with the beauties of 
nature, while also glorifying the life of the lone outsider 
who rebelled against organized society. According to the 
historians of camping, Colin Ward and Dennis Hardy, 
works like Friedrich Schiller’s The Robbers and George 
Borrow’s nineteenth­century gypsy tales           the 
gypsy camp whose carefree occupants lived a simple, 
heroic life under the stars, contemptuous of settled town 
dwellers in their dull comfort. A second influence was 
the age of empire. European powers in Africa and Asia 
were busy trekking into the dark wilderness, pitching 
their bell tents and erecting barrack huts as they 
attempted to extend their control over indigenous lands. 
Camping was necessary for colonial expansion, and 
became a way of life not only for the troops, but for the 
explorers and missionaries. A final factor was the rise of 
emigration. Hundreds of thousands fled Europe in the 
nineteenth century to create new lives in Australia, the 
United States, Canada and South Africa, working as 
trappers, lumberjacks and ranchers, or lured by the gold 
rushes. A specialist industry grew up to supply their 
needs ― tents, camp beds, stoves, kettles, camp matches 
and coffee. Their tales of rough adventure were soon 
popularized in the press back home. Camping was 
becoming part of the cultural imagination.

Tina Larson was seventeen years old and always wore ①

born with cerebral palsy, a condition that left her ⑤
muscles stiff and unmanageable. Because (a) she had 
trouble speaking, this bright smile was the true reflection

at school. A lot of people didn’t speak to her. Maybe it’s 
because she looked different, and the other students

was the standard reply. Finally, in frustration and half

To my surprise, the next student was Tina. Using her

made a mistake. Before I could say a word, she threw 
her walker to the side, dropped to the floor, and started 
doing push­ups. I was horrified. But she stood in front of 
the class, and began again. This time she finished all 
three stanzas perfectly.
