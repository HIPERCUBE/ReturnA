Sometimes children may want to do more than they 
are capable of doing. For example, the five­year­old son 
of a friend of ours went on a hike with his father. At 
one point the boy asked his father to let him carry a 
heavy backpack the way the “big people” do. Without 
saying a word, the father took his backpack off and 
handed it to his son, who immediately discovered that it 
was too heavy for him to carry. The boy simply 
exclaimed, “Dad, it’s too heavy for me.” He then went 
happily on his way up the trail. In a safe way the father 
had allowed his son to discover experientially that he 
was, indeed, too small. He had also avoided a potential 
argument with his son.
