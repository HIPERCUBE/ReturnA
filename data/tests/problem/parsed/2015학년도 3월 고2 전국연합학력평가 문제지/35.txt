Human beings have always had the capacity to think 
spatially ― this is here, that is there ― even though not 
everybody chooses to express this understanding in 
mapmaking. ① The capacity to form mental maps must have 
been essential for the early humans. ② Hunter­gatherers, for 
instance, recognized the routes of the migratory animals and 
the best places to hunt them down even without a physical 
map. ③ Wandering tribesmen needed to know how they 
could cross deserts safely without dying of thirst. ④ Before 
the invention of printing from wood blocks, maps were 
drawn on sheepskin or other suitable material and could be 
reproduced only by hand copying. ⑤ All these people would 
have carried a map of their land in their head.
