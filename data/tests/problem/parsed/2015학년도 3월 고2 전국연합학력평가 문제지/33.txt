33. Jacqueline Novogratz, the founder of the Acumen Fund, 
tells a story that                                       . 
Her story centers on a blue sweater. It was given to her by 
her uncle Ed when she was twelve. “I loved that soft wool 
sweater with its striped sleeves and two zebras in the 
front,” she says. She even wrote her name on the tag. But 
the sweater got too tight for her as she grew older. So in 
her freshman year of high school she donated it to a 
charity. Eleven years later, she was jogging in Kigali, 
Rwanda, where she was working to set up an aid program 
for poor women. Suddenly, she spotted a little boy wearing 
a similar sweater. Could it be? She ran over to him and 
checked out the tag. Yes, there was her name. It was 
enough to remind Jacqueline ― and the rest of us ― of the 
threads of our connection to one another.
