23. If you watch airline attendants when flight safety 
instructions are being given, you’ll notice that they hold the 
life jacket, oxygen mask, and other demonstration materials 
like pieces of art being auctioned at Christie’s. Why? 
Because it draws attention to those items and conveys their 
importance. According to a large restaurant owner, his 
servers are taught to present trays of food to customers 
with both hands and with respect. Doing so leaves others 
with a more favorable impression of the server and the 
restaurant. The same principle applies to anything you hold 
while speaking in public. Whether it is a piece of paper, a 
workbook, or a product, if you want to let your audience 
know what you are holding is important, handle the item 
with respect and care.
