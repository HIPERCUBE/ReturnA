When you purchase an item, you are paying not just 
for the item, but the costs to get that item to you. 
(A) When you buy that tomato at a supermarket, however, 
there are a number of costs that result in you paying 
much more than you would pay the farmer. 
(B) Let’s say you visit a farm and buy a tomato. It might 
cost the farmer very little to grow a tomato, so the 
farmer might be able to sell you a tomato for much less 
than it would cost in the supermarket and still make a 
nice profit. 
(C) That tomato has to be transported to the store; the 
store must pay rent, electric bills, and employee wages; 
and the store advertises tomatoes in its weekly 
newspaper ad.
