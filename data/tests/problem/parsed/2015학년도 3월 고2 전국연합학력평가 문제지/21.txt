21. No Stone Age ten­year­old would have been living on 
tender foods like modern potato chips, hamburgers, and 
pasta. Their meals would have required far more chewing 
than is ever demanded of a modern child. Insufficient use of 
jaw muscles in the early years of modern life may result in 
their underdevelopment and in weaker and smaller bone 
structure. The growth of human teeth requires a jaw 
structure of a certain size and shape, one that might not be 
produced if usage during development is inadequate. Crowded 
and misplaced incisors and imperfect wisdom teeth may be 
diseases of civilization. Perhaps many dental problems would 
be prevented if more biting were encouraged for children.
