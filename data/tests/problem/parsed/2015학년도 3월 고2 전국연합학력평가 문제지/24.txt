Pocket gophers include several species that range across 
the western half of the United States. They prefer habitats 
where the earth is soft and easy to dig in, and they spend 
most of their time underground. As many as seven young 
are born in the spring. As soon as they are weaned, they 
dig burrows of their own and begin life alone. Mature 
gophers are 6 - 13 inches long and weigh up to a pound. 
Their bodies are fur covered except for a short thick tail. 
Gophers eat roots and other parts of plants they encounter 
while digging underground.
