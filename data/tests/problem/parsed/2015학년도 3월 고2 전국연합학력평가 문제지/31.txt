31. Compared with farmers, hunter­gatherers led a more       
life. Modern anthropologists who have spent 
time with surviving hunter­gatherer groups report that 
gathering food only accounts for a small proportion of their 
time ― far less than would be required to produce the same 
quantity of food via farming. The !Kung Bushmen of the 
Kalahari, for example, typically spend twelve to nineteen 
hours a week collecting food, and the Hazda nomads of 
Tanzania spend less than fourteen hours. That leaves a lot 
of time free for leisure activities, socializing, and so on. 
When asked by an anthropologist why his people had not 
adopted farming, one Bushman replied, “Why should we 
plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?” 
In effect, hunter­gatherers work two days a week and have 
five­day weekends. [3점]
