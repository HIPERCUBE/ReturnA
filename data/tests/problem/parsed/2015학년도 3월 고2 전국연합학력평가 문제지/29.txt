When my daughter, Isabella, was five years old, we were 
living in Washington, D.C. One day, we were volunteering at 
Children of Mine, a center for children in need. The day 
before, we had celebrated ① her fifth birthday with a cake, 
presents, balloons, and a birthday party. By chance, at the 
center that day there was a little girl also having her fifth 
birthday. ② Her entire birthday celebration consisted of a 
chocolate chip cookie with a candle. I remember watching 
my daughter from across the room, her eyes welling with 
tears. Something clicked for her, something that I could not 
have taught ③ her. When we returned home, Isabella rushed 
to her room, collected all the presents she had got for her 
birthday, and told me that ④ she wanted to take them to the 
little girl. Now it’s not as if Isabella was suddenly 
transformed into Mother Teresa ― she has had many 
moments of selfishness since then. But it was a profound 
moment, whose impact will always be with ⑤ her.
