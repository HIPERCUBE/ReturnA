20. Emotions usually get a bad reputation. They are often 
seen as something to be regulated or managed. People even 
think emotions are harmful if they get out of control. 
However, all emotions have a point. They played an 
important part in our evolutionary history and helped us 
survive. For example, by seeing disgust on someone’s face 
when presented with moldy food, we were able to avoid 
eating something dangerous. By communicating happiness, we 
were able to develop beneficial social interactions. Even 
anger was an important emotion to our ancestors, motivating 
us to seek food when we were hungry, to fight off 
predators and to compete for scarce resources.
