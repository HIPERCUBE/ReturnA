Some researchers assumed early human beings ate mainly 
the muscle flesh of animals, as we ① do today. By “meat,” 
they meant the muscle of the animal. Yet focusing on the 
muscle appears to be a ② relatively recent phenomenon. In 
every history on the subject, the evidence suggests that 
early human populations ③ preferred the fat and organ meat 
of the animal over its muscle meat. Vihjalmur Stefansson, an 
arctic explorer, found that the Inuit were careful to save 
fatty meat and organs for human consumption ④ while giving  
muscle meat to the dogs. In this way, humans ate as other 
large, meat­eating mammals eat. Lions and tigers, for 
instance, first eat the blood, hearts, livers, and brains of the 
animals they kill, often ⑤ leave the muscle meat for eagles. 
These organs tend to be much higher in fat.
