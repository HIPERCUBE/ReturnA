38. 
This has happened with an Aboriginal language of South 
Australia called Kaurna.
Even an extinct language can be brought back to life, if 
conditions are right. There must be people who want the 
language back. ( ① ) Also, there must be written or 
audio­recorded material of the language in some form. ( ② ) 
Its last native speaker died in 1929, but in the 1980s a 
group of people decided that they wanted their language 
back. ( ③ ) “The language isn’t dead,” the leader of the 
group said, “it’s only sleeping.” ( ④ ) Fortunately, material 
survived from the nineteenth century, so that a linguist was 
able to make a fresh description and help the Kaurna people 
start learning the language again. ( ⑤ ) It’s taught in 
schools now, and some day, perhaps, some children will 
start learning it as their mother tongue.
