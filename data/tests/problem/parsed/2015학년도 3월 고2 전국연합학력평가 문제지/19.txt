One afternoon, as I wandered around the shops near my 
hotel, I saw a poor gypsy woman sitting on the sidewalk 
outside the subway station. She looked tired and lonely, and 
her eyes were fixed firmly on the ground. A young toddler 
played at her feet merrily, not knowing her mother’s 
sadness. Then, a young woman who worked at a nearby 
tourist shop came out of the shop, holding some food. She 
went over to the gypsy woman, smiled at the child and 
handed over the food. While the shop assistant was happily 
responding to the toddler’s playful touches, I saw a smile 
flashing across the gypsy woman’s face. It was a 
heartwarming moment. That day I learned a lesson in human 
kindness.
