When it comes to salt and sweets, there’s little a parent 
can do to change a child’s inborn desire for them, which 
begins early in infancy. (A) , there is some evidence 
that early diet can at least change the circumstances in 
which children will seek out sweet and salty flavors. As 
early as six months of age, babies who have been exposed 
more often to salted food show a stronger preference for 
salted cereal than babies with less salt experience. 
(B) , six­month­old babies who have been fed sugar 
water tend to drink more of it than babies not previously 
exposed to it. This effect lasts a surprisingly long time, 
because even if the parents stop giving their baby sugar 
water by six months of age, she will continue to show a 
greater preference for it at age two.
