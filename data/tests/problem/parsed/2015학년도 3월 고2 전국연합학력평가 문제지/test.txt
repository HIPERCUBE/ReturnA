When human beings take in excess energy in the form of 
food at a given meal or snack, the extra calories tend to 
reduce hunger at the next meal or snack. But this 
mechanism doesn’t seem to be fully functional when excess 
calories are consumed in the form of liquids. If, for example, 
you begin taking in an extra 200 calories a day by eating a 
sandwich, you’ll tend to reduce your caloric intake by the 
same amount at the next meal or over the course of the 
day. On the other hand, if you take in an extra 200 calories 
by drinking a soft drink, your body won’t activate the same 
mechanism, and you probably won’t end up reducing your 
daily caloric intake at all. In the long run, you’ll end up 
gaining weight.
* mechanism: 작동 방식
① 식전에 물을 마시면 식사량을 줄일 수 있다. 
② 칼로리 섭취를 줄이면 노화를 늦출 수 있다.
③ 일일 적정 칼로리 섭취량은 사람에 따라 다르다.
④ 식사를 규칙적으로 하면 기초 대사량이 높아진다.
⑤ 음료를 통해 초과 섭취된 칼로리는 체중을 늘릴 수 있다.
19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
One afternoon, as I wandered around the shops near my 
hotel, I saw a poor gypsy woman sitting on the sidewalk 
outside the subway station. She looked tired and lonely, and 
her eyes were fixed firmly on the ground. A young toddler 
played at her feet merrily, not knowing her mother’s 
sadness. Then, a young woman who worked at a nearby 
tourist shop came out of the shop, holding some food. She 
went over to the gypsy woman, smiled at the child and 
handed over the food. While the shop assistant was happily 
responding to the toddler’s playful touches, I saw a smile 
flashing across the gypsy woman’s face. It was a 
heartwarming moment. That day I learned a lesson in human 
kindness.

20. Emotions usually get a bad reputation. They are often 
seen as something to be regulated or managed. People even 
think emotions are harmful if they get out of control. 
However, all emotions have a point. They played an 
important part in our evolutionary history and helped us 
survive. For example, by seeing disgust on someone’s face 
when presented with moldy food, we were able to avoid 
eating something dangerous. By communicating happiness, we 
were able to develop beneficial social interactions. Even 
anger was an important emotion to our ancestors, motivating 
us to seek food when we were hungry, to fight off 
predators and to compete for scarce resources.
* moldy: 곰팡이가 낀
① reasons we need to hide our emotions
② difficulties of reading others’ emotions
③ contributions of emotions to human survival
④ ways of expressing emotions in different cultures
⑤ differences between emotional and physical responses
21. No Stone Age ten­year­old would have been living on 
tender foods like modern potato chips, hamburgers, and 
pasta. Their meals would have required far more chewing 
than is ever demanded of a modern child. Insufficient use of 
jaw muscles in the early years of modern life may result in 
their underdevelopment and in weaker and smaller bone 
structure. The growth of human teeth requires a jaw 
structure of a certain size and shape, one that might not be 
produced if usage during development is inadequate. Crowded 
and misplaced incisors and imperfect wisdom teeth may be 
diseases of civilization. Perhaps many dental problems would 
be prevented if more biting were encouraged for children.
[3점]
* incisor: 앞니    ** wisdom tooth: 사랑니
① home remedies for wisdom tooth pain
② effects of chewing on brain development
③ modern dental problems from not chewing enough
④ the importance of dental care education at school
⑤ the technological development of dental treatments

22. You might be surprised to learn that most kids would 
rather have parents that are a little too strict than not strict 
enough. When they make rules about your behavior, your 
parents are showing you they really care about the things 
you do. Learning about life is a little like learning to fly an 
airplane. Once you get in the air it’s exciting, but first you 
need to know which buttons to press and which ones to 
leave alone. If your flight instructor puts you in a plane and 
says, “Figure out the rules yourself. Good luck!” you know 
you’re in trouble. It’s the same with parents.
① Praise: The Best Food for Kids
② Youth Is the Time of Adventure
③ Parental Rules Help Kids Fly High
④ Generous Parents Make Kids Smart
⑤ Peer Pressure: Beneficial or Harmful?
23. If you watch airline attendants when flight safety 
instructions are being given, you’ll notice that they hold the 
life jacket, oxygen mask, and other demonstration materials 
like pieces of art being auctioned at Christie’s. Why? 
Because it draws attention to those items and conveys their 
importance. According to a large restaurant owner, his 
servers are taught to present trays of food to customers 
with both hands and with respect. Doing so leaves others 
with a more favorable impression of the server and the 
restaurant. The same principle applies to anything you hold 
while speaking in public. Whether it is a piece of paper, a 
workbook, or a product, if you want to let your audience 
know what you are holding is important, handle the item 
with respect and care. 
* Christie’s: 크리스티 (미술품ㆍ골동품) 경매
① Give Away to Earn Money
② Be Creative to Draw Attention
③ Believe in Yourself to Persuade Others
④ Touch Your Audience with Personal Stories
⑤ Demonstrate Importance with Respect and Care
24. pocket gopher에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? 
Pocket gophers include several species that range across 
the western half of the United States. They prefer habitats 
where the earth is soft and easy to dig in, and they spend 
most of their time underground. As many as seven young 
are born in the spring. As soon as they are weaned, they 
dig burrows of their own and begin life alone. Mature 
gophers are 6 - 13 inches long and weigh up to a pound. 
Their bodies are fur covered except for a short thick tail. 
Gophers eat roots and other parts of plants they encounter 
while digging underground.
* wean: 젖을 떼다
① 부드러운 흙이 있는 곳을 서식지로 선호한다.
② 새끼는 젖을 떼자마자 독립한다.
③ 성장하면 무게가 1파운드까지 나간다. 
④ 털이 무성한 긴 꼬리가 있다.
⑤ 식물성 먹이를 먹는다.

The above graph shows the U.S. market shares of fruit 
imports by type in 1999 and 2010. ①Overall, the market 
shares of all types of fruit imports increased between 1999 
and 2010. ② In 1999, the market share of imported fresh fruit 
was twice as much as that of imported dried fruit. ③Between 
1999 and 2010, the market share of imported frozen fruit 
showed the largest growth among the five types. ④ In both 
1999 and 2010, imported dried fruit had the smallest market 
share among the five types. ⑤ The market shares of imported 
canned fruit and fruit juice were above 30 percent in 2010.

Some researchers assumed early human beings ate mainly 
the muscle flesh of animals, as we ① do today. By “meat,” 
they meant the muscle of the animal. Yet focusing on the 
muscle appears to be a ② relatively recent phenomenon. In 
every history on the subject, the evidence suggests that 
early human populations ③ preferred the fat and organ meat 
of the animal over its muscle meat. Vihjalmur Stefansson, an 
arctic explorer, found that the Inuit were careful to save 
fatty meat and organs for human consumption ④ while giving  
muscle meat to the dogs. In this way, humans ate as other 
large, meat­eating mammals eat. Lions and tigers, for 
instance, first eat the blood, hearts, livers, and brains of the 
animals they kill, often ⑤ leave the muscle meat for eagles. 
These organs tend to be much higher in fat.

When my daughter, Isabella, was five years old, we were 
living in Washington, D.C. One day, we were volunteering at 
Children of Mine, a center for children in need. The day 
before, we had celebrated ① her fifth birthday with a cake, 
presents, balloons, and a birthday party. By chance, at the 
center that day there was a little girl also having her fifth 
birthday. ② Her entire birthday celebration consisted of a 
chocolate chip cookie with a candle. I remember watching 
my daughter from across the room, her eyes welling with 
tears. Something clicked for her, something that I could not 
have taught ③ her. When we returned home, Isabella rushed 
to her room, collected all the presents she had got for her 
birthday, and told me that ④ she wanted to take them to the 
little girl. Now it’s not as if Isabella was suddenly 
transformed into Mother Teresa ― she has had many 
moments of selfishness since then. But it was a profound 
moment, whose impact will always be with ⑤ her.

Most of us play it safe by putting our needs aside when 
faced with the possibility of feeling guilty or disappointing 
others. At work you may (A) allow / forbid  a complaining 
coworker to keep stealing your energy to avoid conflict ―
ending up hating your job. At home you may say yes to 
family members who give you a hard time to avoid their 
emotional rejection, only to feel (B) frustrated / satisfied  by 
the lack of quality time that you have for yourself. We work 
hard to manage the perceptions of others, (C) ignoring /  
fulfilling  our own needs, and in the end we give up the 
very thing that will enable us to live meaningful lives. 
(A)              (B)              (C)
① allow …… frustrated …… ignoring
② allow …… frustrated …… fulfilling
③ allow …… satisfied …… fulfilling

31. Compared with farmers, hunter­gatherers led a more       
life. Modern anthropologists who have spent 
time with surviving hunter­gatherer groups report that 
gathering food only accounts for a small proportion of their 
time ― far less than would be required to produce the same 
quantity of food via farming. The !Kung Bushmen of the 
Kalahari, for example, typically spend twelve to nineteen 
hours a week collecting food, and the Hazda nomads of 
Tanzania spend less than fourteen hours. That leaves a lot 
of time free for leisure activities, socializing, and so on. 
When asked by an anthropologist why his people had not 
adopted farming, one Bushman replied, “Why should we 
plant, when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?” 
In effect, hunter­gatherers work two days a week and have 
five­day weekends. [3점]

① leisurely ② systematic ③ dangerous
④ stressful ⑤ isolated
32. A human system of regulating flow is almost always more 
responsive than a mechanical one. Have you ever had to 
wait in a car at a red light when there was a lot of traffic 
on your street and none on the cross street? A policeman 
would immediately see the situation and adjust the 
directional flow to meet the momentary need. The same 
applies to rigid rules in a meeting. It is hard to get a 
constructive dialogue going when the participants are only 
allowed to speak in a fixed order. A human system ― a 
sensitive moderator ― could adjust to the moment­by­moment 
needs of the individuals in the group without letting anyone 
dominate the meeting for long. Clearly, every meeting of 
more than four or five people needs a leader who will       
. [3점]
① sacrifice his or her own needs
② serve as a source of information
③ keep a balanced conversational flow
④ stick to the fixed rules of the group
⑤ appreciate the hard work of the members
33. Jacqueline Novogratz, the founder of the Acumen Fund, 
tells a story that                                       . 
Her story centers on a blue sweater. It was given to her by 
her uncle Ed when she was twelve. “I loved that soft wool 
sweater with its striped sleeves and two zebras in the 
front,” she says. She even wrote her name on the tag. But 
the sweater got too tight for her as she grew older. So in 
her freshman year of high school she donated it to a 
charity. Eleven years later, she was jogging in Kigali, 
Rwanda, where she was working to set up an aid program 
for poor women. Suddenly, she spotted a little boy wearing 
a similar sweater. Could it be? She ran over to him and 
checked out the tag. Yes, there was her name. It was 
enough to remind Jacqueline ― and the rest of us ― of the 
threads of our connection to one another.
① demonstrates how connected we all are
② reminds us of the relative value of time
③ describes a hard life with a happy ending
④ emphasizes the importance of women’s roles
⑤ shows how many opportunities there are in Africa

[3점]
When it comes to salt and sweets, there’s little a parent 
can do to change a child’s inborn desire for them, which 
begins early in infancy. (A) , there is some evidence 
that early diet can at least change the circumstances in 
which children will seek out sweet and salty flavors. As 
early as six months of age, babies who have been exposed 
more often to salted food show a stronger preference for 
salted cereal than babies with less salt experience. 
(B) , six­month­old babies who have been fed sugar 
water tend to drink more of it than babies not previously 
exposed to it. This effect lasts a surprisingly long time, 
because even if the parents stop giving their baby sugar 
water by six months of age, she will continue to show a 
greater preference for it at age two.

Human beings have always had the capacity to think 
spatially ― this is here, that is there ― even though not 
everybody chooses to express this understanding in 
mapmaking. ① The capacity to form mental maps must have 
been essential for the early humans. ② Hunter­gatherers, for 
instance, recognized the routes of the migratory animals and 
the best places to hunt them down even without a physical 
map. ③ Wandering tribesmen needed to know how they 
could cross deserts safely without dying of thirst. ④ Before 
the invention of printing from wood blocks, maps were 
drawn on sheepskin or other suitable material and could be 
reproduced only by hand copying. ⑤ All these people would 
have carried a map of their land in their head.

A Greek historian Herodotus wrote of cinnamon which 
he had learned about from the Phoenicians.
(A) This story is perhaps unlikely. For those who traded 
this spice to people from far­off lands, however, such 
an exaggerated tale of hardship may have increased a 
product’s value to the consumer. 
(B) When the birds picked up the food and returned to their 
nest, the weight of the meat broke the nest and the 
cinnamon fell down the mountain, where the Arabians 
ran to pick it up. The spice was then exported to other 
countries.
(C) The Phoenicians had claimed that cinnamon sticks were 
brought to Arabia by large birds that carried them to 
their nests on mountain cliffs. In order to get the 
cinnamon, Arabians cut up the bodies of large animals 
and placed them on the ground near the nests.

When you purchase an item, you are paying not just 
for the item, but the costs to get that item to you. 
(A) When you buy that tomato at a supermarket, however, 
there are a number of costs that result in you paying 
much more than you would pay the farmer. 
(B) Let’s say you visit a farm and buy a tomato. It might 
cost the farmer very little to grow a tomato, so the 
farmer might be able to sell you a tomato for much less 
than it would cost in the supermarket and still make a 
nice profit. 
(C) That tomato has to be transported to the store; the 
store must pay rent, electric bills, and employee wages; 
and the store advertises tomatoes in its weekly 
newspaper ad.

This has happened with an Aboriginal language of South 
Australia called Kaurna.
Even an extinct language can be brought back to life, if 
conditions are right. There must be people who want the 
language back. ( ① ) Also, there must be written or 
audio­recorded material of the language in some form. ( ② ) 
Its last native speaker died in 1929, but in the 1980s a 
group of people decided that they wanted their language 
back. ( ③ ) “The language isn’t dead,” the leader of the 
group said, “it’s only sleeping.” ( ④ ) Fortunately, material 
survived from the nineteenth century, so that a linguist was 
able to make a fresh description and help the Kaurna people 
start learning the language again. ( ⑤ ) It’s taught in 
schools now, and some day, perhaps, some children will 
start learning it as their mother tongue.

Dying hair blond, for instance, was a common practice 
among ancient Roman men, as it was believed that blond 
hair provided a more youthful appearance.
There has been a huge rise in popularity of male grooming 
products. ( ① ) Men all over the world are spending billions 
of dollars on everything from cosmetics to plastic surgery. 
( ② ) As to the reason for men’s grooming, experts say 
that men consider their appearance as an important factor 
for social success. ( ③ ) Experts further searched the 
history of men’s grooming for such cases in various 
countries. ( ④ ) Similarly, ancient Egyptian men regularly 
shaved their body hair and applied various cosmetics to their 
skin. ( ⑤ ) We could say appearance was important to men 
in the past and it certainly is to men in the present.

Sometimes children may want to do more than they 
are capable of doing. For example, the five­year­old son 
of a friend of ours went on a hike with his father. At 
one point the boy asked his father to let him carry a 
heavy backpack the way the “big people” do. Without 
saying a word, the father took his backpack off and 
handed it to his son, who immediately discovered that it 
was too heavy for him to carry. The boy simply 
exclaimed, “Dad, it’s too heavy for me.” He then went 
happily on his way up the trail. In a safe way the father 
had allowed his son to discover experientially that he 
was, indeed, too small. He had also avoided a potential 
argument with his son.

Noise pollution can take many forms. In writing, one 
of the major sources of unwelcome noise actually doesn’t 
make a sound, but it can become deafening. You may 
have often heard that typing an e­mail or other writings 
in all capital letters “shouts” your message to your 
readers. Perhaps this is so, because the mere size alone 
of every letter emphasizes its importance. But bigger is 
not necessarily better and the same applies to writing.  
The true problem with trying to read all capital letters 
is just that: It’s difficult. A line or two, perhaps even a 
short paragraph, is fine when you want to emphasize an 
idea or express a warning. However, if you write a 
whole essay in all capital letters, it annoys the reader. 
In elementary school, we learned to read in upper­ and 
lowercase. As adults we continue this practice, and so 
do the major newspapers, textbooks, journals, and 
magazines we read. Even the dialogue of some comic 
books is printed in upper­ and lowercase. Also, typing 
words in all capital letters makes primary information 
indistinguishable from the rest of the text, supporting 
and secondary details. What’s of major importance? 
What’s not? Typing in all capital letters often indicates 
that the writer              the reader.
* uppercase: 대문자    ** lowercase: 소문자

[43 ~ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
It was a beautiful September morning. In fact, it was 
much too nice a day to remain indoors. So Mr. Brooks 
decided to spend time in the outside yard. Once outside, 
he noticed Michelle, Jimmy, and Dwight moving toward 
the sandpit, and he joined ⒜ them. While the bright sun 
warmed the back of his neck, he began nodding beside 
the sandpit.
(B)
The kids were very excited and were imitating the 
noise of the truck lift: “Whirr!” “Whirr!” “Whirr!” As the 
dumpster reached its peak and the trash fell into the 
truck, the kids seemed to reach their own peak of 
excitement. ⒝ They waved and “whirred” nearly at the 
same time. At exactly this point, the garbage man outside 
the truck waved back to his admirers. The kids continued 
waving and shouting “Garbage man!” on the bars as the 
truck went down the street, far beyond ⒞ their sight.
* dumpster: 대형 쓰레기 수거함
(C)
Suddenly, Mr. Brooks heard a loud shout and turned to 
see one of the kids, Michelle, on the climbing bars. She 
was shouting and pointing over the back fence of the 
yard. She shouted: “It’s him! It’s him!” Mr. Brooks got 
curious. As he got up to go look, Jimmy and Dwight 
abandoned their toys and ran past him to the bars. Just 
as Mr. Brooks reached the bars, all of ⒟ them, including 
Michelle, began shouting: “Garbage man!” “Garbage man!”
(D)
He moved beyond the bars, peered out over the fence, 
and saw a garbage man. In fact, there were two garbage 
men out there, along with a large garbage truck. One of 
⒠ them sat behind the wheel of the truck. The other 
man had moved to the rear of the truck and seemed to 
be attaching the dumpster to a lift. He then yelled, 
“Ready,” to his partner, and the dumpster began to rise 
from the ground accompanied by a loud whirring.
