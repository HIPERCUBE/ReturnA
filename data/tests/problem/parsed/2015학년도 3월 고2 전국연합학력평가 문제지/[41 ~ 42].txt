Noise pollution can take many forms. In writing, one 
of the major sources of unwelcome noise actually doesn’t 
make a sound, but it can become deafening. You may 
have often heard that typing an e­mail or other writings 
in all capital letters “shouts” your message to your 
readers. Perhaps this is so, because the mere size alone 
of every letter emphasizes its importance. But bigger is 
not necessarily better and the same applies to writing.  
The true problem with trying to read all capital letters 
is just that: It’s difficult. A line or two, perhaps even a 
short paragraph, is fine when you want to emphasize an 
idea or express a warning. However, if you write a 
whole essay in all capital letters, it annoys the reader. 
In elementary school, we learned to read in upper­ and 
lowercase. As adults we continue this practice, and so 
do the major newspapers, textbooks, journals, and 
magazines we read. Even the dialogue of some comic 
books is printed in upper­ and lowercase. Also, typing 
words in all capital letters makes primary information 
indistinguishable from the rest of the text, supporting 
and secondary details. What’s of major importance? 
What’s not? Typing in all capital letters often indicates 
that the writer              the reader.
* uppercase: 대문자    ** lowercase: 소문자
