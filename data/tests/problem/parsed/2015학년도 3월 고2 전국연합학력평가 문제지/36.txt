A Greek historian Herodotus wrote of cinnamon which 
he had learned about from the Phoenicians.
(A) This story is perhaps unlikely. For those who traded 
this spice to people from far­off lands, however, such 
an exaggerated tale of hardship may have increased a 
product’s value to the consumer. 
(B) When the birds picked up the food and returned to their 
nest, the weight of the meat broke the nest and the 
cinnamon fell down the mountain, where the Arabians 
ran to pick it up. The spice was then exported to other 
countries.
(C) The Phoenicians had claimed that cinnamon sticks were 
brought to Arabia by large birds that carried them to 
their nests on mountain cliffs. In order to get the 
cinnamon, Arabians cut up the bodies of large animals 
and placed them on the ground near the nests.
