(A)
It was a beautiful September morning. In fact, it was 
much too nice a day to remain indoors. So Mr. Brooks 
decided to spend time in the outside yard. Once outside, 
he noticed Michelle, Jimmy, and Dwight moving toward 
the sandpit, and he joined ⒜ them. While the bright sun 
warmed the back of his neck, he began nodding beside 
the sandpit.
(B)
The kids were very excited and were imitating the 
noise of the truck lift: “Whirr!” “Whirr!” “Whirr!” As the 
dumpster reached its peak and the trash fell into the 
truck, the kids seemed to reach their own peak of 
excitement. ⒝ They waved and “whirred” nearly at the 
same time. At exactly this point, the garbage man outside 
the truck waved back to his admirers. The kids continued 
waving and shouting “Garbage man!” on the bars as the 
truck went down the street, far beyond ⒞ their sight.
* dumpster: 대형 쓰레기 수거함
(C)
Suddenly, Mr. Brooks heard a loud shout and turned to 
see one of the kids, Michelle, on the climbing bars. She 
was shouting and pointing over the back fence of the 
yard. She shouted: “It’s him! It’s him!” Mr. Brooks got 
curious. As he got up to go look, Jimmy and Dwight 
abandoned their toys and ran past him to the bars. Just 
as Mr. Brooks reached the bars, all of ⒟ them, including 
Michelle, began shouting: “Garbage man!” “Garbage man!”
(D)
He moved beyond the bars, peered out over the fence, 
and saw a garbage man. In fact, there were two garbage 
men out there, along with a large garbage truck. One of 
⒠ them sat behind the wheel of the truck. The other 
man had moved to the rear of the truck and seemed to 
be attaching the dumpster to a lift. He then yelled, 
“Ready,” to his partner, and the dumpster began to rise 
from the ground accompanied by a loud whirring.
