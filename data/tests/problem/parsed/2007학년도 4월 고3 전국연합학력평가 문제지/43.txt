43.  A trip to the beach means sand between your toes, salt water 
in your mouth and the aromatic sea air in your nose. But what 
gives the ocean air that delightful and distinctive smell? 
Scientists have not known the full story until now. The smell 
comes from a gas produced by genes recently identified by 
researchers in ocean-dwelling bacteria. Understanding how the 
odorous gas is produced could be important because it helps 
some animals find food. Scientists had long known that bacteria 
could be found consuming decay products and producing a gas 
called dimethyl sulfide (DMS), in places where plankton and 
marine plants such as seaweed were dying. This pungent gas is 
what gives ocean air “sort of a fishy, tangy smell,” said study 
author Andrew Johnston.
