From this page, you will be able to leave feedback for products 
you bought for other uBay members. Remember, uBay only 
awards feedback points for items purchased within 90 days. If it 
is greater than 90 days, you will not be able to leave feedback on 
this page. Please keep in mind that the uBay feedback system 
does not allow you to leave feedback for someone who is not 
registered as an uBay member. If you need to leave feedback for 
a transaction that is more than 90 days, you may do so using the 
“single transaction form” link located on the Post Leave Feedback 
(PLF) page. However, uBay does not award points for the 
feedback on the PLF page.
