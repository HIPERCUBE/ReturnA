35.  Frustrations are among life’s most unpleasant experiences; 
they result in anxiety and other disagreeable emotions. To 
escape from this anxiety, we behave in various ways to relieve 
our frustrations. Unfortunately, however, some of these 
behaviors can result in even greater anxiety or stress. As 
mentioned earlier, frustration is a universal experience. 
Reactions to frustration also appear to be universal. That is, we 
can observe similar reactions in many different kinds of 
societies. However, certain reactions may not be as socially 
acceptable in one culture as in another culture. For instance, all 
people, when frustrated, may respond with anger. However, in 
some cultures, such as in the Asian culture, anger should not be 
displayed publicly, while in other cultures displaying anger in 
front of others is more acceptable.

A village of small houses that may have sheltered the people 
attending festivals at the mysterious Stonehenge has been found 
by archaeologists studying the stone circle in England. Eight of 
the houses, with central hearths, have been excavated. The 
ancient houses are at a site known as Durrington Walls, about 
two miles from Stonehenge. It is also the location of a wooden 
version of the stone circle. The village was carbon dated to about 
2600 B.C. about the same time Stonehenge was built. Both

42.  Two new studies give one more reason to eat a diet rich in 
fish: prevention of age-related macular degeneration, the leading 
cause of blindness in old age. The omega-3 fatty acids found in 
fish such as salmon are already known to help the heart and brain 
stay healthy. The new studies add to the evidence that eating 
fish protects the eyes. The new studies aren’t the strongest level 
of scientific evidence, but they confirm the findings of previous 
studies that link consumption with prevention of macular 
degeneration. A study showed that those who ate fish twice a 
week had a 36 percent lower risk of macular degeneration. In the 
other study, people who ate fish just once a week reduced their 
risk by 40 percent.

Straddling the Equator on the east coast of Africa, Kenya is one 
of the most scenically diverse and beautiful countries on the 
continent, and home to the nomadic Masai and Samburu, the 
Kikuyu farmers and coastal Swahili tribal peoples. ( ① ) What 
really draws the tourists is the great outdoors. ( ② ) This is a 
place for sunbathing, hiking, climbing, diving or riding. ( ③ ) The 
scenery is fabulous ― from the indigo sea and white sand 
beaches to the grey-green rolling bushveld of Tsavo and 
Amboseli. ( ④ ) Corruption riddles the land, the crime rate is 
high and malaria and AIDS are widespread. ( ⑤ ) Despite this, 
the people are friendly, and the tourist trade is supremely 
well-organized and professional.

Remember the story of the child who put Limburger cheese 
on his father’s mustache while he was sleeping? His father 
awoke and exclaimed, “This room stinks!” He walked into the 
kitchen, sniffed around and declared, “The kitchen stinks, too!”
Then he walked around the whole house and concluded, “This 
whole house stinks!” Desperately wanting fresh air, he ran out 
the front door, breathed in deeply and proclaimed, “My Lord! 
The whole world stinks!” That humorous story has a profound

Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body

Person  A   As governor of Texas, I will do everything in my 
power to protect public health. The executive order I signed 
will help stop the spread of human papillomavirus (HPV) and 
prevent cervical cancer in young women. Some are focused on 
the cause of this cancer, but I remain focused on the cure. For 
the first time in history, a vaccine exists that can prevent a 
deadly cancer — the second most common form of cancer in 
women. The HPV vaccine is approved by the U.S Food and
