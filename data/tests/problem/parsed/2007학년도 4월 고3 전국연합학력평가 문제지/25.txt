25.   There was an old man who was intensely proud of two 
things, his long, white beard that reached down to his chest, and 
his ability to sleep the moment his head touched the pillow. One 
day, his grandson asked, “How do you arrange your beard when 
you sleep? Does it go under or above the blanket?” The old man 
had never paid attention to this detail. He promised to find out. 
The old man got into bed and pulled the blanket over himself that 
night. Then he suddenly remembered his grandson’s question. He 
became acutely conscious that his beard was under the blanket. 
He lifted it and placed it above the blanket. But he soon felt it 
would be better if it were in. In and out went the beard; first 
under the blanket, then above it, then under once again. The old 
man                                       .
