24.  Amy was nine months old when she took her first step alone. 
She would take one tiny step, then teeter and fall. Her mom 
always said the same words, “You’re such a big girl now! Good 
job!” Each time she fell, Amy would glance at her parents, who 
would laugh lightly and say, “Come on, let’s try again. I know you 
can come over here to me.” And without shedding a tear or 
showing alarm, Amy would push herself up and try again. The 
focus was on the tiny successful steps alone rather than the many 
falls that Amy experienced. Each expression of                        
seemed to reinforce the idea that she was doing something very   
special indeed.
