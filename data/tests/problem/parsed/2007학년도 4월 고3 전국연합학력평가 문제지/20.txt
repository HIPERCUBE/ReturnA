We live today in a world that is as deeply devoted to material 
things as was the late Roman world. For example, the Romans of 
the fourth century were obsessed by health, diet, exercise and 
law courts. ① They spent more time in baths and health clubs 
than in churches, temples, and libraries. ② They hoped to 
become richer in the spiritual aspect. ③ They were devoted to 
consumption. ④ A man could make a reputation by spending more 
than his neighbor, even if he had to borrow the money to do it. 
⑤ And even though he never paid back his creditors, he was 
honored for having made a noble attempt to look very elegant in 
the world.
