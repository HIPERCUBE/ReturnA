42.  Two new studies give one more reason to eat a diet rich in 
fish: prevention of age-related macular degeneration, the leading 
cause of blindness in old age. The omega-3 fatty acids found in 
fish such as salmon are already known to help the heart and brain 
stay healthy. The new studies add to the evidence that eating 
fish protects the eyes. The new studies aren’t the strongest level 
of scientific evidence, but they confirm the findings of previous 
studies that link consumption with prevention of macular 
degeneration. A study showed that those who ate fish twice a 
week had a 36 percent lower risk of macular degeneration. In the 
other study, people who ate fish just once a week reduced their 
risk by 40 percent.
