40.  Breakfast has always been regarded as the most important 
meal of the day. But hampered by busy schedules, many people 
neglect breakfast or choose to skip it entirely. According to a 
survey done by Asian Food Information Center (AFIC), a 
substantial number of us are following the trend common in 
industrialized countries. Eating breakfast not only starts your day 
right, it also lays the foundation for lifelong health benefits. In 
the Unites States, a study done by Linda Van Horn found that 
people who ate breakfast had a 35 to 50 percent lower rate of 
insulin resistance compared to those who skipped. Insulin 
resistance is a marker for diabetes and heart disease. A morning 
meal can also help you lose weight.
