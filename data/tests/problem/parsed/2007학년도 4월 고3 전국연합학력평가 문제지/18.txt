It has several related meanings. It today may be someone of 
noted celebrity status, with larger than life accomplishments, 
whose fame is well-known. Another meaning of it is a literary 
genre. In this capacity, the term is overused and synonymously 
used with myth and history. However, it differs from myth, 
because myth focuses on explaining natural phenomena and 
answering questions about why things are the way they are in 
the natural world, whereas it is focused on individuals and their 
accomplishments. Finally, it is separated from history by the fact 
that its content, once believed to have been true, turns out to be 
fictional.
