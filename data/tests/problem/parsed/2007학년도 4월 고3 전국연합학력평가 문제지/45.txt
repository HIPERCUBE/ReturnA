말로 가장 적절한 것끼리 짝지은 것은? [3점]
Remember the story of the child who put Limburger cheese 
on his father’s mustache while he was sleeping? His father 
awoke and exclaimed, “This room stinks!” He walked into the 
kitchen, sniffed around and declared, “The kitchen stinks, too!”
Then he walked around the whole house and concluded, “This 
whole house stinks!” Desperately wanting fresh air, he ran out 
the front door, breathed in deeply and proclaimed, “My Lord! 
The whole world stinks!” That humorous story has a profound 
message. What’s inside of us determines our relationships with 
others. Our inner turmoil, hatred or pain affect the whole world 
around us.

(A)
Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body 
building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the 
end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what’s more, 
he felt really good about himself. So on the following Monday, 
when Big John once again got on the bus and said, “Big John 
doesn’t pay!,” the driver stood up, glared back at (a) the 
passenger, and screamed, “And why not?” With a surprised look 
on his face, Big John replied, “Big John has a bus pass.”
(B)
One fine day, a bus driver went to the bus garage, started his 
bus, and drove off along the route. No problems for the first 
few stops ― a few people got on, a few got off, and things went 
generally well. At the next stop, however, (b) a hulk of a guy
got on. Six feet eight, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down 
to the ground. (c) He glared at the driver and said, “Big John 
doesn’t pay!” and sat down at the back. Did I mention that the 
driver was five feet three, thin, and basically meek? Well, he 
was. Naturally, he didn’t argue with Big John, but he wasn’t
happy about it.
(C)
The next day the same thing happened ― (d) Big John got on 
again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. The next 
day, and the one after that, and so forth. This irritated the bus 
driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was 
taking advantage of (e) him.

[49-50] 두 사람의 대립된 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Person  A   As governor of Texas, I will do everything in my 
power to protect public health. The executive order I signed 
will help stop the spread of human papillomavirus (HPV) and 
prevent cervical cancer in young women. Some are focused on 
the cause of this cancer, but I remain focused on the cure. For 
the first time in history, a vaccine exists that can prevent a 
deadly cancer — the second most common form of cancer in 
women. The HPV vaccine is approved by the U.S Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA). Research shows that the HPV 
vaccine is highly effective in protecting women against the four 
leading cancer-causing strains of HPV. Though some might 
argue that we should wait several years, I believe such a delay 
unnecessarily risks the lives of young women.
Person  B   I believe the governor of Texas has overstepped 
his bounds. I object to his order to cure the cervical cancer in 
young women with this vaccine. This should not be a 
governmental decision. As to the study itself, the research on 
humans was only done for 4 years, not long enough for cancer 
to form. 17 people died ― ten due to known causes and seven 
due to unknown causes. Merck, the maker of the vaccine, is to 
continue to conduct a research on the safety of the vaccine. It is 
unknown how long it will take to prove the safety of the 
vaccine, but it is estimated to be two to five years more from 
now. Due to the controversy over the vaccine, I insist the 
governor wait for the vaccine to prove itself perfect.
49. 위 두 글의 핵심 쟁점으로 가장 적절한 것은?
① the overturn of the research
② the instant use of HPV vaccine
③ the protection of young women
④ the cure of cancer through exercises
⑤ the vote of no-confidence in the governor
