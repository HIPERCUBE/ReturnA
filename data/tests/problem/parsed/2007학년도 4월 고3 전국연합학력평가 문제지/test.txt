24.  Amy was nine months old when she took her first step alone. 
She would take one tiny step, then teeter and fall. Her mom 
always said the same words, “You’re such a big girl now! Good 
job!” Each time she fell, Amy would glance at her parents, who 
would laugh lightly and say, “Come on, let’s try again. I know you 
can come over here to me.” And without shedding a tear or 
showing alarm, Amy would push herself up and try again. The

There’s something about a spectacular landscape that makes 
my fingers itch to capture its essence on canvas. I want to create 
a landscape painting that generates the same intense emotion in 
someone who views the painting as the landscape did in me. Here 
are some tips to help you with your next landscape painting. 
You’re not obliged to include everything that you see in the 
landscape you’re painting simply because it is there in real life. 
Be selective, include the strong elements that characterize that 
particular landscape. Use the landscape as a reference, to provide 
you with the information you need to paint the elements, but 
don’t just copy it completely.
         Carothers had developed the first synthetic fiber, called         
nylon. As it turned out, the development of nylon had a          
surprisingly profound effect on world affairs. 
(B) But they disappeared with the coming of World War II, as       
nylon became essential to the war effort. It was used in         
everything from parachutes and ropes, to insulation and         
coat linings.
(C) True, its first use was in fashion, the Dupont company began  
marketing sheer nylon hose for women. Nylons were a           
spectacular hit and sold off the shelves almost immediately.

Tides are created because the Earth and the Moon are 
① attracted to each other, just like magnets pull toward each 
other. Look at the picture above where a mother swings her child 
around in circles. The child swings around in a big circle like the 
Moon ② circling the Earth. The Moon tries to pull at anything on 
Earth to bring it ③ closer. But the Earth holds onto everything 
except the water. Since the water is always moving, the Earth 
cannot hold onto it and the Moon pulls at it. The mother swings 
in a ④ bigger circle than her child, like the rotation of the Earth. 
Her skirt flies out ⑤ behind her like water flung away from the 
Moon, similar to the high tide on Earth.

In the 1870s, the Welsh explorer Henry Morton Stanley

35.  Frustrations are among life’s most unpleasant experiences; 
they result in anxiety and other disagreeable emotions. To 
escape from this anxiety, we behave in various ways to relieve 
our frustrations. Unfortunately, however, some of these 
behaviors can result in even greater anxiety or stress. As 
mentioned earlier, frustration is a universal experience. 
Reactions to frustration also appear to be universal. That is, we 
can observe similar reactions in many different kinds of 
societies. However, certain reactions may not be as socially 
acceptable in one culture as in another culture. For instance, all 
people, when frustrated, may respond with anger. However, in 
some cultures, such as in the Asian culture, anger should not be 
displayed publicly, while in other cultures displaying anger in 
front of others is more acceptable.
① characteristics of anger ② reactions to frustration
③ tolerance of frustration ④ observation of reactions
⑤ sources of universal law

42.  Two new studies give one more reason to eat a diet rich in 
fish: prevention of age-related macular degeneration, the leading 
cause of blindness in old age. The omega-3 fatty acids found in 
fish such as salmon are already known to help the heart and brain 
stay healthy. The new studies add to the evidence that eating 
fish protects the eyes. The new studies aren’t the strongest level 
of scientific evidence, but they confirm the findings of previous 
studies that link consumption with prevention of macular 
degeneration. A study showed that those who ate fish twice a 
week had a 36 percent lower risk of macular degeneration. In the 
other study, people who ate fish just once a week reduced their 
risk by 40 percent.
① Blindness in Old Age

Straddling the Equator on the east coast of Africa, Kenya is one 
of the most scenically diverse and beautiful countries on the 
continent, and home to the nomadic Masai and Samburu, the 
Kikuyu farmers and coastal Swahili tribal peoples. ( ① ) What 
really draws the tourists is the great outdoors. ( ② ) This is a 
place for sunbathing, hiking, climbing, diving or riding. ( ③ ) The 
scenery is fabulous ― from the indigo sea and white sand 
beaches to the grey-green rolling bushveld of Tsavo and 
Amboseli. ( ④ ) Corruption riddles the land, the crime rate is 
high and malaria and AIDS are widespread. ( ⑤ ) Despite this, 
the people are friendly, and the tourist trade is supremely 
well-organized and professional.

Remember the story of the child who put Limburger cheese 
on his father’s mustache while he was sleeping? His father 
awoke and exclaimed, “This room stinks!” He walked into the 
kitchen, sniffed around and declared, “The kitchen stinks, too!”
Then he walked around the whole house and concluded, “This 
whole house stinks!” Desperately wanting fresh air, he ran out 
the front door, breathed in deeply and proclaimed, “My Lord! 
The whole world stinks!” That humorous story has a profound

Person  A   As governor of Texas, I will do everything in my

the cause of this cancer, but I remain focused on the cure. For 
the first time in history, a vaccine exists that can prevent a 
deadly cancer — the second most common form of cancer in 
women. The HPV vaccine is approved by the U.S Food and
