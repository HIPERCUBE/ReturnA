18. 밑줄 친 It(it)이 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
It has several related meanings. It today may be someone of 
noted celebrity status, with larger than life accomplishments, 
whose fame is well-known. Another meaning of it is a literary 
genre. In this capacity, the term is overused and synonymously 
used with myth and history. However, it differs from myth, 
because myth focuses on explaining natural phenomena and 
answering questions about why things are the way they are in 
the natural world, whereas it is focused on individuals and their 
accomplishments. Finally, it is separated from history by the fact 
that its content, once believed to have been true, turns out to be 
fictional.
① custom ② poetry ③ drama ④ legend ⑤ superstition
19. 밑줄 친 it이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
There are some benefits of a bike lane. First, ① it helps 
promote an orderly flow of traffic and increase the predictability 
of both motorists and bicyclists. Second, ② it helps decrease the 
stress level of bicyclists riding in traffic, and signal motorists 
that cyclists have a right to the road. Moreover, cyclists using 
the street with ③ it were less likely to ride on the sidewalk and 
were less likely to ride against the flow of traffic. Also, by 
bicyclists not blocking ④ it, drivers and riders can go to their 
destination faster. Lastly, several studies have found that 
cyclists are more comfortable and think streets having ⑤ it 
provide a better level of service for them.
20. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
We live today in a world that is as deeply devoted to material 
things as was the late Roman world. For example, the Romans of 
the fourth century were obsessed by health, diet, exercise and 
law courts. ① They spent more time in baths and health clubs 
than in churches, temples, and libraries. ② They hoped to 
become richer in the spiritual aspect. ③ They were devoted to 
consumption. ④ A man could make a reputation by spending more 
than his neighbor, even if he had to borrow the money to do it. 
⑤ And even though he never paid back his creditors, he was 
honored for having made a noble attempt to look very elegant in 
the world.

Cats were at their highest position of domesticated life in 
ancient Egypt. There were more cats (A) living / lived in Egypt 
during the time of the pharaohs than in any other place in the 
world. This high concentration of cats (B) was / were probably 
due to the laws protecting  the animal. Cats were associated with 
the moon goddess, Bast, so the Egyptians worshiped them as holy 
animals. If anyone was caught killing  a cat, the person could be put 
to death. Families in Egypt also mourned the death of a cat and 
had the body of the dead cat wrapped in cloth before it was

The latest studies indicate that ① what people really want is a 
mate that has qualities like their parents. Women are ② after a 
man who is like their father and men want to be able to see their 
own mother in the woman of their dreams. Cognitive psychologist 
David Perrett studies what makes faces ③ attractively. He has 
developed a computerized morphing system that can endlessly 
adjust faces to suit his needs. Perrett suggests that we ④ find 
our own faces charming because they remind us ⑤ of the faces 
we looked at constantly in our early childhood years ― Mom and 
Dad.

24.  Amy was nine months old when she took her first step alone. 
She would take one tiny step, then teeter and fall. Her mom 
always said the same words, “You’re such a big girl now! Good 
job!” Each time she fell, Amy would glance at her parents, who 
would laugh lightly and say, “Come on, let’s try again. I know you 
can come over here to me.” And without shedding a tear or 
showing alarm, Amy would push herself up and try again. The 
focus was on the tiny successful steps alone rather than the many 
falls that Amy experienced. Each expression of                        
seemed to reinforce the idea that she was doing something very   
special indeed.
① specialization ② sophistication
③ generalization ④ underestimation
⑤ encouragement
25.   There was an old man who was intensely proud of two 
things, his long, white beard that reached down to his chest, and 
his ability to sleep the moment his head touched the pillow. One 
day, his grandson asked, “How do you arrange your beard when 
you sleep? Does it go under or above the blanket?” The old man 
had never paid attention to this detail. He promised to find out. 
The old man got into bed and pulled the blanket over himself that 
night. Then he suddenly remembered his grandson’s question. He 
became acutely conscious that his beard was under the blanket. 
He lifted it and placed it above the blanket. But he soon felt it 
would be better if it were in. In and out went the beard; first 
under the blanket, then above it, then under once again. The old 
man                                       .
① had a sleepless night ② took pride in himself
③ dyed his beard white ④ paid attention to reading
⑤ praised his grandson much
26.  The Kalenjin runners carry certain genes which adapt them to 
dwelling in hot, dry conditions at high altitudes. They live on a 
plateau 7,000 feet above sea level. This would certainly explain 
the low heart rate. At such a high altitude, oxygen levels in the 
atmosphere start to fall. To compensate for this, the body has to 
increase the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen in the 
blood. When athletes who have trained at high altitudes come 
down to sea level to compete, they still carry extra red blood 
cells and this gives them                                  in their running. 
The heart has to beat less fast to carry the same amount of 
oxygen around the body. [3점]
① lots of good skill ② much physical fatigue
③ the strongest muscles ④ a dangerous heart disease
⑤ a huge power advantage
2 7.  Everyone knows what is supposed to happen when two Englishmen who have never met before come face to face in a 
railway compartment; they start talking about the weather. By 
talking to the other person about some neutral topic like the 
weather, it is possible to strike up a relationship with him easily. 
Conversations of this kind are the sort of important social 
function that is often fulfilled by language. Language is not 
simply a means of communicating information ― about the 
weather or any other subject. It is also a very important means 
of establishing and maintaining relationships with other people. 
Probably the most important thing about the conversation 
between the two Englishmen is not the words they are using, but 
the fact that                                               .
① they are talking each other
② they have never met before
③ they came from the same area
④ they speak different languages
⑤ they know the weather condition
28. 다음 글에 드러난 필자의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
“No problem” has been my son’s philosophy of life. Two years 
ago, he was one of the top ten underachievers in our state and 
whenever you asked him how he was doing in school, he always 
said, with simple eloquence, “No problem.” And, of course, his 
answer made sense: there was no problem, no confusion about 
how he was doing. He had failed everything; and what he hadn’t 
failed, he hadn’t taken yet. He had even failed English. His failing 
his native tongue stimulated my curiosity, so I said, “How can 
you fail English?” “No problem,” he replied. Hoping to get an 
answer that had something to do with the question, I said again, 
“Please tell me. How can you fail English?” “No problem,” he said.
① scared and horrified ② critical and cynical
③ contented and joyful ④ envious and jealous
⑤ worried and dissatisfied
29. 다음 글에서, 풍경화 그리기에 대한 필자의 주장으로 가장 적절한 
것은?
There’s something about a spectacular landscape that makes 
my fingers itch to capture its essence on canvas. I want to create 
a landscape painting that generates the same intense emotion in 
someone who views the painting as the landscape did in me. Here 
are some tips to help you with your next landscape painting. 
You’re not obliged to include everything that you see in the 
landscape you’re painting simply because it is there in real life. 
Be selective, include the strong elements that characterize that 
particular landscape. Use the landscape as a reference, to provide 
you with the information you need to paint the elements, but 
don’t just copy it completely.

As the chief designer of a global apparel company, my job 
takes me all over the world ― to meet with clients, to 
deliver presentations, to see what the competition is up to 
and to get inspiration for my designs. On my journeys, I’ve 
(A) encouraged / encountered  many beautiful pieces of art. I 
collected them like treasures, but it was a shame that I never had 
the opportunity to (B) replay / display  them. Although I rented 
an apartment in Kuala Lumpur, I spent half my time abroad, living 
from hotel to hotel. (C) Lacking / Leaking  the desire to decorate 
my landlord’s place, I left my apartment a mess. The hassle of 
moving once my lease was up was a huge roadblock for me. As a 
result, most of my collection remained packed away in storage, 
like junk.

During World War I, a number of severe shortages alerted the 
world scientists to the need for synthetic, or man-made 
materials.
(A) Thus by 1934, a research team headed by Wallace H.             
Carothers had developed the first synthetic fiber, called         
nylon. As it turned out, the development of nylon had a          
surprisingly profound effect on world affairs. 
(B) But they disappeared with the coming of World War II, as       
nylon became essential to the war effort. It was used in         
everything from parachutes and ropes, to insulation and         
coat linings.
(C) True, its first use was in fashion, the Dupont company began  
marketing sheer nylon hose for women. Nylons were a           
spectacular hit and sold off the shelves almost immediately.

3 7. Durrington Walls에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
A village of small houses that may have sheltered the people 
attending festivals at the mysterious Stonehenge has been found 
by archaeologists studying the stone circle in England. Eight of 
the houses, with central hearths, have been excavated. The 
ancient houses are at a site known as Durrington Walls, about 
two miles from Stonehenge. It is also the location of a wooden 
version of the stone circle. The village was carbon dated to about 
2600 B.C. about the same time Stonehenge was built. Both 
Stonehenge and Durrington Walls have wide roads connecting 
them to the Avon River, indicating a pattern of movement 
between the sites. The researchers speculated that Durrington 
Walls was a place for the living and Stonehenge was a cemetery 
and memorial. Stone tools, animal bones, arrowheads and other 
artifacts were uncovered in the village.

⑤ 화살촉 등 다양한 유물이 발견되었다.
38. Ultimate에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?

Ultimate is a game played by some students of the University 
of North Texas. It is a blend of the elements of basketball and 
football. The non-contact sport is played with seven players on 
each team, on an area that resembles a football field. The object 
is to advance the disc downfield by throwing and catching. 
Running with the disc is not allowed, and the player scores when 
a pass is caught in the ‘end zone.’ If the defense intercepts or 
knocks down a pass from the offense, they immediately become 
the offense going in the opposite direction. The game is played 
without referees.

⑤ 심판 없이 경기가 운영된다.

40.  Breakfast has always been regarded as the most important 
meal of the day. But hampered by busy schedules, many people 
neglect breakfast or choose to skip it entirely. According to a 
survey done by Asian Food Information Center (AFIC), a 
substantial number of us are following the trend common in 
industrialized countries. Eating breakfast not only starts your day 
right, it also lays the foundation for lifelong health benefits. In 
the Unites States, a study done by Linda Van Horn found that 
people who ate breakfast had a 35 to 50 percent lower rate of 
insulin resistance compared to those who skipped. Insulin 
resistance is a marker for diabetes and heart disease. A morning 
meal can also help you lose weight.

41.  I was once a professional violinist. I’ve played on many 
violins, and they all respond differently. The key, I’ve 
discovered, to releasing an instrument’s most beautiful sound is 
to know it so well that you simply understand what it responds to 
and what it doesn’t; which strings need tenderness and which 
withstand force; how fast or hard to draw the bow. How one 
violin responds won’t necessarily be like any other. Each has its 
own personality. People respond the same way. Their beauty 
needs to be released, not extracted, and the only way to know how 
they respond is to listen carefully and behold their true nature.

42.  Two new studies give one more reason to eat a diet rich in 
fish: prevention of age-related macular degeneration, the leading 
cause of blindness in old age. The omega-3 fatty acids found in 
fish such as salmon are already known to help the heart and brain 
stay healthy. The new studies add to the evidence that eating 
fish protects the eyes. The new studies aren’t the strongest level 
of scientific evidence, but they confirm the findings of previous 
studies that link consumption with prevention of macular 
degeneration. A study showed that those who ate fish twice a 
week had a 36 percent lower risk of macular degeneration. In the 
other study, people who ate fish just once a week reduced their 
risk by 40 percent.

43.  A trip to the beach means sand between your toes, salt water 
in your mouth and the aromatic sea air in your nose. But what 
gives the ocean air that delightful and distinctive smell? 
Scientists have not known the full story until now. The smell 
comes from a gas produced by genes recently identified by 
researchers in ocean-dwelling bacteria. Understanding how the 
odorous gas is produced could be important because it helps 
some animals find food. Scientists had long known that bacteria 
could be found consuming decay products and producing a gas 
called dimethyl sulfide (DMS), in places where plankton and 
marine plants such as seaweed were dying. This pungent gas is 
what gives ocean air “sort of a fishy, tangy smell,” said study 
author Andrew Johnston.

However, Kenya is by no means perfect.
Straddling the Equator on the east coast of Africa, Kenya is one 
of the most scenically diverse and beautiful countries on the 
continent, and home to the nomadic Masai and Samburu, the 
Kikuyu farmers and coastal Swahili tribal peoples. ( ① ) What 
really draws the tourists is the great outdoors. ( ② ) This is a 
place for sunbathing, hiking, climbing, diving or riding. ( ③ ) The 
scenery is fabulous ― from the indigo sea and white sand 
beaches to the grey-green rolling bushveld of Tsavo and 
Amboseli. ( ④ ) Corruption riddles the land, the crime rate is 
high and malaria and AIDS are widespread. ( ⑤ ) Despite this, 
the people are friendly, and the tourist trade is supremely 
well-organized and professional.

Remember the story of the child who put Limburger cheese 
on his father’s mustache while he was sleeping? His father 
awoke and exclaimed, “This room stinks!” He walked into the 
kitchen, sniffed around and declared, “The kitchen stinks, too!”
Then he walked around the whole house and concluded, “This 
whole house stinks!” Desperately wanting fresh air, he ran out 
the front door, breathed in deeply and proclaimed, “My Lord! 
The whole world stinks!” That humorous story has a profound 
message. What’s inside of us determines our relationships with 
others. Our inner turmoil, hatred or pain affect the whole world 
around us.

(A)
Finally he could stand it no longer. He signed up for body 
building courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff. By the 
end of the summer, he had become quite strong; what’s more, 
he felt really good about himself. So on the following Monday, 
when Big John once again got on the bus and said, “Big John 
doesn’t pay!,” the driver stood up, glared back at (a) the 
passenger, and screamed, “And why not?” With a surprised look 
on his face, Big John replied, “Big John has a bus pass.”
(B)
One fine day, a bus driver went to the bus garage, started his 
bus, and drove off along the route. No problems for the first 
few stops ― a few people got on, a few got off, and things went 
generally well. At the next stop, however, (b) a hulk of a guy
got on. Six feet eight, built like a wrestler, arms hanging down 
to the ground. (c) He glared at the driver and said, “Big John 
doesn’t pay!” and sat down at the back. Did I mention that the 
driver was five feet three, thin, and basically meek? Well, he 
was. Naturally, he didn’t argue with Big John, but he wasn’t
happy about it.
(C)
The next day the same thing happened ― (d) Big John got on 
again, made a show of refusing to pay, and sat down. The next 
day, and the one after that, and so forth. This irritated the bus 
driver, who started losing sleep over the way Big John was 
taking advantage of (e) him.

[49-50] 두 사람의 대립된 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Person  A   As governor of Texas, I will do everything in my 
power to protect public health. The executive order I signed 
will help stop the spread of human papillomavirus (HPV) and 
prevent cervical cancer in young women. Some are focused on 
the cause of this cancer, but I remain focused on the cure. For 
the first time in history, a vaccine exists that can prevent a 
deadly cancer — the second most common form of cancer in 
women. The HPV vaccine is approved by the U.S Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA). Research shows that the HPV 
vaccine is highly effective in protecting women against the four 
leading cancer-causing strains of HPV. Though some might 
argue that we should wait several years, I believe such a delay 
unnecessarily risks the lives of young women.
Person  B   I believe the governor of Texas has overstepped 
his bounds. I object to his order to cure the cervical cancer in 
young women with this vaccine. This should not be a 
governmental decision. As to the study itself, the research on 
humans was only done for 4 years, not long enough for cancer 
to form. 17 people died ― ten due to known causes and seven 
due to unknown causes. Merck, the maker of the vaccine, is to 
continue to conduct a research on the safety of the vaccine. It is 
unknown how long it will take to prove the safety of the 
vaccine, but it is estimated to be two to five years more from 
now. Due to the controversy over the vaccine, I insist the 
governor wait for the vaccine to prove itself perfect.
