However, Kenya is by no means perfect.
Straddling the Equator on the east coast of Africa, Kenya is one 
of the most scenically diverse and beautiful countries on the

Kikuyu farmers and coastal Swahili tribal peoples. ( ① ) What 
really draws the tourists is the great outdoors. ( ② ) This is a 
place for sunbathing, hiking, climbing, diving or riding. ( ③ ) The

beaches to the grey-green rolling bushveld of Tsavo and 
Amboseli. ( ④ ) Corruption riddles the land, the crime rate is

the people are friendly, and the tourist trade is supremely 
well-organized and professional.
