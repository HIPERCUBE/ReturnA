23. A woman in one of my seminars found that by going to 
bed early she could get up at four o’clock in the morning. 
She could then do the equivalent of a full day’s work by 
seven or eight o’clock, before the average person even got 
started. In no time at all, she was producing and earning 
double the amount of her co­workers. She was continually 
promoted and paid more money because she was getting far 
more done than anyone else. Successful people make a habit 
of getting up early, usually by 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning, 
sometimes earlier, and then getting going immediately. This 
gives them a great jump on the day. The average person, on 
the other hand, takes a full hour to get up and get going in 
the morning. Then they drag themselves off to work, 
thinking about lunchtime, and what they are going to do in 
the evening.
