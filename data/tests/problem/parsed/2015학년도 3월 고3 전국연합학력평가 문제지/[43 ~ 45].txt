(A)
Justin wished that his dad had a different job. It 
sounded so cool to say, “My dad is at the office!” 
However, Justin’s dad sold plastic souvenirs to tourists 
from a street stall. When other kids asked him, “What 
does your dad do for a living?” he always said, “(a) He 
is in business.” Then he would quickly change the 
subject before anyone could ask details about the kind of 
business in which his dad was involved.
(B)
His dad smiled. “Ever since your sixth birthday, I’ve 
put Saturdays’ earnings into a savings account for you. 
Now you can study at a college of your choice.” Justin 
felt a lump in his throat. “Thanks, Dad! I’ll work hard,” 
he promised. “I’ll get a degree and a good job and then 
(b) you won’t have to stand on windy street corners to 
sell your stuff any longer.” His dad gave him a warm 
hug.
(C)
He was also upset that his dad had to work on 
Saturdays. (c) He was never free to watch Justin play in 
soccer matches. The other dads would stand on the 
sidelines, cheering their sons, but his dad only said, 
“Enjoy the game, Justin! I wish I could be there to see 
you score the winning goal!” In the final match of the 
final season, when he had been voted man of the match, 
his dad wasn’t there to see it.
(D)
Justin dreamed of going to college one day, but (d) he 
thought it was an impossible goal. Yet he prayed about it 
regularly. On his seventeenth birthday, his dad handed 
him a big envelope. ‘What could be inside?’ he wondered. 
He hoped for money to buy new sneakers. But inside the 
envelope was a file of documents. “What’s this?” he 
asked. “Those are application forms for college,” his dad 
answered. “You can look through them and tell (e) me 
which course you want to take.” “But where will the 
money come from?” Justin asked, surprised.
