Blood pressure has to rise when we get out of bed in 
the morning, so that there is enough blood flow to the 
brain to keep us from fainting. When we sit down to 
read the morning newspaper, it goes down again. There 
is not a single, ideal level of blood pressure that our 
body tries to maintain. At the same time, it is obviously 
not to our benefit for blood pressure to get too low or 
too high, and there are mechanisms in place to keep it 
within a limited range.
I believe that a similar process occurs with human 
emotions. It is to people’s advantage to react emotionally 
to their environments, such that emotions vary from 
moment to moment. It is also to people’s advantage to 
have mechanisms in place to keep them away from the 
emotional extremes.
Think, for example, about the last time you 
experienced a state of happiness. Maybe it was the day 
you were married, or the day your child was born. You 
probably experienced a wave of pleasure rushing through 
your body. Your heart was beating rapidly, your blood 
pressure went up, and you were short of breath. Now 
imagine what it would be like to feel this way for an 
hour, a day, or a week. Sounds exhausting, doesn’t it?  
positive (or negative) emotions might have 
psychological costs, making it difficult to concentrate and 
to notice new emotional information.
