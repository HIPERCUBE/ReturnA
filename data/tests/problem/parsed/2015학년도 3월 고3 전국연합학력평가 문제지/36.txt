Sir Edward C. Burne­Jones was a prominent 
nineteenth­century English artist. One day he was invited 
to dinner at the home of his daughter.
(A) The next morning, he arrived at his daughter’s home 
with paints and palette. He went to the wall where the 
little girl had been forced to stand, and there he painted 
pictures ― a kitten chasing its tail, lambs in a field, and 
goldfish swimming.
(B) As a special treat, his young granddaughter was allowed 
to come to the table; she misbehaved, and her mother 
made her stand in the corner with her face to the wall. 
Sir Edward, a well­trained grandfather, did not interfere 
with his grandchild’s training.
(C) He decorated the wall on both sides of that corner with 
paintings for his granddaughter’s delight. If she had to 
stand in the corner again, at least she would have 
something to look at.
