We all have a tendency to look at our own flaws with a 
magnifying glass. If you continually tell yourself that this or 
that part of you is not up to standard, how can you expect 
it to get any better? Focus on the things you like about 
yourself. You will see how much better it feels to praise 
yourself rather than put yourself down. With this good 
feeling, you can do more for yourself and others than you 
could ever do with the negative energy of self­criticism. 
Choose to see the good. The choice is yours alone.
① 자신의 결점보다는 좋은 점을 찾으라. 
② 결점을 지적받으면 고치려고 노력하라. 
③ 다른 사람이 하는 칭찬에 자만하지 말라.

⑤ 다른 사람의 비판을 자기 발전의 계기로 삼으라. 
19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
I went to a local hardware store and purchased my first 
barbeque. I didn’t consider the size of the box relative to 
the size of my tiny car. However I tried, it wouldn’t fit. 
Being new to the area, I didn’t have many people I could 
call to help. As the store clerk and I stood in front of the 
store scratching our heads, a man in a big pickup truck 
pulled up in front of us. He too was picking up a barbeque 
and without being prompted, offered to throw mine next to 
his in the back of his truck and follow me home. He 
wouldn’t even let me tip him. He just pulled up in my 
driveway, unloaded the box, waved, and quietly drove away. 
Mister, you made my week!
① worried → regretful ② frustrated → grateful
③ jealous → relieved ④ relaxed → nervous
⑤ excited → disappointed
[20 ~ 21] 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
20. Soil erosion is not new. What is new is the rate of 
erosion. New soil forms when the weathering of rock 
exceeds losses from erosion. Throughout most of the earth’s 
geological history, the result was a gradual, long­term 
buildup of soil that could support vegetation. The vegetation 
in turn reduced erosion and facilitated the accumulation of 
topsoil. At some recent point in history, this relationship 
was reversed — with soil losses from wind and water erosion 
exceeding new soil formation. The world now is losing soil 
at a rate of billions of tons per year, and this is reducing 
the earth’s productivity. In many countries, the loss of soil 
is decreasing the productivity of the land. [3점]
① excessive soil erosion and its negative effect
② increased natural rate of topsoil accumulation
③ roles of water in enhancing soil productivity
④ ways to enhance the economic value of soil
21. Researcher Jack Greenberg studied how employees from 
various career sectors perceived their performance 
evaluation. He found that, regardless of the industry, it was 
incredibly important for employees to feel that they were 
active participants in the evaluation process. The employees 
were more likely to feel that the process was fair when 
supervisors requested their input prior to an evaluation and 
used it during the process, when there was two­way 
communication during the evaluation interviews, and when 
the employees had the chance to challenge the evaluation. In 
other words, if the employees were involved in their 
evaluation, they felt it was fairer.
① employees’ key roles in the company’s future growth
② effective strategies for selecting competent employees
③ evaluation as a means to enhance employees’ performance
④ importance of involving employees in the evaluation 
process
⑤ obstacles to the communication between supervisors and 
employees

22. The body is like a symphony where thousands of 
metabolic actions are orchestrated into harmony through the 
constant fine­tuning of conscious (e.g. exercise) and 
subconscious (e.g. digestion) instructions. When the harmony 
is broken, the body sends us information, signals and 
symptoms, in very direct and obvious ways. It is necessary 
that we pay attention to these signals instead of viewing 
them as burdens in our life. If we ignore or suppress health 
symptoms, they will become progressively louder and more 
extreme as the body attempts to capture our attention. 
When the oil light comes on in our car, do we disconnect 
the light, or do we take the car in for service? We usually 
take our car to the shop at the first sign of trouble. 
However, when it comes to our health, how many of us wait 
until the situation becomes serious before taking action?
* metabolic: 신진대사의 
①　Less Driving, Better Health
② Don’t Put Burdens on Your Mind
③　Listen to the Signals from Your Body
④　The Human Body: Art in Performance
⑤　The Body: The Mirror of the Personality
23. A woman in one of my seminars found that by going to 
bed early she could get up at four o’clock in the morning. 
She could then do the equivalent of a full day’s work by 
seven or eight o’clock, before the average person even got 
started. In no time at all, she was producing and earning 
double the amount of her co­workers. She was continually 
promoted and paid more money because she was getting far 
more done than anyone else. Successful people make a habit 
of getting up early, usually by 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning, 
sometimes earlier, and then getting going immediately. This 
gives them a great jump on the day. The average person, on 
the other hand, takes a full hour to get up and get going in 
the morning. Then they drag themselves off to work, 
thinking about lunchtime, and what they are going to do in 
the evening.
① Put People Before Money!
② Rise Early, Be More Productive!
③ Good Health Comes from Sound Sleep
④ Failure: A Stepping Stone to Success
⑤ Slow Down and Enjoy Life
24. Derek Parra에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
In 1995, Derek Parra was the best inline skater in the 
world, with eighteen world titles to his credit and a 
projection of many more to come. He was the king of his 
domain. However, there was a problem. Inline skating isn’t 
included in the Olympics and Parra dreamed of winning an 
Olympic gold medal. So, at the age of twenty­five, he 
switched to the sport of speedskating, a cousin of inline 
skating but with two important differences: you race on 
skates instead of wheels and on ice instead of asphalt. 
There was nothing easy about the switch. Parra had grown 
up in southern California and had hardly ever seen any ice, 
let alone spent any time on it. Overnight, he went from 
being No. 1 in the world to just somebody in the back of 
the pack. However, he stuck to his goals and persisted in 
making the transition, and in the 2002 Winter Olympic 
Games in Salt Lake City, he won his Olympic gold medal.
① 1995년에 세계 최고의 인라인스케이트 선수였다.
② 올림픽에서 금메달 따기를 꿈꾸었다.
③ 남부 California에서 성장했다.
④ 종목을 바꾼 직후에 세계 정상의 선수가 되었다.
⑤ 2002년 동계 올림픽에서 금메달을 땄다.

UK / US Students Wanting to Study Overseas
― Main Non-Academic Motives (2012)
The graph above shows the main non­academic motives 
identified by UK and US students wanting to study overseas 
in 2012. ①The number one motive for students from both 
countries was to have a unique adventure. ② To travel 
overseas was the second biggest motive for US students. ③
The percentage of UK students interested in starting an 
international career was seventeen percentage points higher 
than that of US students with the same motive. ④ To improve 
employment prospects was the second biggest motive for UK 
students, but the least attractive to US students. ⑤The 
percentage of US students who wanted to build self­confidence 
was exactly the same as that of UK students who wanted to 
become self­sufficient.

Coming home from work the other day, I saw a woman 
trying to turn onto the main street and ① having very little 
luck because of the constant stream of traffic. I slowed and 
allowed her to turn in front of me. I was feeling pretty good 
until, a couple of blocks later, she stopped to let a few more 
cars into the line, causing us both to miss the next light. I 
found myself completely ② irritated with her. How dare she 
slow me down after I had so graciously let her into the 
traffic! As I was sitting there stewing, I realized ③ how 
ridiculous I was being. Suddenly, a phrase I once read ④ came 
floating into my mind: ‘You must do him or her a kindness for 
inner reasons, not because someone is keeping score or 
because you will be punished if you don’t.’ I realized ⑤what I 
had wanted a reward: If I do this nice thing for you, you (or 
someone else) will do an equally nice thing for me.

Igor Cerc went to a store to have a clock engraved. It 
was a gift he was taking to a wedding the day he was 
picking it up. However,　when he arrived at the store, ① he 
found that the technician had broken the glass of the clock 
during the engraving process. They offered to replace the 
entire clock, after they got money from their insurance 
company, but Igor needed the clock now. He realized that it 
would not serve ② his goals to get upset. He calmly said 
that he needed to　 go to a wedding in thirty minutes; the 
clock was ③ his wedding gift. He noted that there was 
similar glass in other clocks in the store. Couldn’t the store 
take apart another clock to fix his? He was calm and polite 
throughout. “The clerk thanked me for not yelling at ④ him 
as other customers do,” said Igor. “I realized that he would 
do everything he could for me as long as I remained polite.” 
The clerk took apart another clock and quickly replaced the 
glass, and Igor went on ⑤ his way.

It is often believed that an active person can make friends 
more easily than a shy person, and that a conscientious 
person may meet more deadlines than a person who is not 
conscientious. Walter Mischel found, however, that the 
typical correlation between personality traits and behavior 
was quite (A) apparent / modest . This news was really 
shocking, because it essentially said that the traits 
personality psychologists were measuring were just slightly 
better at predicting behavior than astrological signs. Mischel 
did not simply point out the problem; he diagnosed the 
reasons for it. He argued that personality psychologists had 
(B) overestimated / underestimated  the extent to which the 
social situation shapes people’s behavior, independently of 
their personality. To predict whether a person will meet a 
deadline, for example, knowing something about the situation 
may be more useful than knowing the person’s score on a 
measure of conscientiousness. Situational influences can be 
very powerful, sometimes (C) emphasizing / overwhelming
individual differences in personality.
* conscientious: 성실한 ** astrological sign: 점성술의 별자리

31. When the navigation app on your smartphone is telling you 
the best route to the airport based on current traffic 
patterns, how does it know where the traffic is? Navigation 
systems are tracking your cell phone and the cell phones of 
thousands of other users of the applications to see how 
quickly those cell phones move through traffic. If you’re 
stuck in a traffic jam, your cell phone reports the same GPS 
coordinates for several minutes; if traffic is moving swiftly, 
your cell phone moves as quickly as your car and these 
apps can recommend routes based on that. The quality of 
the overall system depends crucially on there being a large 
number of users. In this respect they’re similar to 
telephones, fax machines, and e­mail: If only one or two 
people have them, they are not much good ― their utility 
increases with _____________.
* coordinate: 좌표
① inventors’ ideas
② the number of users
③ the design of devices 
④ the cost of production
⑤ geographical conditions
32. When scientists describe tool use by human beings, it is 
usually in terms of mechanical tools. This may apply to 
tools such as a sharpened flint blade or an electric drill. The 
key point is that the tool is thought of as passive and with 
a small number of predetermined uses. The digital revolution 
has begun to change this landscape in a significant way. 
Tools are now being developed with a general function in 
mind, but they are not predetermined in their operations. As 
a result, ___________________. For example, the personal 
computer is designed for the general function of handling 
and processing information, but exactly how the PC is used 
is not predetermined. Therefore, for some, it may offer a 
means of communication; for others, a sophisticated means 
of managing accounts; and for yet others, an entertainment 
platform. [3점]
* flint: 부싯돌
① you should find the merits of old inventions
② it is not possible to predict the outcome of their use
③ individual digital devices have grown smaller and cheaper
④ you should follow ethical rules when designing tools
⑤ they are not associated with mutual communication
33. The human brain cannot completely comprehend or 
appreciate all that it encounters in its lifespan. Even if a 
music lover kept his headphones on for every minute of 
every day for an entire year, he wouldn’t be able to listen 
to more than an eighth of all the albums that are released 
just in the United States in one year. Because we do not 
possess the capacity to give equal time to every artistic 
product that might come our way, we must rely on 
shortcuts. We may look for reviews and ratings of the latest 
movies before we decide which ones we’d like to see. We 
often let personal relationships guide our decisions about 
what art we allow into our lives. Also, we continually rely 
on the distribution systems through which we experience art
― museums, galleries, radio stations, television networks, 
etc. ― to narrow the field of possibilities for us so that we 
don’t have to ___________________________. [3점]
① spend all of our energy searching for the next great thing
② know how to turn our artistic talents into profits
③ create artistic products to learn about art
④ satisfy our deeply rooted hunger for art
⑤ avoid buying musical instruments online

In an astonishing example of how nurturing can influence 
nature, there is considerable evidence confirming that how 
parents emotionally respond to their children can encourage 
or suppress genetic tendencies. Biology is not destiny, so 
gene expression is not necessarily inevitable. To produce 
their effects, genes must be turned on. (A) , shyness 
is a trait that seems to be partially hereditary. If parents 
are overprotective of their shy young daughter, the toddler 
is likely to remain shy. However, if they encourage her to 
interact with other toddlers, she may overcome it. 
(B) , genetic tendencies toward intelligence, sociability, 
and aggression can be stimulated, controlled, or suppressed 
by parental response and other environmental influences.

② For example ······ However

Animals may have a limited understanding of what is 
happening now, but only humans seem to enrich their 
understanding of the present by thoughtful links to events in 
the distant past and future. Indeed, human goals often link 
what one does now to possible outcomes that lie years 
away. ① Thus, human action is not just a here­and­now 
response but is often designed to help bring about something 
far off, such as graduation or marriage or retirement. ② It 
can also be linked to things that have happened elsewhere 
or long ago, such as when people celebrate Independence 
Day or a religious holiday. ③ Moreover, people often follow 
the rules made in distant places by people they will never 
meet. ④ Different societies make different rules, so it’s hard 
to say which rules are more natural than others. ⑤ Most 
Americans pay income tax, for example, though few have 
any direct contact with the people who make the tax laws.

Sir Edward C. Burne­Jones was a prominent 
nineteenth­century English artist. One day he was invited 
to dinner at the home of his daughter.
(A) The next morning, he arrived at his daughter’s home 
with paints and palette. He went to the wall where the 
little girl had been forced to stand, and there he painted 
pictures ― a kitten chasing its tail, lambs in a field, and 
goldfish swimming.
(B) As a special treat, his young granddaughter was allowed 
to come to the table; she misbehaved, and her mother 
made her stand in the corner with her face to the wall. 
Sir Edward, a well­trained grandfather, did not interfere 
with his grandchild’s training.
(C) He decorated the wall on both sides of that corner with 
paintings for his granddaughter’s delight. If she had to 
stand in the corner again, at least she would have 
something to look at.

Mass customization is a strategy that allows 
manufacturers or retailers to provide individualized 
products to consumers. Today’s apparel supplier must 
look for new ways to offer customers top­quality goods 
at highly competitive prices.
(A) The customer then receives the finished product in a 
very short time. This technological strategy is used 
today by some fashion firms. This type of customization 
is often limited, however, to a small number of 
customers.
(B) Based on the exact image, body scanning software then 
defines and captures all the measurements necessary for 
actually producing the garment or shoe. This data is 
forwarded online to the manufacturer, whose production 
technologies ensure an exact fit.
(C) Consumers desire products that can be personalized 
through fit preferences, color selection, fabric choices, 
or design characteristics. A solution to the fit 
preference is a body or foot scanner that takes a 
customer’s measurements digitally, creating what is 
referred to as digital twin. [3점]

For example, if you say “I’m going to the bank to deposit 
some money,” I don’t expect you to go to the river bank.
Often, a word is used with more than one meaning. Indeed, 
a brief look at a dictionary will show you that the majority of 
words are used with more than one meaning. ( ① ) If such 
words were said to be ambiguous, then the vast majority of 
words would be ambiguous. ( ② ) However, linguists and 
philosophers usually call a word “ambiguous” only when there 
is some uncertainty about which meaning is being used in the 
particular instance. ( ③ ) A word isn’t ambiguous by itself but 
is used ambiguously: it is ambiguous when one cannot tell from 
the context what sense is being used. ( ④ ) However, in most 
cases one can tell from the context what sense is being 
used. ( ⑤ ) The word “bank” has these two senses (and more), 
but it is not thereby ambiguous: the two senses are so 
unrelated that no one is likely to confuse them.

Reading has also always had a social dimension, however, 
as it does in our early lives: our first acts of reading are 
performed with parents and teachers standing by and 
guiding us.
When we read, we are alone. Reading calls us to our sole 
self, and away from the world of distractions; but it also 
furnishes us with far­reaching connections to other people. 
( ① ) The peaceful calm of a desert island is not a bad 
image to have in your head as you prepare to read. ( ② ) 
No earthly storms can reach you here; you are safe. ( ③ ) 
The desert island image reinforces the idea that reading is a 
fundamentally solitary experience. ( ④ ) These mentors left 
their stamp on how we approach a text; they gave us the 
tools we use to get closer to the words on the page. ( ⑤ ) 
There is, of course, another social connection in reading: we 
always converse, by implication, with the book’s author.

The main reason you’re drawn to novel or surprising 
things is that it could upset the safe, predictable status 
quo and even threaten your survival. If you’ve ever tried 
to carry on a conversation in a room in which a TV is 
playing, you know that it’s hard not to glance at the 
screen occasionally. Even if you don’t want to watch, 
your brain is attracted by that constantly shifting stream 
of images, because change can have life­or­death 
consequences. Indeed, if our early African ancestors 
hadn’t been good at fixing all their attention on the 
just­ripened fruit or the approaching predators, we 
wouldn’t be here. For the same reason, a strong 
sensitivity to the odd detail that doesn’t quite correspond 
with the way things usually are or ought to be is a 
major asset for a soldier in a war zone. Even in 
everyday situations, you can’t afford to miss that 
jaywalker darting in front of your car or the single new 
and important fact in a long, boring list.

Blood pressure has to rise when we get out of bed in 
the morning, so that there is enough blood flow to the 
brain to keep us from fainting. When we sit down to 
read the morning newspaper, it goes down again. There 
is not a single, ideal level of blood pressure that our 
body tries to maintain. At the same time, it is obviously 
not to our benefit for blood pressure to get too low or 
too high, and there are mechanisms in place to keep it 
within a limited range.
I believe that a similar process occurs with human 
emotions. It is to people’s advantage to react emotionally 
to their environments, such that emotions vary from 
moment to moment. It is also to people’s advantage to 
have mechanisms in place to keep them away from the 
emotional extremes.
Think, for example, about the last time you 
experienced a state of happiness. Maybe it was the day 
you were married, or the day your child was born. You 
probably experienced a wave of pleasure rushing through 
your body. Your heart was beating rapidly, your blood 
pressure went up, and you were short of breath. Now 
imagine what it would be like to feel this way for an 
hour, a day, or a week. Sounds exhausting, doesn’t it?  
positive (or negative) emotions might have 
psychological costs, making it difficult to concentrate and 
to notice new emotional information.

(A)
Justin wished that his dad had a different job. It 
sounded so cool to say, “My dad is at the office!” 
However, Justin’s dad sold plastic souvenirs to tourists 
from a street stall. When other kids asked him, “What 
does your dad do for a living?” he always said, “(a) He 
is in business.” Then he would quickly change the 
subject before anyone could ask details about the kind of 
business in which his dad was involved.
(B)
His dad smiled. “Ever since your sixth birthday, I’ve 
put Saturdays’ earnings into a savings account for you. 
Now you can study at a college of your choice.” Justin 
felt a lump in his throat. “Thanks, Dad! I’ll work hard,” 
he promised. “I’ll get a degree and a good job and then 
(b) you won’t have to stand on windy street corners to 
sell your stuff any longer.” His dad gave him a warm 
hug.
(C)
He was also upset that his dad had to work on 
Saturdays. (c) He was never free to watch Justin play in 
soccer matches. The other dads would stand on the 
sidelines, cheering their sons, but his dad only said, 
“Enjoy the game, Justin! I wish I could be there to see 
you score the winning goal!” In the final match of the 
final season, when he had been voted man of the match, 
his dad wasn’t there to see it.
(D)
Justin dreamed of going to college one day, but (d) he 
thought it was an impossible goal. Yet he prayed about it 
regularly. On his seventeenth birthday, his dad handed 
him a big envelope. ‘What could be inside?’ he wondered. 
He hoped for money to buy new sneakers. But inside the 
envelope was a file of documents. “What’s this?” he 
asked. “Those are application forms for college,” his dad 
answered. “You can look through them and tell (e) me 
which course you want to take.” “But where will the 
money come from?” Justin asked, surprised.
