The main reason you’re drawn to novel or surprising 
things is that it could upset the safe, predictable status 
quo and even threaten your survival. If you’ve ever tried 
to carry on a conversation in a room in which a TV is 
playing, you know that it’s hard not to glance at the 
screen occasionally. Even if you don’t want to watch, 
your brain is attracted by that constantly shifting stream 
of images, because change can have life­or­death 
consequences. Indeed, if our early African ancestors 
hadn’t been good at fixing all their attention on the 
just­ripened fruit or the approaching predators, we 
wouldn’t be here. For the same reason, a strong 
sensitivity to the odd detail that doesn’t quite correspond 
with the way things usually are or ought to be is a 
major asset for a soldier in a war zone. Even in 
everyday situations, you can’t afford to miss that 
jaywalker darting in front of your car or the single new 
and important fact in a long, boring list.
* status quo: 현재의 상황 ** jaywalker: 무단 횡단자
