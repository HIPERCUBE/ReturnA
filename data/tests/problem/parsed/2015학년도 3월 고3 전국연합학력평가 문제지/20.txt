20. Soil erosion is not new. What is new is the rate of 
erosion. New soil forms when the weathering of rock 
exceeds losses from erosion. Throughout most of the earth’s 
geological history, the result was a gradual, long­term 
buildup of soil that could support vegetation. The vegetation 
in turn reduced erosion and facilitated the accumulation of 
topsoil. At some recent point in history, this relationship 
was reversed — with soil losses from wind and water erosion 
exceeding new soil formation. The world now is losing soil 
at a rate of billions of tons per year, and this is reducing 
the earth’s productivity. In many countries, the loss of soil 
is decreasing the productivity of the land. [3점]
