31. When the navigation app on your smartphone is telling you 
the best route to the airport based on current traffic 
patterns, how does it know where the traffic is? Navigation 
systems are tracking your cell phone and the cell phones of 
thousands of other users of the applications to see how 
quickly those cell phones move through traffic. If you’re 
stuck in a traffic jam, your cell phone reports the same GPS 
coordinates for several minutes; if traffic is moving swiftly, 
your cell phone moves as quickly as your car and these 
apps can recommend routes based on that. The quality of 
the overall system depends crucially on there being a large 
number of users. In this respect they’re similar to 
telephones, fax machines, and e­mail: If only one or two 
people have them, they are not much good ― their utility 
increases with _____________.
