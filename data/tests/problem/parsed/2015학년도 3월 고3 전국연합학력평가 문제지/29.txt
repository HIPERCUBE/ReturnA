Igor Cerc went to a store to have a clock engraved. It 
was a gift he was taking to a wedding the day he was 
picking it up. However,　when he arrived at the store, ① he 
found that the technician had broken the glass of the clock 
during the engraving process. They offered to replace the 
entire clock, after they got money from their insurance 
company, but Igor needed the clock now. He realized that it 
would not serve ② his goals to get upset. He calmly said 
that he needed to　 go to a wedding in thirty minutes; the 
clock was ③ his wedding gift. He noted that there was 
similar glass in other clocks in the store. Couldn’t the store 
take apart another clock to fix his? He was calm and polite 
throughout. “The clerk thanked me for not yelling at ④ him 
as other customers do,” said Igor. “I realized that he would 
do everything he could for me as long as I remained polite.” 
The clerk took apart another clock and quickly replaced the 
glass, and Igor went on ⑤ his way.
