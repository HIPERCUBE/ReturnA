I am Nick Kane, a local county 15­year business owner. 
During my wife Ilene’s marathon training, I have become 
aware of how many perfectly good pairs of shoes she goes 
through. The shoes become, very quickly, beyond race 
condition but are in perfect condition for everyday use. So I 
have arranged to place “drop boxes” throughout the area, 
collecting approximately 100 pairs of shoes a month. As of 
now, I have made arrangements to donate all gently worn 
shoes to shelters and organizations in need. For better 
public access, I am writing to request permission to place 
the box by the main entrance of your building. It would be 
a service for the community and our environment. Once 
more, I request your cooperation in full spirit.
