(A)
A college girl was waiting at an airport one night, with 
several long hours before her flight. (a) She bought a book 
and a bag of cookies in the airport shops, and found a 
place to relax. She was so into her book but happened to 
see that an elderly woman sitting beside her grabbed a 
cookie from the bag between them. She tried to ignore it 
to avoid a scene.
(B)
She boarded the plane, sank into her seat, and then 
sought her book, which was almost complete. As she 
reached in her baggage, she was surprised. There was her 
bag of cookies, in front of her eyes. She moaned in 
despair, “If my cookies are here, the others were hers! 
She tried to share!” Too late to apologize, she realized 
with grief, that (b) she was the rude one, the real thief.
(C)
(c) She munched the cookies and watched the clock, as 
the greedy cookie thief diminished her stock. She was 
getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by, thinking, 
“If I weren’t so nice, I would embarrass this shameful 
woman!” With each cookie the girl took, the old lady took 
one too. When only one was left, the girl wondered what 
this thief would do. With a smile on her face, and a 
nervous laugh, (d) she took the last cookie and broke it in 
half. She offered the girl half, as she ate the other.
(D)
The girl snatched it from her and thought, “This old 
woman is so rude. She didn’t even show any gratitude!” 
The girl had never known when she had been so taken 
advantage of. (e) She sighed with relief when her flight 
was called. She gathered her belongings and headed to the 
gate, refusing to look back at the thief.
