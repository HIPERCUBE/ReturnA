(A)
A college girl was waiting at an airport one night, with 
several long hours before her flight. (a) She bought a book 
and a bag of cookies in the airport shops, and found a 
place to relax. She was so into her book but happened to 
see that an elderly woman sitting beside her grabbed a 
cookie from the bag between them. She tried to ignore it 
to avoid a scene.
