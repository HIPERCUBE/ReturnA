34. The relationship between physical products and individual 
ownership is undergoing a profound evolution. We don’t 
want the CD; we want the music it plays. We don’t want 
the disc; we want the storage it holds. We don’t want the 
answering machine; we want the messages it saves. We 
don’t want the DVD; we want the movie it carries. In other 
words, we want not the stuff but the needs or experiences 
it fulfills. As our possessions “dematerialize” into the 
intangible, our preconceptions of ownership are changing, 
creating a dotted line between “what’s mine,” “what’s 
yours,” and “what’s ours.” This shift is fueling a world 
where                 has more value than possession, and  
as Kevin Kelly, a founder of Wired magazine, puts it, where  
“access is better than ownership.” [3점]
