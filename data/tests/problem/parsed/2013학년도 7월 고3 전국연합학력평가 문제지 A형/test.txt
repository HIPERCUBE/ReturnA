One of the key fears we all have is fear that this is the 
wrong time to start whatever our project is, and we should 
wait until the “time is right.” Tim Ferriss, author of the 
bestselling book The 4­Hour Workweek, has this to say 
about timing: “For all the most important things, the timing 
is always wrong. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? 
The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will 
never all be green at the same time. Conditions are never 
perfect. ‘Someday’ is a disease that will take your dreams 
to the grave with you. If it’s important to you and you want 
to do it ‘eventually,’ just do it and correct course along the 
way.” If you wait for the timing to be right before you 
make a move, you may never make a move at all. 
① 과거의 실패에 얽매이지 마라.
② 성공을 위해 일의 우선순위를 정하라.
③ 결과보다는 노력의 과정에 의미를 부여하라. 
④ 꿈을 실현하기 위한 구체적인 계획을 세워라.
⑤ 원하는 일은 때를 기다리지 말고 바로 실행하라.

I am Nick Kane, a local county 15­year business owner. 
During my wife Ilene’s marathon training, I have become 
aware of how many perfectly good pairs of shoes she goes 
through. The shoes become, very quickly, beyond race 
condition but are in perfect condition for everyday use. So I 
have arranged to place “drop boxes” throughout the area, 
collecting approximately 100 pairs of shoes a month. As of 
now, I have made arrangements to donate all gently worn 
shoes to shelters and organizations in need. For better 
public access, I am writing to request permission to place 
the box by the main entrance of your building. It would be 
a service for the community and our environment. Once 
more, I request your cooperation in full spirit.

Your first day of work is a whirlwind of introductions and 
meetings. You will meet many different people, receive a 
phonebook­sized pack of information about your healthcare 
plan and be walked through the “simple” 30­step process for 
clearing a paper jam in the copy machine. This is exactly 
the right time to take notes; you will thank yourself later. 
If you are an expert with your handheld, write down notes 
electronically. Otherwise, invest in a small notebook that 
you can stick in your pocket and pull out when your boss 
starts explaining something important. Names and positions 
are probably the most important notes to take; people like 
to think they are memorable enough for you to remember 
their names.               * handheld: 손에 쥘 만한 크기의 컴퓨터

With seven billion mouths to feed, human agriculture 
takes a tremendous toll on the planet, from energy use to 
habitat loss. But there is also a growing set of solutions, 
from organic agriculture to integrated pest control. More 
people around the world are taking a look at urban farming, 
which allows us to make our food as “local” as possible. By 
growing what we need near where we live, we decrease the 
“foodmiles” associated with long­distance transportation. 
Also, urban agriculture can add greenery to cities, reducing 
pollution, increasing shade, and preventing the unpleasant 
heat island effect. Garden plots can help people reconnect 
with the Earth, and gain a greater appreciation for where 
our food comes from. Rooftop and patio gardens create 
peaceful places for relaxation and they can attract tourists.

The decline in manufacturing will inevitably bring about a 
new protectionism. The first reaction to a period of 
turbulence is to try to build a wall that ① shields one’s own 
garden from the cold winds outside. But such walls no 
longer protect businesses that do not meet world standards. 
It will only make them more ② prosperous. The best 
example is Mexico, which had a deliberate policy of building 
its domestic economy ③ independent of the outside world. It 
did this not only by building high walls of protectionism to 
keep foreign competition out, but by practically forbidding its 
own companies to export. This attempt to create a purely 
Mexican economy ④ failed. Mexico actually became 
increasingly dependent on imports from other countries. It 
was finally ⑤ obliged to open itself to the outside world.

I had never been on a roller coaster. Today, I was faced 
with one. There was some kind of bar, which was raised in 
front of me and was brought back into my lap. My heart 
started to pound. Trying to put myself at ease, I held 
tightly onto the bar in my lap. The cars jumped a bit and 
we began moving along the track. Now, I could even hear 
heartbeats, louder than the “clickity­click” sound coming 
from under the cars. We moved from a horizontal position 
to a steep incline and the roller coaster began ascending to 
the top of that first hill. My heart pounded wildly! I could 
not look out over the side of the car. Even before the 
coaster began to fall down, I was in a total panic. 3

34. The relationship between physical products and individual 
ownership is undergoing a profound evolution. We don’t 
want the CD; we want the music it plays. We don’t want 
the disc; we want the storage it holds. We don’t want the 
answering machine; we want the messages it saves. We 
don’t want the DVD; we want the movie it carries. In other 
words, we want not the stuff but the needs or experiences 
it fulfills. As our possessions “dematerialize” into the 
intangible, our preconceptions of ownership are changing, 
creating a dotted line between “what’s mine,” “what’s 
yours,” and “what’s ours.” This shift is fueling a world 
where                 has more value than possession, and  
as Kevin Kelly, a founder of Wired magazine, puts it, where  
“access is better than ownership.” [3점]

easier when their scent is intense. According to a recent 
study in the journal Flavour, when we experience a strong 
complementary aroma with our food, we take smaller bites. 
The scent of coffee in a mocha dessert can be a good 
example. It is thought that there is some sort of feedback 
loop happening in our brains: a strong complementary smell 
makes us                          　　　. Next time you 
serve a sweet treat at a dinner party, think about lighting a 
vanilla­scented candle. The scent of the candle may help 
your friends not overeat. Or when you order a dessert at a 
restaurant, pair it with strong­smelling coffee. You can find 
its flavor goes into effect. 
① regain our appetite
② reduce our food intake
③ relax the mind and body
④ fall into a romantic mood
⑤ distinguish between different scents
6. Scientists and educators have long sought to understand 
the emergence of expertise, artistic and otherwise. Many 
researchers have argued that exceptional achievement can 
simply come down to                  . Studies of eminent 
scientists in the 1950s supported this view by underscoring 
the individuals’ capacity for endurance, concentration and 
commitment to effortful practice. Benjamin Bloom, an 
education psychologist, wrote in 1985 that none of his 
subjects achieved expertise without a supportive environment 
and a long and intensive period of training. This education 
came first from encouraging instructors and later from 
demanding master teachers. A few years later psychologist 
K. Anders Ericsson of Florida State University conducted 
studies of experts in piano, violin, chess, or athletics. The 
investigations revealed that a person’s level of achievement 
correlated strongly with the amount of practice put in. [3점]

  Dogs’ ability to learn about humans is amazing. They 
respond to our gestures, attend to our body language, and 
follow our gaze to figure out what we are looking at. They 
are even known to repeat human yawns. As the 
longest­domesticated species, dogs have evolved alongside 
humans, selected over thousands of years for traits that  
make them especially sensitive to our cues.      (A)      , 
it is found that puppies only a few weeks old could 
interpret human signals, while full­grown wolves raised by 
humans could not. Dogs read people better than 
chimpanzees, humans’ closest primate relative, according to 
the research published this year.      (B)     , the most 
accurate comparison is to a human child: dogs have the 
social cognition capacities of a 2­year­old.

At Harvard many students are so impatient to shine that 
they try to peak before their full growth, not having time 
to ponder deeply. ① Being aware of this, the dean, Harry 　
R. Lewis, asks freshmen to slow down and get more out of 
college by doing less. ② Dean Lewis does not want to  
discourage achievement, yet he insists that students are 
more likely to sustain the effort required if they allow time 
for leisure and solitude. ③ He cautions students not to pack 
their schedule with so many activities that they have no 
time to think about why they are doing what they are 
doing. ④ He asserts that the more work students do at one

Often, however, someone has an inherent or acquired 
trait that is foreign to his or her parents and must 
therefore acquire identity from a peer group, which 
is called a horizontal identity.

Because of the transmission of identity from one 
generation to the next, most children share at least 
some traits with their parents. These are vertical 
identities. ( ① ) Attributes and values are passed down 
from parents to child across the generations not only 
through strands of DNA, but also through shared cultural 
norms. ( ② ) Language, for example, is usually vertical, 
since most people who speak Greek raise their children to 
speak Greek, too. ( ③ ) Such identities may reflect 
recessive genes, or values and preferences that a child does 
not share with his ancestors. ( ④ ) Criminal behavior is 
often horizontal; most criminals are not raised by 
gangsters and must invent their own deceptive character. 
( ⑤ ) So are conditions such as autism and intellectual 
disability.                                    * autism: 자폐증

chunks.
(A)　After that, pour the soap into the mold and allow it to 
completely harden. Now you have your own special 
soap!
(B)　Next, put them in a heat­resistant glass bowl. Put this

Illustrations in picture books invite children to read and 
interact with text. They motivate young readers to find 
hidden objects or to predict what is going to happen next. 
Young children love to play hide­’n­seek and look for hidden 
objects in pictures. Picture books can serve as an effective 
tool to promote children’s                . By reading picture 
books without too much text, children learn to use their 
active imagination to interpret and create mental 
representations of the story. Children often associate 
pictures with their life experiences or familiar images, and 
construct meaning based on their background knowledge. 
Children often come up with unique and creative 
interpretations of the plot, settings, and characters when 
they read picture books. For example, the child reader and 
the adult reader may like David Wiesner’s Tuesday for 
different reasons. In this book, Wiesner uses very limited 
words to provide readers with a time frame. Other than that, 
the reader has to use their own imagination and judgment to 
predict and interpret what is going on in the story. For 
example, the book has a picture of pigs floating in the air 
without any accompanying text. Here the reader is invited 
to use their own imagination to predict the future   
adventures of the pigs. This encourages the child reader to 
create their own stories based on their imagination.

(A)
A college girl was waiting at an airport one night, with 
several long hours before her flight. (a) She bought a book 
and a bag of cookies in the airport shops, and found a 
place to relax. She was so into her book but happened to 
see that an elderly woman sitting beside her grabbed a 
cookie from the bag between them. She tried to ignore it 
to avoid a scene.
  She boarded the plane, sank into her seat, and then 
sought her book, which was almost complete. As she 
reached in her baggage, she was surprised. There was her 
bag of cookies, in front of her eyes. She moaned in 
despair, “If my cookies are here, the others were hers! 
She tried to share!” Too late to apologize, she realized 
with grief, that (b) she was the rude one, the real thief.
(C)
(c) She munched the cookies and watched the clock, as 
the greedy cookie thief diminished her stock. She was 
getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by, thinking, 
“If I weren’t so nice, I would embarrass this shameful 
woman!” With each cookie the girl took, the old lady took 
one too. When only one was left, the girl wondered what 
this thief would do. With a smile on her face, and a 
nervous laugh, (d) she took the last cookie and broke it in 
half. She offered the girl half, as she ate the other.
(D)
The girl snatched it from her and thought, “This old 
woman is so rude. She didn’t even show any gratitude!” 
The girl had never known when she had been so taken 
advantage of. (e) She sighed with relief when her flight 
was called. She gathered her belongings and headed to the 
gate, refusing to look back at the thief.
