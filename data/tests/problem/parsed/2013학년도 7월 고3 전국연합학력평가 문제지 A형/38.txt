they try to peak before their full growth, not having time 
to ponder deeply. ① Being aware of this, the dean, Harry 　
R. Lewis, asks freshmen to slow down and get more out of 
college by doing less. ② Dean Lewis does not want to  
discourage achievement, yet he insists that students are 
more likely to sustain the effort required if they allow time 
for leisure and solitude. ③ He cautions students not to pack 
their schedule with so many activities that they have no 
time to think about why they are doing what they are 
doing. ④ He asserts that the more work students do at one 
time, the more successful their school life will be. ⑤ Most 
precious is their freedom to choose, he insists, which they 
can maintain only by allowing for unstructured time and 
flexibility.
