34.  An option is forced if not choosing to decide is somehow 
equivalent in its consequences to choosing not to decide. I 
recently debated buying a particular car that had just arrived at 
a local dealership. I looked at it for two days and test-drove it 
twice. I really liked it. It was an extraordinary deal because of 
some rare circumstances. But, as much as I liked it, and as 
perfect a deal as it seemed, I couldn’t manage to form the 
positive belief that I should go buy it. The situation was such 
that this was equivalent to                                                   , 
as my hesitation allowed another interested party to snatch it 
away while I pondered the possibilities. If you are presented 
with a good job offer and given 48 hours to respond, then not 
choosing is equivalent in its consequences to a negative choice. 
It is a forced option. [3점]
