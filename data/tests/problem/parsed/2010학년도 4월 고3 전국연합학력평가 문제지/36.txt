Snow leopards are considered shy because they are rarely 
seen in the wild. They live high in the mountains of central 
Asia, where plants are scarce. Their fur, which is typically 
yellowish-gray with black rosette-shaped spots, camouflages 
them in rocky and snowy conditions. Snow leopards’ large furry 
paws act like snowshoes to help them walk on snow. Their 
large paws also allow them to grip rocks. Snow leopards 
primarily prey on mountain sheep, goats, rodents, birds and 
deer. They hunt by hiding behind rocks on slopes above prey 
animals, then leaping down and pouncing on the prey. Snow 
leopards have extremely long tails, which aid their balance. 
Their long tails are also useful for covering their faces to stay 
warm while they’re resting.
