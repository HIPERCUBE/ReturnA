32.  Increasingly, marketers are looking to blogs on the Internet 
to find opinion leaders. Especially, marketers are turning to 
teen blogs to identify the social trends that are shaping 
consumer behavior. Raised with a rapidly maturing Internet and 
expanding cell phone capabilities, teens have much access to 
the world around them. With their ability to network and 
communicate with each other, young people rely on each 
others’ opinions more than marketing messages when making 
purchase decisions. Blogs are becoming a key way that teens 
communicate their opinions. Consequently, today’s marketers 
are reading teen blogs, developing products that meet the very 
specific needs that teens express there.
