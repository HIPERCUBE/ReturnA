28.  Consumer advertising shows an unrealistic ideal of the female 
body shape. The vast majority of advertising uses female models 
whose key features such as thinness and pure skin  
. This can create false 
expectations on the part of women and their partners, as well as 
society at large. The portrayal of women in advertising is also 
highly stylized. It can significantly distort the connection 
viewers make between what they see in an advertisement and 
what women actually look like. Through its excessive focus on 
ideal body-type models, advertising also pressures women into 
conforming to a perfect body. This increases the likelihood of 
eating disorders, as well as the pursuit of unnecessary cosmetic 
surgery, anti-aging treatments, etc.
