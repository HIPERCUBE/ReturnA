43.  The sounds heard during sleep can sharpen your memory. A 
dozen subjects took a memory test in which they learned the 
positions of 50 objects on a computer screen. Each picture was 
paired with its own little sound effect. An image of a shattering 
wine glass was accompanied by the sound of breaking glass. 
Little sticks of dynamite? Boom sound, and so on. Once the 
subjects learned to put the pictures where they belonged, they 
were encouraged to sleep. While they slept, scientists played 
the sounds for half the images presented during the memory 
test. And when the subjects woke up and retook the test, they 
were better at placing the 25 objects of which sounds they heard 
during the sleep. Sounds you hear while sleeping help enhance 
your memory.
