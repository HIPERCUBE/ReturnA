Registered as a World Natural Heritage site in 1981, 
Patagonia’s fantastic blue glaciers are rapidly melting due to 
global warming. We are striving to make a difference through 
eco-friendly operations. For example, our recent technology 
for printers and copiers has reduced CO2 emissions over the 
past 8 years by around 8.4 million tons. More important, thanks 
to this technology’s success, the rate of CO2 decrease is now 
growing year by year. In our effort to conserve resources, we 
consider the environmental impact of our products by looking at 
every stage of the product life cycle. We reuse and recycle 
materials and work constantly to reduce energy use. The earth 
is precious. By focusing on eco-friendly effort, we can keep it 
from all just flowing away.
