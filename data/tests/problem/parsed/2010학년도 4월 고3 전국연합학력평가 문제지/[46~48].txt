(A)
Years ago there was a group of brilliant male students at the 
University of Wisconsin, who had amazing creative literary 
talent. These promising young men met regularly to analyze and 
criticize each other’s work. They were heartless, tough, even 
mean in their criticism. The sessions became such arenas of 
literary criticism that the members of this exclusive club called 
themselves the “Stranglers.” 
(B)
Twenty years later a graduate of the university was doing an 
exhaustive study of his classmates’ careers when he noticed a 
vast difference in the literary accomplishments of the 
Stranglers as opposed to the Wranglers. Of all the bright young 
men in the Stranglers, not one had made a significant literary 
accomplishment of any kind. From the Wranglers had come six 
or more successful writers. 
(C)
What caused the literary success of the Wranglers? Talent 
between the two? Probably the same. Level of education? Not 
much difference. But the Stranglers strangled, while the 
Wranglers gave each other a lift. The Stranglers promoted an 
atmosphere of argument and criticism. The Wranglers 
highlighted                                     . These are good examples 
of how to kill morale, as well as how to improve it.
(D)
Not to be outdone, the women of literary talent in the 
university were determined to start a club of their own, one 
comparable to the Stranglers. They called themselves the 
“Wranglers.” They, too, read their works to one another. But 
there was one great difference. The criticism was much softer, 
more positive, and more encouraging. Sometimes, there was 
almost no criticism at all. Every effort was encouraged.
