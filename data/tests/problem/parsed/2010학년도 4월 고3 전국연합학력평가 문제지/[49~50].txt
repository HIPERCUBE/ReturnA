Our happiness and our free self-expression is much more 
assured if we let go of end results; work toward our goals and 
not be imprisoned by them. We love the people who are least 
concerned about making an impression. They let go of any 
desperation for affection, so they automatically have the 
affection. People who make a lot of money, only start to make it 
when they stop working for it! In other words, they find 
something they love to do and the wealth flows in automatically. 
They have money because they let go of it. An outsider might 
say of someone who is financially successful, “The greedy pig. 
He is worth ten million dollars and he is still working!” The man 
is working because he loves the                 more than the 
money. That is why he is rich! In a sense we need to be able to 
live without something in order to have it. Once we can let go, 
we are in a position of great power. Successful businessmen 
know that the only way to pull off a successful deal is to 
release the deal ― to become emotionally unattached.
