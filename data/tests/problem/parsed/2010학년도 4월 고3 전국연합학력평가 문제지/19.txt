19. 밑줄 친 him이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
　 Keith had a problem returning money to others when they had 
loaned it to ① him. He was neither broke nor selfish. He was 
just forgetful. He had little awareness of the discomfort he 
caused those who lent ② him money. One afternoon a friend 
who had loaned ③ him money several months before dropped 
by his office. His friend said, “Several times I’ve asked you 
about the money. I don’t think you’re intentionally ignoring my 
requests. But your forgetfulness is hurting me, and it’s hurting 
our friendship.” Keith was astonished. He hadn’t had a clue that 
such a little thing to ④ him might mean so much to his close 
friend. Deeply regretful over the loss his friend had suffered, 
he returned the money to ⑤ him immediately.
