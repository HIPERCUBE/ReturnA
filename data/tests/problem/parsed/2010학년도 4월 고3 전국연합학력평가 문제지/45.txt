The Fair Trade movement grows out of a variety of North 
American and European organizations. Since the 1940s, they 
have sought to help disadvantaged groups by creating 
alternative trade networks. Some pioneer organizations began 
purchasing handicrafts from poor producers in the third world 
nations at above-market prices, selling them directly to 
consumers. During the 1960s and 1970s, these organizations 
and their direct sales networks expanded significantly. The 
organizations in Europe established thousands of popular 
handicraft stores known as “World Shop.” Smaller 
organizations in North America sold through catalogues and 
small shops. By the 1980s these diverse efforts had shaped 
the beginning of a common Fair Trade movement.
