The Fair Trade movement grows out of a variety of North 
American and European organizations. Since the 1940s, they 
have sought to help disadvantaged groups by creating 
alternative trade networks. Some pioneer organizations began 
purchasing handicrafts from poor producers in the third world 
nations at above-market prices, selling them directly to 
consumers. During the 1960s and 1970s, these organizations 
and their direct sales networks expanded significantly. The 
organizations in Europe established thousands of popular 
handicraft stores known as “World Shop.” Smaller 
organizations in North America sold through catalogues and 
small shops. By the 1980s these diverse efforts had shaped 
the beginning of a common Fair Trade movement.

(A)
Years ago there was a group of brilliant male students at the 
University of Wisconsin, who had amazing creative literary 
talent. These promising young men met regularly to analyze and 
criticize each other’s work. They were heartless, tough, even 
mean in their criticism. The sessions became such arenas of 
literary criticism that the members of this exclusive club called 
themselves the “Stranglers.” 
(B)
Twenty years later a graduate of the university was doing an 
exhaustive study of his classmates’ careers when he noticed a 
vast difference in the literary accomplishments of the 
Stranglers as opposed to the Wranglers. Of all the bright young 
men in the Stranglers, not one had made a significant literary 
accomplishment of any kind. From the Wranglers had come six 
or more successful writers. 
(C)
What caused the literary success of the Wranglers? Talent 
between the two? Probably the same. Level of education? Not 
much difference. But the Stranglers strangled, while the 
Wranglers gave each other a lift. The Stranglers promoted an 
atmosphere of argument and criticism. The Wranglers 
highlighted                                     . These are good examples 
of how to kill morale, as well as how to improve it.
(D)
Not to be outdone, the women of literary talent in the 
university were determined to start a club of their own, one 
comparable to the Stranglers. They called themselves the 
“Wranglers.” They, too, read their works to one another. But 
there was one great difference. The criticism was much softer, 
more positive, and more encouraging. Sometimes, there was 
almost no criticism at all. Every effort was encouraged.

Our happiness and our free self-expression is much more 
assured if we let go of end results; work toward our goals and 
not be imprisoned by them. We love the people who are least 
concerned about making an impression. They let go of any 
desperation for affection, so they automatically have the 
affection. People who make a lot of money, only start to make it 
when they stop working for it! In other words, they find 
something they love to do and the wealth flows in automatically. 
They have money because they let go of it. An outsider might 
say of someone who is financially successful, “The greedy pig. 
He is worth ten million dollars and he is still working!” The man 
is working because he loves the                 more than the 
money. That is why he is rich! In a sense we need to be able to 
live without something in order to have it. Once we can let go, 
we are in a position of great power. Successful businessmen 
know that the only way to pull off a successful deal is to 
release the deal ― to become emotionally unattached.
