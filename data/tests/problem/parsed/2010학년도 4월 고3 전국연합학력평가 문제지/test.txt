It’s not always easy to tell what’s it and what’s not. 
Sometimes, it’s accidental — you really intended to do your own 
work, but instead ended up with some sentences that sound just 
like something you’ve read. It is a shortcut that enables you to 
save time for thinking about any subject, gathering your own 
thoughts about it. Cut, paste, and you’re done. It comes from a 
Latin word for kidnapping. You know that kidnapping is stealing 
a person. You wouldn’t take someone’s lunch money or bike, 
right? Well, someone’s words and thoughts are personal 
property, too. Ask yourself, “Would I know this if I hadn’t read 
it on that website or in that book?” If the answer is no, list the 
original source.

19. 밑줄 친 him이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
　 Keith had a problem returning money to others when they had 
loaned it to ① him. He was neither broke nor selfish. He was 
just forgetful. He had little awareness of the discomfort he 
caused those who lent ② him money. One afternoon a friend 
who had loaned ③ him money several months before dropped 
by his office. His friend said, “Several times I’ve asked you 
about the money. I don’t think you’re intentionally ignoring my 
requests. But your forgetfulness is hurting me, and it’s hurting 
our friendship.” Keith was astonished. He hadn’t had a clue that 
such a little thing to ④ him might mean so much to his close 
friend. Deeply regretful over the loss his friend had suffered, 
he returned the money to ⑤ him immediately.

Registered as a World Natural Heritage site in 1981, 
Patagonia’s fantastic blue glaciers are rapidly melting due to 
global warming. We are striving to make a difference through 
eco-friendly operations. For example, our recent technology 
for printers and copiers has reduced CO2 emissions over the 
past 8 years by around 8.4 million tons. More important, thanks 
to this technology’s success, the rate of CO2 decrease is now 
growing year by year. In our effort to conserve resources, we 
consider the environmental impact of our products by looking at 
every stage of the product life cycle. We reuse and recycle 
materials and work constantly to reduce energy use. The earth 
is precious. By focusing on eco-friendly effort, we can keep it

21. (A)~(C)에서 어법에 맞는 표현을 바르게 짝지은 것은?
It is difficult to determine the shape of fire. There is a 
simplified design, (A) adopted / adopting for use in posters 
and signs. It resembles three upright tongues or a lotus 
flower. The design is a typical symbol of fire. However, the 
shape of fire is hard to define. In reality, fire comes in many 
forms (B) alike / like candle flame, charcoal fire, and torch 
light. The various nature of the shape of fire is evident in 
many words Koreans use to describe fire and its shape and 
movements. For instance, iggle-iggle is an adverb that 
describes a fire burning, but it focuses on the heat rather than 
the shape of the flame, (C) while / which hwal-hwal or 
hweol-hweol brings to mind flames that soar, as if to rise to 
the heavens.
(A) (B) (C)
① adopted …… like …… while
② adopted …… alike …… which
③ adopted …… like …… which
④ adopting …… like …… while
⑤ adopting …… alike …… which

Not long ago I heard about a man who ① found $35,000 in a 
bag on the street. He instantly sought out and returned ② it to 
the owner. Everyone who heard the story wanted to congratulate 
this man, but he shied away from the media and avoided being 
filmed. He firmly insisted that returning the money ③ was the 
right and only thing he could do. It turned out that this money 
was the life savings of an old woman, and through his one act he 
probably saved her financial life, yet he refused ④ to receive 
praise. Why? Clearly the experiences of his past had helped him 
to develop a belief: receiving praise for doing ⑤ that obviously 
was the right thing would be totally inappropriate.

Every adult should engage in half an hour of moderate physical 
activity at least five days per week to remain active and healthy, 
according to national health guidelines. ① However, about half 
the Australian population is not achieving this and, as a result, 
has increased the nation’s risk of cardiovascular diseases, 
diabetes and obesity. ② According to an Australian institute 
specializing in the heart and diabetes, regular physical exercise 
such as riding a bike may be an answer. ③ A director of the 
institute says bike riding is the sensible choice to improve health 
for those not normally accustomed to training. ④ Studies also 
show that safety has been improved for both motorists and 
cyclists when bike lanes exist. ⑤ Bike riding appeals to a large 
number of people because it is affordable and can be a stepping 
stone for fitness.

24.  One difference between winners and losers is their                
toward the problems. Achievers never see a 
problem as being overwhelming. That is, they don’t think one 
problem controls their whole life. They always see it as, “Well, 
it’s just a little challenge with my eating pattern.” They don’t 
see it as, “I’m the problem. Because I overeat, my whole life is 
destroyed.” Conversely, failures have developed a belief that 
because they ruined in one area, they lost everything! They 
believe that because they have financial challenges, their whole 
life is now destroyed: their kids won’t be taken care of, their 
spouses will leave them, and so on. Pretty soon they generalize 
that things are out of control and feel completely helpless. 
① dependence ② attitude ③ hatred
④ effort ⑤ aim
25.  The language barrier cannot be regarded as a defect though it 
may present problems to the conversationalists. To overcome 
this, the people conversing should be considerate towards one 
another. It is both improper and impolite for persons in a group 
to engage themselves in conversation with one another in any 
language not known to all present. However, situations 
sometimes arise when communication is difficult, as is the case 
when we have foreigners in our midst. We do not understand 
them nor they us. But if the will to communicate is strong 
enough, language will not be a(n)                               . We 
always have, as a standby, communication by sign language, 
though it cannot really be called conversation.
① necessary evil ② cultural tradition
③ impolite interaction ④ monitoring system
⑤ unconquerable obstacle
26.  Read the following two lines to yourself:
Did you read the first line as a set of letters? Did you read the 
second line as a set of numbers? Look closely now at the letter 
B and the number 13. The actual marks on the paper are the 
same. What accounts for the fact that most people read letters 
in the first line and numbers in the second? If you say it has 
something to do with                                                            , 
you are correct. What words or sentences mean has a lot to do 
with what goes before or after them. We often think that 
meaning comes from the marks on the page, but meaning also 
has a lot to do with what is in our heads. We see what we 
expect to see. 
① the conflicts between numbers
② the ability to read between the lines
③ the literacy level of writers and readers
④ the information around the written symbols
⑤ the writer’s statements about the dramatic effects
27.  There are times when having a pessimistic view is beneficial. 
For example, if you are driving in thick fog, it might be good to 
be focused on the fact that a car could be coming in the opposite 
direction! Many studies have found that pessimists were more 
accurate in their assessments than optimists. For example, in 
one test researchers asked the participants to predict how much 
they could control over a certain task that was given for the 
test. The result was that optimists thought they had a high 
degree of control over the task even when they had no control 
over it. However, pessimists accurately predicted how much or 
little control they had over the task. So in business it can be 
good to have some pessimists attached to your team, as they 
will often 　　　　　　　　　　　　     　　　　          　　　　　　　 than the optimists. 
①　possess better physical ability
②　appreciate career guidelines better
③　use various ways to achieve things
④　create a more pleasant atmosphere
⑤　have a stronger control over reality
28.  Consumer advertising shows an unrealistic ideal of the female 
body shape. The vast majority of advertising uses female models 
whose key features such as thinness and pure skin  
. This can create false 
expectations on the part of women and their partners, as well as 
society at large. The portrayal of women in advertising is also 
highly stylized. It can significantly distort the connection 
viewers make between what they see in an advertisement and 
what women actually look like. Through its excessive focus on 
ideal body-type models, advertising also pressures women into 
conforming to a perfect body. This increases the likelihood of 
eating disorders, as well as the pursuit of unnecessary cosmetic 
surgery, anti-aging treatments, etc.
① undermine their intellectual capacity
② highlight the internal beauty of women
③ do not correspond to many women’s bodies
④ are the improper response to market demand
⑤ encourage women to enjoy their circumstances

The carts that came could not pass through. They had to wait, 
the driver calling and shouting, till the dense crowd would make 
way. Everywhere, young fellows from the outlying districts 
were making conversation with the girls, standing in the road 
and at the corners. The doors of the public houses were open 
and full of light. Men passed in and out through the doors in a 
continual stream. Everywhere men were calling out to one 
another, crossing to meet one another, or standing in little 
groups and circles, discussing, endlessly discussing. The sense 
of talk, buzzing, the endless chatting and arguing vibrated in the 
air. 
① busy and noisy ② calm and peaceful
③ cozy and warm ④ urgent and funny
⑤ sad and tragic

Can you guess why the picture above is titled “How Can This 
B e     T  r u e  ? ”  Look at Figure 1. It is made up of four separable 
pieces. More specifically, it consists of two ① triangles and two 
polygons which look like the letter “L”. These L-like fragments 
are combined into a rectangle. The four parts have ② different 
sizes respectively. Especially, the triangle at the left side of the 
rectangle is ③ smaller than the one on the top of the rectangle. 
Now, look at Figure 2. You move and ④ rearrange the four 
fragments from Figure 1 without adding new pieces or pulling 
out the original ones. The result? Strange enough, there is a 
small ⑤ square hole at the bottom of the newly-born figure. 
How can this be true?

Some students are only interested in scoring marks. They 
cram up their lessons quickly and forget them faster. A student 
in the 12th grade forgets all he learned in the 11th grade. Some 
students and parents think studying only what is taught now is 
enough. For a bad student, the previous class is like a waste bin.  
(A)      , a better student treats it as his base, considering 
that earlier classes are the foundation for later classes. Some 
throw away old textbooks and notebooks because they do not 
want garbage in their house. This is an attitude students and 
parents have to change. You may occasionally have to refer to 
old books when there is a doubt.         (B)       , removing the 
old books kills even the habit of getting your doubts cleared.
(A) (B)
① However …… Therefore
② However …… Otherwise
③ Moreover …… Otherwise
④ Likewise …… Therefore
⑤ Likewise …… In contrast

32.  Increasingly, marketers are looking to blogs on the Internet 
to find opinion leaders. Especially, marketers are turning to 
teen blogs to identify the social trends that are shaping 
consumer behavior. Raised with a rapidly maturing Internet and 
expanding cell phone capabilities, teens have much access to 
the world around them. With their ability to network and 
communicate with each other, young people rely on each 
others’ opinions more than marketing messages when making 
purchase decisions. Blogs are becoming a key way that teens 
communicate their opinions. Consequently, today’s marketers 
are reading teen blogs, developing products that meet the very 
specific needs that teens express there.

33.  We are constantly bombarded with celebrities telling us 
which credit card to use, what coffee to drink, or which politician 
to support. Using celebrities’ opinions may not be logical. Often 
the “expert” or “authority” speaks out on a topic that is unrelated 
to his or her own field. Suppose the Minister of Health and 
Welfare warns that smoking is harmful and may cause cancer. 
Though he is not a doctor, his warning seemingly sounds 
perfect. The fact that he is Minister of Health and Welfare may 
qualify him as an expert in the health field. But even in cases 
where the experts are qualified, they often disagree. Hence, the 
common advice is to seek “a second opinion.” Depending on 
authority makes sense only when the experts all agree.
① qualification of reliable specialists
② error in relying on authority’s opinion
③ misjudgement from obsession with health
④ consideration about consulting an amateur
⑤ effective persuasion assisted by professionals

But in doing so, it will lose heat, and the cold ice cube will

A single ice cube is floating in a glass of water. You hold a 
piece of string about four inches long. ( ① )　Can you lift the 
cube out of the glass with the string without touching the ice

string across the cube and sprinkle salt on top of the ice. ( ④ ) 
The ice around the string will start to melt. ( ⑤ ) When you lift 
the string after a minute, the cube will adhere tightly to it.

The chart above shows the result of a survey, done in August 
2009 by Reader’s Digest international staff, with the question: 
“How often do you call your mother?” ① In India and China, the 
percentage of people who call every day is higher than that of 
people who call once a week. ② The percentage who call once 
a week in Germany and Indonesia, is respectively higher than 
that in any other country. ③ More than 30 percent of the 
respondents in the United States call their mother every day. 
④ The sum of the percentage who call every day and the 
percentage who call once a week in Russia is bigger than that in 
Canada. ⑤ The percentage who call every day in France is the 
same as that in the United Kingdom.
36. Snow leopard에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Snow leopards are considered shy because they are rarely 
seen in the wild. They live high in the mountains of central 
Asia, where plants are scarce. Their fur, which is typically 
yellowish-gray with black rosette-shaped spots, camouflages 
them in rocky and snowy conditions. Snow leopards’ large furry 
paws act like snowshoes to help them walk on snow. Their 
large paws also allow them to grip rocks. Snow leopards 
primarily prey on mountain sheep, goats, rodents, birds and 
deer. They hunt by hiding behind rocks on slopes above prey 
animals, then leaping down and pouncing on the prey. Snow 
leopards have extremely long tails, which aid their balance. 
Their long tails are also useful for covering their faces to stay 
warm while they’re resting.

Guyana is a country on the northern coast of South America. 
It achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1966 and 
became a republic in 1970. More than 80% of the land of 
Guyana is still covered by forests, ranging from dry evergreen 
to rain forests. Guyana has a tropical climate and unique 
surroundings. Approximately eight thousand species of plants 
occur in Guyana, half of which are found nowhere else. Such 
incredible diversity of plants supports even more impressive 
diversity of animal life. Unlike other areas of South America, 
most of the natural habitat remains conserved well.

38.  The first and best way for a baby to learn that exercise is a 
lifetime routine is by imitating his or her parents. You should be 
your child’s role model, incorporating physical activity into your 
daily routine and involving your child in your workout routine 
whenever possible. It’s great if you are already active, and you 
should continue to be even though it is difficult with a newborn, 
and even tougher if you have additional kids. If you have not been 
exercising, this is a good time to start. If weather permits, take 
your baby out for a walk every day. The baby will begin to 
associate these outdoor walks with physical activity.

39.  We all have different personalities. However, to successfully 
take good people pictures, you’ll need to be courageous ― even 
aggressive. Standing in public with a camera, asking people to 
pose for you, will require being the center of attention at times 
and that’s part of taking pictures. If you tend to be shy or timid, 
give yourself a push to be more aggressive when taking photos 
of people. Don’t be afraid to ask people to pose for you. When 
you do, try to be pleasant and tactful. Always thank people for 
being cooperative. You’ll find that your pictures will improve and 
you’ll have more fun too! Timid photographers rarely take good 
photos! 
① Don’t be shy when you make a speech.
② Use a digital camera to get a good portrait.
③ Practice hard to improve your drawing skill.
④ Be confident to take good pictures of people.
⑤ Remember to behave politely in public places.

Many contagious diseases spread through carriers such as 
birds and mosquitoes. These carriers move with heat and 
rainfall. With this in mind, researchers have begun to use 
satellite data to (A) observe / preserve the environmental 
conditions that lead to disease. “We could predict conditions 
that would result in the (B) appearance / disappearance of 
cholera, malaria, and even avian flu,” says an expert. The 
domestic duck, a common bird of Southeast Asia, is one of the 
main carriers of the H5N1 avian influenza. Scientists use 
satellite images to map agricultural patterns in the region. 
These maps show where the number of the ducks is most likely 
to (C) decrease / increase and thus where the avian influenza 
is most likely to spread.
(A) (B) (C)
① observe …… appearance …… decrease
② observe …… disappearance …… increase
③ observe …… appearance …… increase
④ preserve …… disappearance …… decrease
⑤ preserve …… appearance …… increase

Lately I’ve been distracted so easily. I’ve felt like I really 
want to accomplish more with my time. So I’ve tried to find 
out the causes of my distraction.
(A) Yes, I’m the first to agree. The thing is, everything must be 
done in moderation, and I haven’t been moderating my music 
very well! So I’m going to cut the music out and see how it 
goes. 
(B) One thing I’ve noticed, is that I was getting distracted by 
listening to too much music. I’d put off things I needed to 
do because I was caught up in whatever song I was 
listening to. 
(C) Even worse, my mind would wander to the music while I 
was doing other things, like reading or studying. The music 
was breaking my concentration. You may say, “But, music is 
good and wonderful!”

42.  Many people are trapped in their painful emotions instead of 
trying to overcome them. Rather than learn the positive message 
their painful emotions are trying to give them, they make them 
even worse. Moreover, people compete with others over how 
much painful emotions they have suffered. For example, they 
say, “Do you think you have a hard time out of painful 
experiences? Let me tell you how terrible my suffering is!” 
They just pride themselves on experiencing worse painful 
emotions than anyone else. As you can imagine, this is one of 
the deadliest traps of all, which should be avoided at all costs.

② How Can You Begin Positive Thinking?
③ Frustration: Meaningful Experience
④ Positive Views: Necessities in Life 
⑤ Finding One’s Own Identity
43.  The sounds heard during sleep can sharpen your memory. A 
dozen subjects took a memory test in which they learned the 
positions of 50 objects on a computer screen. Each picture was 
paired with its own little sound effect. An image of a shattering 
wine glass was accompanied by the sound of breaking glass. 
Little sticks of dynamite? Boom sound, and so on. Once the 
subjects learned to put the pictures where they belonged, they 
were encouraged to sleep. While they slept, scientists played 
the sounds for half the images presented during the memory 
test. And when the subjects woke up and retook the test, they 
were better at placing the 25 objects of which sounds they heard 
during the sleep. Sounds you hear while sleeping help enhance 
your memory.

The government spends billions of dollars on educational and 
prevention programs to persuade teens not to do things like 
smoke or drink. However, educational interventions alone are 
unlikely to be effective. I don’t want people to think that 
education should not continue. I just believe that it alone is not 
going to make much of a difference in preventing risky 
behavior. I strongly urge that stricter laws should be made to 
limit opportunities for immature judgement that often have 
harmful consequences. For example, strategies such as raising 
the price of cigarettes, enforcing laws governing the sale of 
alcohol or raising the driving age will definitely be effective.

The Fair Trade movement grows out of a variety of North 
American and European organizations. Since the 1940s, they 
have sought to help disadvantaged groups by creating 
alternative trade networks. Some pioneer organizations began 
purchasing handicrafts from poor producers in the third world 
nations at above-market prices, selling them directly to 
consumers. During the 1960s and 1970s, these organizations 
and their direct sales networks expanded significantly. The 
organizations in Europe established thousands of popular 
handicraft stores known as “World Shop.” Smaller 
organizations in North America sold through catalogues and 
small shops. By the 1980s these diverse efforts had shaped 
the beginning of a common Fair Trade movement.

(A)
Years ago there was a group of brilliant male students at the 
University of Wisconsin, who had amazing creative literary 
talent. These promising young men met regularly to analyze and 
criticize each other’s work. They were heartless, tough, even 
mean in their criticism. The sessions became such arenas of 
literary criticism that the members of this exclusive club called 
themselves the “Stranglers.” 
(B)
Twenty years later a graduate of the university was doing an 
exhaustive study of his classmates’ careers when he noticed a 
vast difference in the literary accomplishments of the 
Stranglers as opposed to the Wranglers. Of all the bright young 
men in the Stranglers, not one had made a significant literary 
accomplishment of any kind. From the Wranglers had come six 
or more successful writers. 
(C)
What caused the literary success of the Wranglers? Talent 
between the two? Probably the same. Level of education? Not 
much difference. But the Stranglers strangled, while the 
Wranglers gave each other a lift. The Stranglers promoted an 
atmosphere of argument and criticism. The Wranglers 
highlighted                                     . These are good examples 
of how to kill morale, as well as how to improve it.
(D)
Not to be outdone, the women of literary talent in the 
university were determined to start a club of their own, one 
comparable to the Stranglers. They called themselves the 
“Wranglers.” They, too, read their works to one another. But 
there was one great difference. The criticism was much softer, 
more positive, and more encouraging. Sometimes, there was 
almost no criticism at all. Every effort was encouraged.

Our happiness and our free self-expression is much more 
assured if we let go of end results; work toward our goals and 
not be imprisoned by them. We love the people who are least 
concerned about making an impression. They let go of any 
desperation for affection, so they automatically have the 
affection. People who make a lot of money, only start to make it 
when they stop working for it! In other words, they find 
something they love to do and the wealth flows in automatically. 
They have money because they let go of it. An outsider might 
say of someone who is financially successful, “The greedy pig. 
He is worth ten million dollars and he is still working!” The man 
is working because he loves the                 more than the 
money. That is why he is rich! In a sense we need to be able to 
live without something in order to have it. Once we can let go, 
we are in a position of great power. Successful businessmen 
know that the only way to pull off a successful deal is to 
release the deal ― to become emotionally unattached.
