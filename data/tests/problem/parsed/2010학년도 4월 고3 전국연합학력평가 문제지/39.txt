39.  We all have different personalities. However, to successfully 
take good people pictures, you’ll need to be courageous ― even 
aggressive. Standing in public with a camera, asking people to 
pose for you, will require being the center of attention at times 
and that’s part of taking pictures. If you tend to be shy or timid, 
give yourself a push to be more aggressive when taking photos 
of people. Don’t be afraid to ask people to pose for you. When 
you do, try to be pleasant and tactful. Always thank people for 
being cooperative. You’ll find that your pictures will improve and 
you’ll have more fun too! Timid photographers rarely take good 
photos!
