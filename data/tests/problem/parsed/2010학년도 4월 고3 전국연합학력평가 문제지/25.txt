25.  The language barrier cannot be regarded as a defect though it 
may present problems to the conversationalists. To overcome 
this, the people conversing should be considerate towards one 
another. It is both improper and impolite for persons in a group 
to engage themselves in conversation with one another in any 
language not known to all present. However, situations 
sometimes arise when communication is difficult, as is the case 
when we have foreigners in our midst. We do not understand 
them nor they us. But if the will to communicate is strong 
enough, language will not be a(n)                               . We 
always have, as a standby, communication by sign language, 
though it cannot really be called conversation.
