Olaudah Equiano was born in the area that is now 
southern Nigeria. He was kidnapped with his younger sister 
at the age of 11, sold by local slave traders and shipped to 
the British colony of Virginia. He was bought by a Royal 
Navy officer, Michael Pascal. Equiano traveled the oceans 
with Pascal for eight years, during which time he learned to 
read and write. Later Equiano was sold to the prominent 
merchant Robert King. While working for him, Equiano 
earned money by trading on the side. In three years, with 
his master’s permission, Equiano bought his freedom for the 
price of 40 pounds. Equiano then spent much of the next 20 
years traveling the world. Coming to London, he became 
involved in the movement to abolish slavery. In 1789 he 
published his autobiography, which became immensely 
popular and made Equiano a wealthy man. It depicts the 
horrors of slavery and influenced the establishment of the 
Slave Trade Act of 1807.
