We live in an age of constant interaction, and yet more of 
us are claiming we are “lonely” than ever before. Loneliness 
has nothing to do with how many people are physically around 
us, but has everything to do with our failure to get what we 
need from our relationships. Virtual personalities online and 
characters on television (A) fulfill / neglect our natural emotional­ 
needs artificially, and hence occupy the blurry margins in 
which our brains have difficulty distinguishing real from 
unreal. The more we rely on these personalities and 
characters to get a sense of (B) “ isolation / connectedness  ,” 
the more our brains encode them as “relevant.” This means our 
brains can be tricked, and the irony is that we are complicit in 
the deception. As need­driven animals, we seek out the paths 
of (C) least / most  resistance to get what we need, and 
electronic immersion provides the most accessible, nonchemical 
path yet invented.
