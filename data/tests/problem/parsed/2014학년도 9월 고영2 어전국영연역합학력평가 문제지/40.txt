Participants in a laboratory study were asked to listen 
to a pair of very loud, unpleasant noises played through 
headphones. One noise lasted for eight seconds. The 
other lasted sixteen. The first eight seconds of the 
second noise were identical to the first noise, whereas 
the second eight seconds, while still loud and unpleasant, 
were not as loud. Later, the participants were told that 
they would have to listen to one of the noises again, but 
that they could choose which one. Clearly the second 
noise is worse — the unpleasantness lasted twice as long. 
Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of people chose 
the second to be repeated. Why? Because whereas both 
noises were unpleasant and had the same irritating peak, 
the second had a less unpleasant end, and so was 
remembered as less annoying than the first.
