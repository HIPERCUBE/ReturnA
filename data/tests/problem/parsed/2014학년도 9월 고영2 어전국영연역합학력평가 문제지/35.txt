35. Though efficiency is a great virtue, it is not the only 
economic goal of interest to the society. Economic fairness 
is also crucial. ① Fairness refers to the distribution of 
income and well­being, as well as to the ways that 
government treats its citizens. ② Most people would regard 
as unfair a market equilibrium in which some individuals are 
super­rich while others are dying of extreme poverty. ③ In 
such a circumstance, most people would regard it as fair for 
the government to tax the super­rich in order to provide 
basic resources for the poor. ④ Fairness to the future, 
therefore, involves the idea that the living generation must 
be protectors of the earth’s resources for the generations 
that will come later. ⑤ Indeed, a solid 63 percent of 
Americans agree that “It is the responsibility of government 
to take care of people who can’t take care of themselves.”
