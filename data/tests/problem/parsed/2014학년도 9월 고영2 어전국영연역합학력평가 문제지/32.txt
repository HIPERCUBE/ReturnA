32. Renowned investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren 
Buffett once said, “You can determine the strength of a 
business over time by the amount of agony they go through 
in raising prices.” Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, 
realized that as customers form routines around a product, 
they come to depend upon it and become less 
price­sensitive. The duo have pointed to consumer 
psychology as the rationale behind their famed investments 
in companies like See’s Candies and Coca­Cola. Buffett and 
Munger understand that                                . 
For example, in the free­to­play video game business, it is 
standard practice for game developers to delay asking users 
to pay money until they have played consistently and 
habitually. Once the compulsion to play is in place and the 
desire to progress in the game increases, converting users 
into paying customers is much easier. Selling virtual items, 
extra lives, and special powers is where the real money 
lies. [3점]
