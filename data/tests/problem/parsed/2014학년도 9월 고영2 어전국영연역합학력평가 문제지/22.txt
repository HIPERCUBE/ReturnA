You probably know that you can’t tickle yourself. Although 
you might be able to tickle a total stranger, your brain also 
strongly discourages you from doing something so socially 
awkward. These facts offer insight into tickling’s 
evolutionary purpose, says Robert R. Provine, the author of 
the book Laughter: A Scientific Investigation. Tickling, he 
says, is partly a mechanism for social bonding between 
close companions and helps strengthen relationships between 
family members and friends. Laughter in response to tickling 
kicks in during the first few months of life. “It’s one of the 
first forms of communication between babies and their 
caregivers,” Provine says. The face­to­face activity also 
opens the door for other interactions.
