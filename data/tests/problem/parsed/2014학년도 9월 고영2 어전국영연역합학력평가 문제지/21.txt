Some species of prey are brightly colored all over, and do 
not show any tendency towards crypsis. It is a little 
puzzling that such prey have coloring that makes it very 
easy for predators to detect them. The puzzle is largely 
solved when it is realized that such prey are often 
distasteful. Evidence that it is useful for distasteful prey to 
be easily detected or conspicuous was reported by Gittleman 
and Harvey. Chicks were presented with breadcrumbs which 
had been made distasteful. Initially, the chicks ate more of 
the breadcrumb prey when they were easily detected rather 
than hard to detect. However, the conspicuous or easily 
detected prey were eaten much less than the cryptic prey 
later on. Presumably chicks find it easier to avoid 
distasteful prey when it is conspicuous than when it is 
cryptic.
