36. The same media that serve and reflect the rise of 
personal preference — movies, television, photography, music, 
advertising, art, and others — often produce place images. 
① Place, portrayer, and medium interact to produce the 
image, which, in turn, colors our perception of and beliefs 
about places and regions we have never visited. ② The 
images may be inaccurate or misleading, but they 
nevertheless create a world in our minds that has an array 
of unique places and place meanings. ③ Our decisions about 
tourism and migration can be influenced by these images. 
④ Today, the development of tourism and housing for 
wealthy non­locals threatens the survival of the native 
culture and language. ⑤ For example, through the media, 
Hawaii has become in the American mind a sort of earthly 
paradise, a tourist destination with happy, invariably 
good­looking natives who live in a setting of natural beauty.
