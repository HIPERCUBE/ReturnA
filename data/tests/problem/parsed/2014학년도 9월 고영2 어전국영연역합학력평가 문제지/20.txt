By nearly all insider and expert accounts, we are or will 
be at peak oil somewhere between now and the next five 
years. Even if we did not have profound concerns about 
climate change, we would need to be looking for different 
ways to power our civilization. How fortunate we are to 
have a safe nuclear facility a mere ninety­three million 
miles away. I hope I live to see the full flourishing of solar 
technology. Concentrated solar power to superheat steam, 
electric mobility and electricity storage are part of this new 
quest. My hope is that architects will be drawn to designing 
gorgeous arrays and solar towers in the desert. Could it be 
possible that in two or three decades we will look back and 
wonder why we ever thought we had a problem when we 
are bathed in such a sweet rain of photons?
