Therefore, the keyboard design strategy was to position 
the most frequently used keys as far apart as possible to 
minimize the possibility that the keys would stick together.  
Most of the key positions in the keyboard layout on 
computers today are the result of the design of the keys 
for the typewriter. ( ① ) The early typewriter characters 
were positioned at the end of a long piece of metal and 
struck the paper through a ribbon when the user pressed 
the key on the keyboard. ( ② ) When the typist typed too 
fast, the keys would get caught on each other. ( ③ ) That 
design makes no sense for the computer keyboard since 
there are no mechanical arms striking anything, only 
electronic signals. ( ④ ) However, the early designers of 
computers determined that adhering to current keyboard 
layouts would make typists more comfortable with the 
computer. ( ⑤ ) The result is a keyboard layout that 
maximizes finger movement instead of minimizing it.
