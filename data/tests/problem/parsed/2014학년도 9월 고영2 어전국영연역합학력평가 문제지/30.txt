30. Teams made up of diverse specialists are infamous for 
their inability to get things done. Despite the best­laid plans 
of the managers who assemble such teams, the differences 
among members frequently lead to poor communication, 
conflict, and confusion. Members new to one another simply 
don’t understand when and how to communicate. Some 
groups never master this; and even in groups that do, the 
process takes time, slowing progress toward team goals.     
can help a group overcome this obstacle: 
Once a team has learned when and how to communicate on 
one project, it can carry those skills over to the next. 
Research shows that many teams struggle to make use of 
the knowledge each individual brings to the task, because 
their members don’t know who has what information. 
Discovering this knowledge can take time and effort; the 
more frequently the same individuals work together, the 
better an organization performs. [3점]
