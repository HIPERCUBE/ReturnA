A plan was announced to install a new 400­acre landfill at 
Corcolle. Corcolle is an area of immense cultural and natural 
value not only for Italy but for all of humanity. To speak 
only of the most obvious site that requires our watchful and 
eternal protection, we note that Hadrian’s Villa is only a 
short distance from the proposed landfill. This unique 
UNESCO World Heritage Site is visited each year by 
hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world. It 
is unthinkable that it or its immediate surroundings should 
suffer degradation of the kind that the proposed landfill 
clearly represents. Even the Province of Rome and the 
Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities have expressed 
their concerns. We appeal to the Ministry of the 
Environment to announce immediately that the proposed 
project for a landfill at Corcolle will once and for all be 
abandoned to protect Hadrian’s Villa.

Many people choose to adopt a new pet when their old 
pet passes away. This is their way of replacing a loss with 
a gain. We are faced with two choices whenever trouble 
surfaces: we can dwell on the moment and maintain the pain 
it causes or we can choose to act against it. Acting against 
adversity means cultivating positivity in whatever way you 
can. If you’ve lost your job, seek not one but two. If you’ve 
recently separated from your significant other, take time to 
rediscover your personal needs and improve your natural 
abilities. Most important is not allowing yourself to fall 
victim to your circumstances; you have the ability to 
counteract negativity with positivity. Choose, instead, to 
outsmart your challenges by productively working against 
them. That we hold the power to influence our 
circumstances is a very reassuring thought.

By nearly all insider and expert accounts, we are or will 
be at peak oil somewhere between now and the next five 
years. Even if we did not have profound concerns about 
climate change, we would need to be looking for different 
ways to power our civilization. How fortunate we are to 
have a safe nuclear facility a mere ninety­three million 
miles away. I hope I live to see the full flourishing of solar 
technology. Concentrated solar power to superheat steam, 
electric mobility and electricity storage are part of this new 
quest. My hope is that architects will be drawn to designing 
gorgeous arrays and solar towers in the desert. Could it be 
possible that in two or three decades we will look back and 
wonder why we ever thought we had a problem when we 
are bathed in such a sweet rain of photons?

21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Some species of prey are brightly colored all over, and do 
not show any tendency towards crypsis. It is a little 
puzzling that such prey have coloring that makes it very 
easy for predators to detect them. The puzzle is largely 
solved when it is realized that such prey are often 
distasteful. Evidence that it is useful for distasteful prey to 
be easily detected or conspicuous was reported by Gittleman 
and Harvey. Chicks were presented with breadcrumbs which 
had been made distasteful. Initially, the chicks ate more of 
the breadcrumb prey when they were easily detected rather 
than hard to detect. However, the conspicuous or easily 
detected prey were eaten much less than the cryptic prey 
later on. Presumably chicks find it easier to avoid 
distasteful prey when it is conspicuous than when it is 
cryptic.

You probably know that you can’t tickle yourself. Although 
you might be able to tickle a total stranger, your brain also 
strongly discourages you from doing something so socially 
awkward. These facts offer insight into tickling’s 
evolutionary purpose, says Robert R. Provine, the author of 
the book Laughter: A Scientific Investigation. Tickling, he 
says, is partly a mechanism for social bonding between 
close companions and helps strengthen relationships between 
family members and friends. Laughter in response to tickling 
kicks in during the first few months of life. “It’s one of the 
first forms of communication between babies and their 
caregivers,” Provine says. The face­to­face activity also 
opens the door for other interactions.
① positive impacts of laughter on communication
② harmful influence of tickling on new­born babies
③ effects of physical contact on cognitive development   
④ role of tickling in building bonds between close relations  
⑤ importance of verbal interaction between parents and babies

24. short­horned lizard에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Short­horned lizards are small, flat, round lizards that have 
short, stubby horns. They are found in the deserts and 
semi­arid environments of North and Central America. 
During hot weather, they are most active during the morning 
hours and less active in the afternoon. Short­horned lizards 
prefer soft, sandy soils, near rocks where they can blend in 
with the background. They can quickly burrow into loose 
soil to hide. Their color varies from red­brown to 
yellow­grey, depending upon their surroundings, since their 
color provides them with camouflage. Their underside is 
white or light gray, without spots. When threatened, they 
are capable of blowing up their bodies up to twice their 
normal size. And if this proves insufficient, they shoot blood 
from their eyes to confuse their predators. The blood can 
travel a distance of up to three feet.
* semi‐arid: 반건조 기후의
① 날씨가 더울 때는 오후에 가장 활동적이다.

25. Olaudah Equiano에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Olaudah Equiano was born in the area that is now 
southern Nigeria. He was kidnapped with his younger sister 
at the age of 11, sold by local slave traders and shipped to 
the British colony of Virginia. He was bought by a Royal 
Navy officer, Michael Pascal. Equiano traveled the oceans 
with Pascal for eight years, during which time he learned to 
read and write. Later Equiano was sold to the prominent 
merchant Robert King. While working for him, Equiano 
earned money by trading on the side. In three years, with 
his master’s permission, Equiano bought his freedom for the 
price of 40 pounds. Equiano then spent much of the next 20 
years traveling the world. Coming to London, he became 
involved in the movement to abolish slavery. In 1789 he 
published his autobiography, which became immensely 
popular and made Equiano a wealthy man. It depicts the 
horrors of slavery and influenced the establishment of the 
Slave Trade Act of 1807.

The graph above shows trends in advertising revenue by 
media type from 2005 to 2013. ① Between 2005 and 2007, 
the amount of advertising revenue earned by newspapers 
was the largest among the five media types. ② However, 
the newspaper ad revenue had continuously dropped since 
2005 and ranked the second from the bottom in 2013, next 
to the ad revenue of radio. ③ Since 2005, the Internet ad 
revenue had noticeably increased, and in 2013 it surpassed 
the previously leading ad revenue source, broadcast TV. 
④ The ad revenue of cable TV had increased steadily since 
2005 and became more than twice that of radio in 2009. 
⑤ Between 2009 and 2013, unlike the other four media 
types, the radio ad revenue changed little, remaining around 
15 billion dollars.

Language is one of the primary features that distinguishes 
humans from other animals. Many animals, including 
dolphins, whales, and birds, ① do indeed communicate with 
one another through patterned systems of sounds, scents, 
and other chemicals, or movements. Furthermore, some 
nonhuman primates ② have been taught to use sign 
language to communicate with humans. However, the 
complexity of human language, its ability to convey nuanced 
emotions and ideas, and its importance for our existence as 
social animals ③ setting it apart from the communication 
systems used by other animals. In many ways, language is 
the essence of culture. It provides the single most common 
variable ④ by which different cultural groups are identified. 
Language not only facilitates the cultural diffusion of 
innovations, it also helps to shape the way we think about, 
perceive, and ⑤ name our environment.

We live in an age of constant interaction, and yet more of 
us are claiming we are “lonely” than ever before. Loneliness 
has nothing to do with how many people are physically around 
us, but has everything to do with our failure to get what we 
need from our relationships. Virtual personalities online and 
characters on television (A) fulfill / neglect our natural emotional­ 
needs artificially, and hence occupy the blurry margins in 
which our brains have difficulty distinguishing real from 
unreal. The more we rely on these personalities and 
characters to get a sense of (B) “ isolation / connectedness  ,” 
the more our brains encode them as “relevant.” This means our 
brains can be tricked, and the irony is that we are complicit in 
the deception. As need­driven animals, we seek out the paths 
of (C) least / most  resistance to get what we need, and 
electronic immersion provides the most accessible, nonchemical 
path yet invented.

Two brothers were convicted of stealing sheep. They 
each were branded on the forehead with the letters ST for 
“sheep thief.” One brother was so embarrassed by this 
branding that he ran away; he was never heard from again. 
① The other brother, filled with regret, chose to stay in the 
village and try to make amends for his offenses. Whenever 
there was work needing to be done, ② the sheep thief came 
to help with a lending hand. Never accepting pay for his 
good deeds, ③ he lived his life for others. Many years later, 
a traveler came through the village. Sitting at a sidewalk 
cafe, the traveler saw an old man with a strange brand on 
his forehead seated nearby. He noticed that all the villagers 
who passed ④ the man stopped to share a kind word or to 
pay their respects. Curious, the stranger asked a resident of 
the village what the letters stood for. ⑤ The villager 
replied, “I don’t know. It happened so long ago... but I think 
it stands for ‘saint.’”

30. Teams made up of diverse specialists are infamous for 
their inability to get things done. Despite the best­laid plans 
of the managers who assemble such teams, the differences 
among members frequently lead to poor communication, 
conflict, and confusion. Members new to one another simply 
don’t understand when and how to communicate. Some 
groups never master this; and even in groups that do, the 
process takes time, slowing progress toward team goals.     
can help a group overcome this obstacle: 
Once a team has learned when and how to communicate on 
one project, it can carry those skills over to the next. 
Research shows that many teams struggle to make use of 
the knowledge each individual brings to the task, because 
their members don’t know who has what information. 
Discovering this knowledge can take time and effort; the 
more frequently the same individuals work together, the 
better an organization performs. [3점]

31. One of our brains’ especially frustrating habits is to focus 
on getting a reward, and then experience a feeling of loss 
once we get it. This cycle can spin us into a loop of 
wanting, getting, and regretting. Awareness that you are 
caught in the cycle is essential. If you are bidding on items 
online and find yourself compelled to keep bidding up the 
price of an item beyond its value or what you intended to 
spend, force yourself to become aware that what you are 
doing is no longer in your best interest. The action part is 
harder because you have to abandon the target. If you don’t, 
you cannot expect merely thinking rationally to correct the 
problem, because it rarely ever does. We are master 
justifiers, and almost any rational reason given for stopping 
an action can be taken apart in minutes or less. Action in 
this case is absolutely necessary:                          .

① abandon rationality
② stick to your plans
③ stop and walk away
④ jump at the chance
⑤ let your heart lead you
32. Renowned investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren 
Buffett once said, “You can determine the strength of a 
business over time by the amount of agony they go through 
in raising prices.” Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, 
realized that as customers form routines around a product, 
they come to depend upon it and become less 
price­sensitive. The duo have pointed to consumer 
psychology as the rationale behind their famed investments 
in companies like See’s Candies and Coca­Cola. Buffett and 
Munger understand that                                . 
For example, in the free­to­play video game business, it is 
standard practice for game developers to delay asking users 
to pay money until they have played consistently and 
habitually. Once the compulsion to play is in place and the 
desire to progress in the game increases, converting users 
into paying customers is much easier. Selling virtual items, 
extra lives, and special powers is where the real money 
lies. [3점]
① companies should diversify their investments
② quality is valued more than price by consumers
③ rational decisions are more persuasive than habits 
④ customers are often easy to lose but hard to regain
⑤ habits give companies greater flexibility to increase prices

To be persuaded by a message, you must pay attention to 
that message. This simple fact has led to the development 
of numerous procedures designed to attract attention, such 
as printing signs upside down or backwards, using vivid 
colors, and using unusual music and sounds.    (A)   , 
unless the sights and sounds are the message, the story 
does not end here. The audience must attend to the 
message that accompanies these attention­getters. Therefore, 
the message itself must be powerful enough to command 
attention. If we continue to attend to the unusual sights and 
sounds and never hear the message, persuasion will not 
occur. If the music is too catchy,    (B)   , we may 
remember the music and not the product that is being

When I looked back, it was almost on me. I forced myself 
to keep running, my heart beating wildly. But it kept on 
coming, more determined than ever to catch me. I ran into 
a small hut near the end of the village, hoping I could find 
protection there; but the hut was empty and that horrible, 
nightmarish creature grew closer with every step. When I 
saw its looming shadow in the doorway, I flattened myself 
against the far wall. It came toward me, my screams for 
help growing louder with every step it took. Finally, it was 
but mere inches from my face. I closed my eyes and prayed 
for a quick death. It reached slowly with its massive claws 
toward me and said, “I got you!”

35. Though efficiency is a great virtue, it is not the only 
economic goal of interest to the society. Economic fairness 
is also crucial. ① Fairness refers to the distribution of 
income and well­being, as well as to the ways that 
government treats its citizens. ② Most people would regard 
as unfair a market equilibrium in which some individuals are 
super­rich while others are dying of extreme poverty. ③ In 
such a circumstance, most people would regard it as fair for 
the government to tax the super­rich in order to provide 
basic resources for the poor. ④ Fairness to the future, 
therefore, involves the idea that the living generation must 
be protectors of the earth’s resources for the generations 
that will come later. ⑤ Indeed, a solid 63 percent of 
Americans agree that “It is the responsibility of government 
to take care of people who can’t take care of themselves.”
36. The same media that serve and reflect the rise of 
personal preference — movies, television, photography, music, 
advertising, art, and others — often produce place images. 
① Place, portrayer, and medium interact to produce the 
image, which, in turn, colors our perception of and beliefs 
about places and regions we have never visited. ② The 
images may be inaccurate or misleading, but they 
nevertheless create a world in our minds that has an array 
of unique places and place meanings. ③ Our decisions about 
tourism and migration can be influenced by these images. 
④ Today, the development of tourism and housing for 
wealthy non­locals threatens the survival of the native 
culture and language. ⑤ For example, through the media, 
Hawaii has become in the American mind a sort of earthly 
paradise, a tourist destination with happy, invariably 
good­looking natives who live in a setting of natural beauty.

Here’s a fascinating social experiment. Select one 
hundred people at random in New York City and ask them 
each to list all their friends, so you can figure out their 
average number of friends. Then, in turn, ask their friends how many friends they have.
(A) The explanation lies in the realization that there is a 
bias in the question being asked, since you are more 
likely to know popular people and less likely to know 
unpopular ones. 
(B) That is also why people at your local gym tend to be 
fitter than you, because you do not encounter the 
relatively out­of­shape ones who rarely turn up.
(C) You will find that the latter’s average number of friends 
is higher. Sociologist Scott Feld of Purdue University 
drew attention to this apparent paradox.

The tank was a British invention. Early in the war 
inventors came to the army leaders with the idea but the 
army rejected it as impractical.
(A) More than half of them broke down before they got to  
the German trenches. They were not very reliable. It 
was not until a year later that tanks actually achieved 
great success. They blasted through enemy lines so 
quickly that the infantry could not keep up.
(B) They caused alarm among the Germans and raised the 
morale of the British troops. Surely this was the weapon 
that could achieve a breakthrough! However, these first 
machines only moved at walking pace. 
(C) However, Winston Churchill, head of the navy, thought 
the idea had potential and his department funded its 
development. Two years later the tanks were used for 
the first time at the Battle of the Somme. They 
advanced ahead of the infantry, crushing defences and

Therefore, the keyboard design strategy was to position 
the most frequently used keys as far apart as possible to 
minimize the possibility that the keys would stick together.  
Most of the key positions in the keyboard layout on 
computers today are the result of the design of the keys 
for the typewriter. ( ① ) The early typewriter characters 
were positioned at the end of a long piece of metal and 
struck the paper through a ribbon when the user pressed 
the key on the keyboard. ( ② ) When the typist typed too 
fast, the keys would get caught on each other. ( ③ ) That 
design makes no sense for the computer keyboard since 
there are no mechanical arms striking anything, only 
electronic signals. ( ④ ) However, the early designers of 
computers determined that adhering to current keyboard 
layouts would make typists more comfortable with the 
computer. ( ⑤ ) The result is a keyboard layout that 
maximizes finger movement instead of minimizing it.

Participants in a laboratory study were asked to listen 
to a pair of very loud, unpleasant noises played through 
headphones. One noise lasted for eight seconds. The 
other lasted sixteen. The first eight seconds of the 
second noise were identical to the first noise, whereas 
the second eight seconds, while still loud and unpleasant, 
were not as loud. Later, the participants were told that 
they would have to listen to one of the noises again, but 
that they could choose which one. Clearly the second 
noise is worse — the unpleasantness lasted twice as long. 
Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of people chose 
the second to be repeated. Why? Because whereas both 
noises were unpleasant and had the same irritating peak, 
the second had a less unpleasant end, and so was 
remembered as less annoying than the first.

In a 1996 research project led by Roy Baumeister at 
Case Western Reserve University, scientists had two 
groups of people sit down in separate rooms. On the 
table in the rooms were two bowls, one was of fresh 
chocolate chip cookies and the other contained radishes. 
The first group was told that they could eat as many of 
the cookies that they wanted but that they were to avoid 
the radishes at all costs. The second group was told the 
opposite. After a while the scientists came back in and 
asked the participants to wait. Each group was given an 
“easy” puzzle to solve while they waited. The puzzle 
actually had no solution but the scientists wanted to see 
how long each group would attempt to find the solution. 
The results were that the people who had to resist the 
cookies only spent 8 minutes on the puzzle while the 
other group spent an average of 19 minutes on it. Why? 
It appears that willpower is finite. The people who were 
told to resist the cookies had                for the day.
Think about it. Have you ever had a task you normally 
do in the morning and forgotten about it? Then, when you 
remember, you say that you are going to do it as soon as 
you get home? But, you don’t. That’s because you have 
spent the willpower that you have been allotted for the day. 
So, if you are wanting to accomplish a specific goal, it is 
best if you set aside some time in the morning, before your 
daily routine begins, and get something done on it while 
you still have your full store of willpower for the day.

(A)
His head lowered, an exhausted but determined young 
man chanted over and over to himself, “You can do this. 
You can do it, you can do it.” His sneakers slapped the 
asphalt. It was a very tired patter. Looking up, the youth 
searched for a glimpse of the finish line. “It’s somewhere 
up there,” (a) he told himself. It was far off in the distance. 
Even so, Chris Burke had his heart set on reaching it. With 
great effort, he, too, crossed the finish line. 
 (B)
When at last the reporter turned to the camera to make 
concluding remarks, Chris instantly stepped forward and 
thrust out his hand to receive a congratulatory handshake. 
“Oh, boy!” (b) he shouted, unable to restrain his obvious joy. 
“I just want to tell you what a thrill this was and how happy 
I am to have come in third!” The reporter was startled but 
had little choice but to respond to the charismatic and 
enthusiastic athlete, wanting his turn at recognition. “Yes... 
tell us about it,” (c) he stammered. 
(C)
By the time he did, photographers and reporters had 
already gathered around the young man who had taken 
first place. Cameras flashed; microphones stretched 
forward to absorb the winner’s words. With a smile 
stretching from ear to ear, Chris proudly stood next to 
the winner. (d) He wrapped his arm around the young 
man — someone he had never met prior to this event. 
Beaming, Chris patiently waited for the reporter to 
complete his interview with the victor. 
(D)
“Wow!” said Chris. “Thank you for asking me to be 
interviewed. I’m just very happy to be here. Of course, I 
finished in third place. Third place, not bad! Not bad, huh?” 
He turned his animated face for all the world to see — this 
was national television — and he said, “Thank you all for 
sharing in this very special time with me. It’s time to 
celebrate!” Then (e) he lined up for hugs and handshakes 
alongside the winner. Chris was fourteen years old at the 
time. He had Down syndrome and this was the Special 
Olympics. There were only three runners in the entire race.
