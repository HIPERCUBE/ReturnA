31. One of our brains’ especially frustrating habits is to focus 
on getting a reward, and then experience a feeling of loss 
once we get it. This cycle can spin us into a loop of 
wanting, getting, and regretting. Awareness that you are 
caught in the cycle is essential. If you are bidding on items 
online and find yourself compelled to keep bidding up the 
price of an item beyond its value or what you intended to 
spend, force yourself to become aware that what you are 
doing is no longer in your best interest. The action part is 
harder because you have to abandon the target. If you don’t, 
you cannot expect merely thinking rationally to correct the 
problem, because it rarely ever does. We are master 
justifiers, and almost any rational reason given for stopping 
an action can be taken apart in minutes or less. Action in 
this case is absolutely necessary:                          .
