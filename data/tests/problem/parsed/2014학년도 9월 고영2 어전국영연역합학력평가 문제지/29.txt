Two brothers were convicted of stealing sheep. They 
each were branded on the forehead with the letters ST for 
“sheep thief.” One brother was so embarrassed by this 
branding that he ran away; he was never heard from again. 
① The other brother, filled with regret, chose to stay in the 
village and try to make amends for his offenses. Whenever 
there was work needing to be done, ② the sheep thief came 
to help with a lending hand. Never accepting pay for his 
good deeds, ③ he lived his life for others. Many years later, 
a traveler came through the village. Sitting at a sidewalk 
cafe, the traveler saw an old man with a strange brand on 
his forehead seated nearby. He noticed that all the villagers 
who passed ④ the man stopped to share a kind word or to 
pay their respects. Curious, the stranger asked a resident of 
the village what the letters stood for. ⑤ The villager 
replied, “I don’t know. It happened so long ago... but I think 
it stands for ‘saint.’”
