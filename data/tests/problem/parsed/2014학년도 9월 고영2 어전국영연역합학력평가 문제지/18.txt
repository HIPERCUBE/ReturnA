A plan was announced to install a new 400­acre landfill at 
Corcolle. Corcolle is an area of immense cultural and natural 
value not only for Italy but for all of humanity. To speak 
only of the most obvious site that requires our watchful and 
eternal protection, we note that Hadrian’s Villa is only a 
short distance from the proposed landfill. This unique 
UNESCO World Heritage Site is visited each year by 
hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world. It 
is unthinkable that it or its immediate surroundings should 
suffer degradation of the kind that the proposed landfill 
clearly represents. Even the Province of Rome and the 
Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities have expressed 
their concerns. We appeal to the Ministry of the 
Environment to announce immediately that the proposed 
project for a landfill at Corcolle will once and for all be 
abandoned to protect Hadrian’s Villa.
