Short­horned lizards are small, flat, round lizards that have 
short, stubby horns. They are found in the deserts and 
semi­arid environments of North and Central America. 
During hot weather, they are most active during the morning 
hours and less active in the afternoon. Short­horned lizards 
prefer soft, sandy soils, near rocks where they can blend in 
with the background. They can quickly burrow into loose 
soil to hide. Their color varies from red­brown to 
yellow­grey, depending upon their surroundings, since their 
color provides them with camouflage. Their underside is 
white or light gray, without spots. When threatened, they 
are capable of blowing up their bodies up to twice their 
normal size. And if this proves insufficient, they shoot blood 
from their eyes to confuse their predators. The blood can 
travel a distance of up to three feet.
