Many people choose to adopt a new pet when their old 
pet passes away. This is their way of replacing a loss with 
a gain. We are faced with two choices whenever trouble 
surfaces: we can dwell on the moment and maintain the pain 
it causes or we can choose to act against it. Acting against 
adversity means cultivating positivity in whatever way you 
can. If you’ve lost your job, seek not one but two. If you’ve 
recently separated from your significant other, take time to 
rediscover your personal needs and improve your natural 
abilities. Most important is not allowing yourself to fall 
victim to your circumstances; you have the ability to 
counteract negativity with positivity. Choose, instead, to 
outsmart your challenges by productively working against 
them. That we hold the power to influence our 
circumstances is a very reassuring thought.
