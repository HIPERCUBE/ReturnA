Here’s a fascinating social experiment. Select one 
hundred people at random in New York City and ask them 
each to list all their friends, so you can figure out their 
average number of friends. Then, in turn, ask their friends how many friends they have.
(A) The explanation lies in the realization that there is a 
bias in the question being asked, since you are more 
likely to know popular people and less likely to know 
unpopular ones. 
(B) That is also why people at your local gym tend to be 
fitter than you, because you do not encounter the 
relatively out­of­shape ones who rarely turn up.
(C) You will find that the latter’s average number of friends 
is higher. Sociologist Scott Feld of Purdue University 
drew attention to this apparent paradox.
