In a 1996 research project led by Roy Baumeister at 
Case Western Reserve University, scientists had two 
groups of people sit down in separate rooms. On the 
table in the rooms were two bowls, one was of fresh 
chocolate chip cookies and the other contained radishes. 
The first group was told that they could eat as many of 
the cookies that they wanted but that they were to avoid 
the radishes at all costs. The second group was told the 
opposite. After a while the scientists came back in and 
asked the participants to wait. Each group was given an 
“easy” puzzle to solve while they waited. The puzzle 
actually had no solution but the scientists wanted to see 
how long each group would attempt to find the solution. 
The results were that the people who had to resist the 
cookies only spent 8 minutes on the puzzle while the 
other group spent an average of 19 minutes on it. Why? 
It appears that willpower is finite. The people who were 
told to resist the cookies had                for the day.
Think about it. Have you ever had a task you normally 
do in the morning and forgotten about it? Then, when you 
remember, you say that you are going to do it as soon as 
you get home? But, you don’t. That’s because you have 
spent the willpower that you have been allotted for the day. 
So, if you are wanting to accomplish a specific goal, it is 
best if you set aside some time in the morning, before your 
daily routine begins, and get something done on it while 
you still have your full store of willpower for the day.
