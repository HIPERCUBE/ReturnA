The tank was a British invention. Early in the war 
inventors came to the army leaders with the idea but the 
army rejected it as impractical.
(A) More than half of them broke down before they got to  
the German trenches. They were not very reliable. It 
was not until a year later that tanks actually achieved 
great success. They blasted through enemy lines so 
quickly that the infantry could not keep up.
(B) They caused alarm among the Germans and raised the 
morale of the British troops. Surely this was the weapon 
that could achieve a breakthrough! However, these first 
machines only moved at walking pace. 
(C) However, Winston Churchill, head of the navy, thought 
the idea had potential and his department funded its 
development. Two years later the tanks were used for 
the first time at the Battle of the Somme. They 
advanced ahead of the infantry, crushing defences and 
spraying the enemy with machine­gun fire.
