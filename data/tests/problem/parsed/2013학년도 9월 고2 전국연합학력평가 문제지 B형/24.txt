In numerous experiments, conducted mostly at Brandeis
University, psychologist Theresa Amabile sought the
conditions that might influence creativity. In a typical
experiment, she would ask the participants to produce some
creative product. Depending on the experiment, the product
might be a poem or a short story. In the experiment,
Amabile would tell some of the participants that their
products were going to be evaluated for creativity by a panel
of experts. Other participants were told nothing about
evaluation or about any consequences. The results of these
experiments were quite consistent. The participants who
made the most creative products were those who did not
know that their products would be evaluated. They were the
ones just playing, not concerned about judgments.
