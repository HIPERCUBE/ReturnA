In April 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
ruled that toothpaste manufacturers weren’t adhering
closely enough to voluntary safety guidelines. As a result,
all toothpaste tubes now bear a scary­sounding warning.
(A) In the months following the new warning, toothpaste
consumer lines fielded hundreds of questions from
worried parents, and poison control centers were flooded
with calls as well. They told parents the same thing:
your child is fine and may vomit, or not.
(B) It was like this one: “Keep out of the reach of children
under 6 years of age. If more than used for brushing is
accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a
poison control center right away.”
(C) The only reason to see a doctor, however, is if the
vomiting gets so serious that dehydration becomes an
issue. That’s right: you can eat your fill of delicious
toothpaste and not come away with anything more
serious than nausea and diarrhea.
