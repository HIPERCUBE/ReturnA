23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Leaders and managers used to be told to keep a stiff
upper lip and not show emotion, to remove emotion from
the situation at hand and just deal with the facts. Despite
all your efforts to mask emotions, they will come out in
some form and people have an innate ability to pick up on
this. Emotions are always at play, so we need to reframe
the role that emotions play in the workplace. We need to
view emotions as the fuel that drives the engine of
productivity and innovation. The reality is that you will
never separate emotions from your workplace. Individuals
who are good at dealing with the tough stuff are those who
have learned, and even mastered, the art of managing
emotions. So, instead of spending time in trying to push
aside or suppress emotions, it is far better to learn how to
manage them well.
① 감정 표출은 정신 건강에 이롭다.
② 감정 조절을 통해 인내심을 길러야 한다.
③ 지도자는 구성원의 의견을 경청해야 한다.
④ 감정을 억제하기보다 잘 다룰 줄 알아야 한다.
⑤ 성공적 경영을 위해 이성적 판단을 해야 한다.
24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
In numerous experiments, conducted mostly at Brandeis
University, psychologist Theresa Amabile sought the
conditions that might influence creativity. In a typical
experiment, she would ask the participants to produce some
creative product. Depending on the experiment, the product
might be a poem or a short story. In the experiment,
Amabile would tell some of the participants that their
products were going to be evaluated for creativity by a panel
of experts. Other participants were told nothing about
evaluation or about any consequences. The results of these
experiments were quite consistent. The participants who
made the most creative products were those who did not
know that their products would be evaluated. They were the
ones just playing, not concerned about judgments.
① Expectation of evaluation inhibits creativity.
② Compliments can enhance student creativity.
③ Regular reading motivates students to study.
④ Creativity can be improved by writing in school.
⑤ Playful attitudes lower the quality of student work.
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
A few years ago, I received a surprise birthday present
from a friend― a tandem skydive. Falling through the sky
fifteen thousand feet from the ground was never on my
wish list. All the same, that was exactly what I was about
to do. My friend initially intended for the skydive to be a
surprise. However, my friend decided it might be wise to
let me get used to the idea of jumping from a plane in
advance, so that I could prepare emotionally. Entering the
words skydiving and perish on Google revealed that
approximately thirty people die every year in the United
States while skydiving. This may seem a large number at
first; however, considering the 2.5 million jumps every year,
it is in fact a small percentage. Although I had experienced
three days of stressful anticipation, having that time allowed
me to acquire knowledge regarding the threatening event.
My fear was reduced by the information I had gathered,
allowing me to enjoy the experience more.
① Height and the Fear of Skydiving
② Anticipation: A Way to Avoid Fear
③ Those Who Hesitate Lack Experiences
④ Wrong Information Puts You in Danger
⑤ Isn’t It Good to Be a Perfect Skydiver?
26. 밑줄 친 he [him]이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
A man arrived at an international airport with no luggage.
He carried only a briefcase filled with sheets of paper
covered with odd symbols and codes. The customs official
began to question ①him: Where would he be staying? He
said he was not sure. What did he have in his briefcase?
Handouts. The customs official detained him for a
considerable time before ② he was satisfied that this
traveler wasn’t up to any funny business. He just directly
told the truth with no additional facts. He did not announce,
unasked, that ③he was a professor invited to deliver a
lecture at a local university. So ④he would be staying only
one night (hence no luggage). He didn’t explain that the
sheets of paper were for his lecture on linguistics. By not
offering relevant information on his own in detail, ⑤ he gave
the impression that he was hiding something.
27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
The old-fashioned method which fish samplers use ① is
to watch fish near a dam and push a button each time a
fish swims up the ladder. They also get to measure a fish
occasionally, which involves capturing the fish in a tank that
has had the oxygen sucked out of it and holding it ② captive
until it stops moving. Once it’s still, they can put a tape
measure to it before returning it to a recuperation tank.
Finally the fish gets tagged and released back onto the
ladder to continue ③ its journey. More and more samplers
are using electrofishing, which involves pulling an electric
wire ④ attaches to a portable generator through a river.
The fish are stunned and almost magically drawn to the
wire, at which point samplers catch them in a net and take
them to a holding place for measuring and ⑤weighing
before returning them to the stream.
* recuperation: 회복
28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지
않은 것은?
Openness is important no matter what your business or
venture. The Charity Water website ① includes a Google
Map location and photographs of every well. When you look
at the site, you can see what Charity Water is doing. Many
people are ② hesitant to give to nonprofits, because they
don’t know where or how their money is actually going to
be used. This is why it can be a good idea to get
individuals or an organization to underwrite your operational
costs. This way, all the donations you collect go straight to
the people you are working to help―making your donors
feel ③ uncertain their dollars are doing good things― and
that only creates more generosity on their part. Being open
also ④ encourages you to be responsible with the money
you take in. If people are aware of where their money goes,
you’ll be ⑤ less likely to spend it on a fancy office or high
salaries.
29. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The above graph shows the percentage of American personal
debt by three major sources. ①According to the graph, in
2008 the percentage of credit card debt carried by Americans
exceeded auto debt and student debt. ②From 2008 to 2012,
however, the percentage of credit card debt decreased from
30% to 15%. ③In the same period, the rate of student debt
showed a consistent increase, while the rate of auto debt fell
annually. ④In 2012, the percentage of student debt was the
same as the sum of the other two sources. ⑤The proportion
of auto debt was the highest among the three sources in 2010,
but it ranked third, accounting for 10% in 2012.
30. Joseph B. Friedman에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는
것은?
Joseph B. Friedman was an independent American inventor
with a broad range of interests and ideas. By the age of
fourteen, he had conceptualized his first invention, the lighted
pencil, and was attempting to market his idea. Over the course
of his inventing career, he would experiment with various ideas.
He was issued nine U.S. patents and held patents in Great
Britain, Australia and Canada. His first patent was issued for
improvements to the fountain pen on April 18, 1922. This was
also the first invention that he successfully sold to Sheaffer
Pen Company in the mid 1930s. In the 1920s, Friedman began
his education in real estate. Although he was working as a real
estate agent in San Francisco, California, the 1930s proved to
be his most productive patenting period, with six of his nine
U.S. patents being issued then. One of these patents was his
most successful invention―the flexible drinking straw.
① 14살 때 첫 발명품을 구상했다.
② 9개의 미국 특허를 받았다.
③ 1920년대에 첫 번째 특허권이 팔렸다.
④ 샌프란시스코에서 부동산 중개인으로서 일했다.
⑤ 가장 성공적인 발명품은 구부러지는 빨대였다.


35. Before a person can overcome self­esteem problems and
build healthy self­esteem, it helps to know what might cause
them. Obviously, self-esteem can be hurt when someone whose
acceptance is important (like a parent or teacher) constantly
puts you down. But criticism doesn’t have to come from other
people. Self­esteem can also . Some
teens have an “inner critic,” a voice inside that seems to find
fault with everything they do. And people sometimes
unintentionally model their inner voice after a critical parent or
someone else whose opinion is important to them. Over time,
listening to a negative inner voice can harm a person’s
self-esteem just as much as if the criticism were coming
from another person. Some people get so used to their inner
critic being there that they don’t even notice when they’re
putting themselves down.
① be lowered by peer pressure
② make you feel more confident
③ be related to physical condition
④ nourish parent­child relationships
⑤ be damaged by how we see ourselves
36. There is an interesting phenomenon where people are
perceived as possessing a trait that they describe in others.
Telling others that your math professor is lazy will cause
them to infer that you are lazy. This works the other way
too― describing positive attributes about your friend may
ascribe you those attributes as well. Several experiments
showed that people will associate personality traits to
communicators mindlessly without logical rationale. They also
have a poor recollection of whether the communicator was
describing themselves or someone else in a conversation. So be
careful when gossiping about a co-worker, or you might be
seen as what you describe. And if you want to appear more
charming, perhaps you could add that word to your vocabulary
when talking about others. Furthermore, maybe it would be a
good idea to keep your negative thoughts to yourself. As the
old saying goes, “ .”

37. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
Our growing concern with health has affected the way we
eat. For the last few years, the media have warned us about
the dangers of our traditional diet, high in salt and fat, low in
fiber. The media also began to educate us about the dangers of
processed foods full of chemical additives. (A) ,
consumers began to demand healthier foods, and manufacturers
started to change some of their products. Many foods, such as
lunch meat, canned vegetables and soups, were made available
in low­fat, low sodium versions. Whole grain cereals and
higher fiber breads also began to appear on the grocery
shelves. (B) , the food industry started to produce
all-natural products―everything from potato chips to ice
cream―without additives and preservatives. Not
surprisingly, the restaurant industry responded to this
switch to healthier foods, drawing customers with salad
bars, broiled fish, and steamed vegetables.
(A) (B)
① As a result …… Moreover
② In contrast …… In addition
③ That is …… Otherwise
④ Nevertheless …… Similarly
⑤ Consequently …… Conversely

In April 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
ruled that toothpaste manufacturers weren’t adhering
closely enough to voluntary safety guidelines. As a result,
all toothpaste tubes now bear a scary­sounding warning.
(A) In the months following the new warning, toothpaste
consumer lines fielded hundreds of questions from
worried parents, and poison control centers were flooded
with calls as well. They told parents the same thing:
your child is fine and may vomit, or not.
(B) It was like this one: “Keep out of the reach of children
under 6 years of age. If more than used for brushing is
accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a
poison control center right away.”
(C) The only reason to see a doctor, however, is if the
vomiting gets so serious that dehydration becomes an
issue. That’s right: you can eat your fill of delicious
toothpaste and not come away with anything more
serious than nausea and diarrhea.

Researchers at the University of Maryland have developed
a solution to this problem by using a paper­thin layer of
wood fibers.
As we look toward a future of more renewable energy
dependency, having reliable energy storage to back up wind and
solar will be necessary for everything to run smoothly. ( ① )
Lithium-ion batteries are great for gadgets and even cars, but
on a larger scale they’re too expensive and aren’t very
environmentally friendly. ( ② ) Many researchers believe
sodium-ion batteries are the answer because sodium is cheap
and eco-friendly, but the major obstacle to advancing these
batteries has been a very short life. ( ③ ) The wood is able to
withstand the swelling and contracting of the anode and allows
the battery to survive more than 400 charge cycles. ( ④ ) At
the end of the charging cycles, the wood is wrinkled, but still
intact. ( ⑤ ) Computer models show that those wrinkles relax
the stress in the battery during charging and recharging, creating
a flexible and long-lasting battery.

Why did the proverbial Good Samaritan cross the road
for the injured stranger? Perhaps he listened to his heart.
Not in the poetic sense, but literally. A new study has
highlighted the way cardiac feedback influences people’s
decisions. Eighty­six undergraduates were asked to read a
recruitment letter seeking volunteers while they
test-drove some heart­recording equipment. Forty percent
of them who heard their heart beating fast agreed to
volunteer their time, as compared with 17 percent who
heard their heart beating at a normal speed. In the
second study, participants playing in a quick
money­sharing game simply had to decide whether to
instruct their partner to pick Option A (more profitable
for the participant him or herself) or Option B (more
profitable for the partner). The participants who heard
their heart beating fast were less likely to lie and tell
their partner that he or she would be better off choosing
Option A. * cardiac: 심장의
The two studies suggest that people tend to make a
more (A) decision when they think their heart is
(B) in terms of cardiac feedback.
(A) (B)
① collective …… relaxed
② unbiased …… normal
③ financial …… steady
④ crucial …… unstable
⑤ moral …… racing

We tell friends about our new clothing purchases and
show family members what we’re sending to the local
newspaper. This desire to share our thoughts, opinions,
and experiences is one reason social media and online
social networks have become so popular. People blog
about their preferences, post Facebook status updates
about what they ate for lunch, and tweet about why they
hate the current government. As many observers have
commented, today’s social­network­addicted people cannot
seem to stop sharing what they think, like, and want―
with everyone, all the time. Indeed, research finds that
more than 40 percent of what people talk about is their
personal experiences or personal relationships. Similarly,
around half of tweets are “me” focused, covering what
people are doing now or something that has happened to
them. Why do people talk so much about their own
attitudes and experiences?
It’s more than just vanity; we’re actually wired to find
it pleasurable. Harvard neuroscientists Jason Mitchell and
Diana Tamir found that information about
the self is intrinsically rewarding. In one study, Mitchell
and Tamir hooked subjects up to brain scanners and
asked them to share either their own opinions and
attitudes (“I like snowboarding”) or the opinions and
attitudes of another person (“He likes puppies”). They
found that sharing personal opinions activated the same
brain circuits that respond to rewards like food and
money. So talking about what you did this weekend might
feel just as good as taking a delicious bite of double
chocolate cake.

(A)
David and Mark were best buddies at school even though
they belonged to different economic strata of society.
David’s parents were doctors at the local hospital and were
very successful at their profession. Mark’s father, on the
other hand, was a mill worker at the local textile mill and
their seemingly limited resources were affecting Mark’s
mental makeup in (a) his growing years. However, both
David and Mark were the brightest students of their class
and used to compete with each other for the number one
spot. * strata: 계층
(B)
A decade later, David was appointed Senior Surgeon at
the hospital where his parents used to work and it was a
proud moment for David’s family. Sometime later, David had
to seek out expert help for a unique and complex heart
surgery case reported at his hospital. (b) His staff decided
to scout for an expert in the field and invited a doctor
from Boston who had done research on this complex
ailment.
(C)
When the doctor actually arrived, David met him. David
was astonished to see that (c) he was his dear childhood
friend, Mark. It was a very nostalgic moment. They fondly
recollected their growing up years and how they used to
compete with each other. But at this point Mark never
thought of (d) his deprived childhood and all he could relate
to David were the wonderful years they spent together.
(D)
While some years, it was Mark who stood first in the
class, in others it was David’s turn. During those years,
Mark would never reflect his poverty with David though
internally sometimes, (e) he questioned his ill fate. They
separated at the end of school, moved on to colleges in
different cities and lost touch with each other.
