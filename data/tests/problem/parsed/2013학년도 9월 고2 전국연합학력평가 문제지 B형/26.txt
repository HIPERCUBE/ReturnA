26. 밑줄 친 he [him]이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
A man arrived at an international airport with no luggage.
He carried only a briefcase filled with sheets of paper
covered with odd symbols and codes. The customs official
began to question ①him: Where would he be staying? He
said he was not sure. What did he have in his briefcase?
Handouts. The customs official detained him for a
considerable time before ② he was satisfied that this
traveler wasn’t up to any funny business. He just directly
told the truth with no additional facts. He did not announce,
unasked, that ③he was a professor invited to deliver a
lecture at a local university. So ④he would be staying only
one night (hence no luggage). He didn’t explain that the
sheets of paper were for his lecture on linguistics. By not
offering relevant information on his own in detail, ⑤ he gave
the impression that he was hiding something.
