34. Have you ever noticed that you sometimes lean forward
when someone you’re talking with leans forward? The
Chameleon Effect is the unintentional physical and verbal
mirroring between people who are getting along well. People
may mimic each others’ body posture, hand gestures, speaking
accents, and other behaviors when they are in rapport. The
body is actually autonomously making the interaction
smoother and increasing the level of liking while
communicating. The experiment conducted by Tanya
Chartrand and her colleague showed that mimicry facilitated
the smoothness of interactions and increased liking between
interaction partners. Experimenters saw an increase in a
subject’s behavior, such as shaking their foot, when they
shook their foot during an interaction. When experimenters
intentionally copied the mannerisms of a subject, the subject
reported . Empathic individuals, those
who took the perspective of others, were also found to mirror
another person’s action more often. [3점]
