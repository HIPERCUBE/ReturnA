A few years ago, I received a surprise birthday present
from a friend― a tandem skydive. Falling through the sky
fifteen thousand feet from the ground was never on my
wish list. All the same, that was exactly what I was about
to do. My friend initially intended for the skydive to be a
surprise. However, my friend decided it might be wise to
let me get used to the idea of jumping from a plane in
advance, so that I could prepare emotionally. Entering the
words skydiving and perish on Google revealed that
approximately thirty people die every year in the United
States while skydiving. This may seem a large number at
first; however, considering the 2.5 million jumps every year,
it is in fact a small percentage. Although I had experienced
three days of stressful anticipation, having that time allowed
me to acquire knowledge regarding the threatening event.
My fear was reduced by the information I had gathered,
allowing me to enjoy the experience more.
