The old-fashioned method which fish samplers use ① is
to watch fish near a dam and push a button each time a
fish swims up the ladder. They also get to measure a fish
occasionally, which involves capturing the fish in a tank that
has had the oxygen sucked out of it and holding it ② captive
until it stops moving. Once it’s still, they can put a tape
measure to it before returning it to a recuperation tank.
Finally the fish gets tagged and released back onto the
ladder to continue ③ its journey. More and more samplers
are using electrofishing, which involves pulling an electric
wire ④ attaches to a portable generator through a river.
The fish are stunned and almost magically drawn to the
wire, at which point samplers catch them in a net and take
them to a holding place for measuring and ⑤weighing
before returning them to the stream.
