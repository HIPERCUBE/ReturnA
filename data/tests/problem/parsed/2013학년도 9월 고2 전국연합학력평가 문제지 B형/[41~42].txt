We tell friends about our new clothing purchases and
show family members what we’re sending to the local
newspaper. This desire to share our thoughts, opinions,
and experiences is one reason social media and online
social networks have become so popular. People blog
about their preferences, post Facebook status updates
about what they ate for lunch, and tweet about why they
hate the current government. As many observers have
commented, today’s social­network­addicted people cannot
seem to stop sharing what they think, like, and want―
with everyone, all the time. Indeed, research finds that
more than 40 percent of what people talk about is their
personal experiences or personal relationships. Similarly,
around half of tweets are “me” focused, covering what
people are doing now or something that has happened to
them. Why do people talk so much about their own
attitudes and experiences?
It’s more than just vanity; we’re actually wired to find
it pleasurable. Harvard neuroscientists Jason Mitchell and
Diana Tamir found that information about
the self is intrinsically rewarding. In one study, Mitchell
and Tamir hooked subjects up to brain scanners and
asked them to share either their own opinions and
attitudes (“I like snowboarding”) or the opinions and
attitudes of another person (“He likes puppies”). They
found that sharing personal opinions activated the same
brain circuits that respond to rewards like food and
money. So talking about what you did this weekend might
feel just as good as taking a delicious bite of double
chocolate cake.
