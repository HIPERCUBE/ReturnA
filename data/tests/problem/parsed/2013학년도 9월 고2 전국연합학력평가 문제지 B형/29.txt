The above graph shows the percentage of American personal
debt by three major sources. ①According to the graph, in
2008 the percentage of credit card debt carried by Americans
exceeded auto debt and student debt. ②From 2008 to 2012,
however, the percentage of credit card debt decreased from
30% to 15%. ③In the same period, the rate of student debt
showed a consistent increase, while the rate of auto debt fell
annually. ④In 2012, the percentage of student debt was the
same as the sum of the other two sources. ⑤The proportion
of auto debt was the highest among the three sources in 2010,
but it ranked third, accounting for 10% in 2012.
