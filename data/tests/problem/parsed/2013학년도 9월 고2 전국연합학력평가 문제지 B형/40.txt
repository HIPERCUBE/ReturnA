Why did the proverbial Good Samaritan cross the road
for the injured stranger? Perhaps he listened to his heart.
Not in the poetic sense, but literally. A new study has
highlighted the way cardiac feedback influences people’s
decisions. Eighty­six undergraduates were asked to read a
recruitment letter seeking volunteers while they
test-drove some heart­recording equipment. Forty percent
of them who heard their heart beating fast agreed to
volunteer their time, as compared with 17 percent who
heard their heart beating at a normal speed. In the
second study, participants playing in a quick
money­sharing game simply had to decide whether to
instruct their partner to pick Option A (more profitable
for the participant him or herself) or Option B (more
profitable for the partner). The participants who heard
their heart beating fast were less likely to lie and tell
their partner that he or she would be better off choosing
Option A. * cardiac: 심장의

more (A) decision when they think their heart is
