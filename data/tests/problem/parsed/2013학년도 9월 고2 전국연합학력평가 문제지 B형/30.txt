Joseph B. Friedman was an independent American inventor
with a broad range of interests and ideas. By the age of
fourteen, he had conceptualized his first invention, the lighted
pencil, and was attempting to market his idea. Over the course
of his inventing career, he would experiment with various ideas.
He was issued nine U.S. patents and held patents in Great
Britain, Australia and Canada. His first patent was issued for
improvements to the fountain pen on April 18, 1922. This was
also the first invention that he successfully sold to Sheaffer
Pen Company in the mid 1930s. In the 1920s, Friedman began
his education in real estate. Although he was working as a real
estate agent in San Francisco, California, the 1930s proved to
be his most productive patenting period, with six of his nine
U.S. patents being issued then. One of these patents was his
most successful invention―the flexible drinking straw.
