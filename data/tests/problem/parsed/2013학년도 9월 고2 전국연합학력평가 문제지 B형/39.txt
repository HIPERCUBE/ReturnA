Researchers at the University of Maryland have developed
a solution to this problem by using a paper­thin layer of
wood fibers.
As we look toward a future of more renewable energy
dependency, having reliable energy storage to back up wind and
solar will be necessary for everything to run smoothly. ( ① )
Lithium-ion batteries are great for gadgets and even cars, but
on a larger scale they’re too expensive and aren’t very
environmentally friendly. ( ② ) Many researchers believe
sodium-ion batteries are the answer because sodium is cheap
and eco-friendly, but the major obstacle to advancing these
batteries has been a very short life. ( ③ ) The wood is able to
withstand the swelling and contracting of the anode and allows
the battery to survive more than 400 charge cycles. ( ④ ) At
the end of the charging cycles, the wood is wrinkled, but still
intact. ( ⑤ ) Computer models show that those wrinkles relax
the stress in the battery during charging and recharging, creating
a flexible and long-lasting battery.
