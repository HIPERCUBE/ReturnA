Leaders and managers used to be told to keep a stiff
upper lip and not show emotion, to remove emotion from
the situation at hand and just deal with the facts. Despite
all your efforts to mask emotions, they will come out in
some form and people have an innate ability to pick up on
this. Emotions are always at play, so we need to reframe
the role that emotions play in the workplace. We need to
view emotions as the fuel that drives the engine of
productivity and innovation. The reality is that you will
never separate emotions from your workplace. Individuals
who are good at dealing with the tough stuff are those who
have learned, and even mastered, the art of managing
emotions. So, instead of spending time in trying to push
aside or suppress emotions, it is far better to learn how to
manage them well.
