32. People make purchasing decisions by choosing between
alternatives or by rejecting certain options. But a new study
in the Journal of Consumer Research finds that focusing on
rejecting an option can lead consumers to their
preferences. Why does this happen? When consumers reject
options, they need to decide which alternative they do not
want, so they focus on options that are less preferred in
order to assess if they should reject those options. This
shift of focus makes them more likely to notice appealing
features of the initially less preferred option. For example, a
newly married couple who prefers an apartment closer to
the subway station because of easy access to it, but doesn’t
have enough money, was told to select an apartment to
‘reject’: an apartment closer to the subway station or a less
expensive one farther from the station. Simply instructing
them to decide which one they would like to ‘reject’ makes
them more likely to choose the less expensive apartment as
their place to live in. Similarly, those who said they would
prefer a less-expensive apartment selected the apartment
close to the station. [3점]
