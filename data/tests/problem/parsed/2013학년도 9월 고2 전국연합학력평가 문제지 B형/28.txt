Openness is important no matter what your business or
venture. The Charity Water website ① includes a Google
Map location and photographs of every well. When you look
at the site, you can see what Charity Water is doing. Many
people are ② hesitant to give to nonprofits, because they
don’t know where or how their money is actually going to
be used. This is why it can be a good idea to get
individuals or an organization to underwrite your operational
costs. This way, all the donations you collect go straight to
the people you are working to help―making your donors

that only creates more generosity on their part. Being open

you take in. If people are aware of where their money goes,
you’ll be ⑤ less likely to spend it on a fancy office or high
salaries.
