34. In my economics classes, about 15 percent of my students
get A’s, and about 15 percent fail the class. I could
announce that no matter what their performance, everyone
will receive the same grade: A. I would expect a huge drop
in the effort and therefore in the efficiency of the whole
learning process. Alternatively, I could announce that
students in the bottom 50 percent of the class will fail, and
only the top 5 percent will get an A. Would I get more
effort? Some individuals― those on the edge of those
extreme alternatives―would probably hustle. But a lot of
others would drop out or give up. Not enough competitive
pressure may result in students becoming lazy. But too much
may encourage them to become obsessed with test
performance at the cost of developing their capabilities for
learning.
