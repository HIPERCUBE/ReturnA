39. Wilt never needed― or even wanted― a high school
education. But when he tried to get a part­time job after
retirement, he couldn’t because he didn’t have a high school
diploma. And that annoyed him. He set out to get his
General Education Diploma (GED), which certifies high
school­level academic competence. Month after month, year
after year, he took the GED tests. He’d fail them, and study
harder, only to fail each of them repeatedly for eight years.
“He had amazing persistence― to have that goal and not let
loose of it,” recalled his tutor. Since it was such a tough
road for him, Wilt is still saving the special message on his
answering machine. “I was your proctor for the GED exam. I
just called to congratulate you. You passed both of the
tests,” said the voice.
