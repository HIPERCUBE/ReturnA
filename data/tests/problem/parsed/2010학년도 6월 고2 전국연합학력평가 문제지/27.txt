27. Sigmund Freud was greatly impressed by the principle of
energy conservation, which states that energy may be
changed into different forms but is neither created nor
destroyed. He believed that humans are like closed systems.
Each human possesses a constant amount of psychic energy.
One corollary of this principle is that if a forbidden act or
impulse is suppressed, its energy will seek an outlet
somewhere else in the system, possibly .
Aggressive impulses, for example, may be displaced to
racing sports cars, playing chess, or to a sarcastic sense of
humor. Dreams are also expressions of psychic energy that
has been blocked from surfacing. [3점]
