When an incident wave hits an obstacle, for example when a
water wave hits a sea wall, it bounces back. This is called
reflection. In <Fig.1>, the wave is reflected back at an angle
① equal to its angle of approach. It is then called a reflected
wave. The shape of a reflected wave depends both on the
shape of the incident wave and the shape of the ② obstacle it
hits. The other figures above show what happens when
straight and curved incident waves hit differently shaped
obstacles. First, as in < Fig.2 >, straight waves hitting a
straight barrier produce ③ straight reflected waves. Then, as
in < Fig.3 >, circular waves hitting a ④ curved barrier
produce circular reflected waves. Finally, < Fig.4 > shows
that ⑤ circular waves hitting an inward­curving barrier
produce straight reflected waves.
