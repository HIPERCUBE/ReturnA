Now the landscape was changing. The road was narrower
and bumpy. It was suddenly harder to balance on the bike
as the front wheel wobbled over stones. John fell when the
bike stopped against a rock. He grabbed instinctively for
Paul; the new child, tied tightly to his seat, was uninjured,
only alarmed when the bike fell to its side. But John’s ankle
was twisted, and his knees were scraped, blood seeping
through his torn trousers. Painfully, he righted himself and
the bike, and reassured Paul. Being chased by the searchers,
he couldn’t help but keep riding his bike into the unfamiliar
landscape holding hidden, unknown dangers.
