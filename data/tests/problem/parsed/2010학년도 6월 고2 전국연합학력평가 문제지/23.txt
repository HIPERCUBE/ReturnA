Most snakes move by gently curving their ribs, causing
waves of movement to pass from head to tail. ①The
characteristic “S” curve occurs as the snake alternately
tightens muscles on one side of the body and relaxes those
on the opposite side. ②The combination of these forward
and sideways movements, transferred to the belly scales,
moves the snake forward. ③ For instance, the sidewinder
rattlesnake uses a distinctive sideways motion to cross the
sand, touching the ground with its scales at two points and
pushing the rest of its body sideways. ④The species is
active mainly at night during hot months and in the daytime
during the cooler months of its activity period. ⑤The
snake’s sideways motion leaves rows of parallel tracks along
its path.
