33. Sports’ economic power is now well established, global and
growing. Many cities make huge efforts when bidding to
stage major sporting events, not just for their commercial
worth but for the long­term social benefits that are the
legacy of such events. But this isn’t only a question of
economics. Sports also have enduring qualities. They show
us how to participate in something bigger than ourselves,
and teach us how to demonstrate respect for teammates and
opponents. They help us learn how to win with humility and
lose with grace; how to set a goal and fulfill it. Sports bring
people together; the self­worth and self­belief that they
teach are values that can last a lifetime.
