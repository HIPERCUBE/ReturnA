19. 밑줄 친 they[their]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
It is one thing to talk about the problems of the world and
quite another to actually try to change things. As a couple,
actors Alex and Donna have served as goodwill ambassadors
worldwide. First, ① they brought help to countries where
natural disasters killed tens of thousands of people and left
millions homeless. In underdeveloped countries, ② they have
tended to the poor and sick and raised global awareness for
victims of atrocities. The couple care for four adopted
children from different countries, in addition to ③ their
biological children. There are a number of people who could
be honored for ④ their good works. But I’ve seen Alex and
Donna firsthand, and ⑤ their humanitarian commitment is
truly impressive.
