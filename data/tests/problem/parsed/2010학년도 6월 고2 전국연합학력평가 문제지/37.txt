Method acting, a technique used by actors, is thought to
have revolutionized acting as we know it today. It uses
techniques such as sense and memory to achieve realism in
acting. A Russian theater director named Stanislavski wrote
books on the subject of Method acting in the 1930s. In the
1940s and 50s, Method acting was popularized and taught at
the legendary Actors’ Studio in New York City. Method
acting is thought to be one of the most difficult techniques
to learn; there are no technical forms or lessons that can be
practiced to learn it. There are numerous versions of the
Method, taught by different teachers. The initial approach
was to recall a past experience and immerse oneself in the
emotion of that experience so as to apply it to the scene
presently being undertaken.
