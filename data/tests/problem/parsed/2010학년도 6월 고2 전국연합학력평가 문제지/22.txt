Imagine a school of fish weaving through a network of
pipelines at the bottom of a bay. Only instead of ① live fish
searching for food, these are robots patrolling for pipe
damage and pollutant leaks. Robo­fish can fit in places
divers and submarines can’t. The newest ② are five to
eighteen inches long, have about ten parts, and cost just
hundreds of dollars. These robots made of a synthetic
compound ③ designed to be flexible in the tail and rigid in
the midsection. The motion of the material mimics the
swimming motion of a real fish. Although the latest robotic
fish are pretty close to ④making a splash, they are not
yet swimming in lakes and oceans. It’ll be a few more
years ⑤ before you can tell the story of the robo­fish that
got away.
