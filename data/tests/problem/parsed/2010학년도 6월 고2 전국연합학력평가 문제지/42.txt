42. Many art historians will tell you that Romanticism slips
through your fingers when you try to grasp it. That’s partly
because Romantic artists didn’t have one style like the
Impressionists or Expressionists. The movement was about
intense personal expression, so artists could focus on
whatever turned them on. In addition, the movement wasn’t
grounded in France or Italy. It spread across most of Europe
and later to the United States. Romanticism wasn’t merely a
visual­arts movement― it included poetry, fiction, and music.
There were even Romantic philosophers! After all, the fact
that Romanticism was so widespread and diverse makes it
hard to squeeze it into one single sentence.
