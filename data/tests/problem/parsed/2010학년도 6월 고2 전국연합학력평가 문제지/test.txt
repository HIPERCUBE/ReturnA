18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
This is an expression used to show concern for the
feelings of others. In everyday usage this describes behavior
which is somewhat formal and distancing. This may be
expressed both verbally and non‑verbally. Behavior such as
opening a door for another, avoiding telephoning a colleague
early on a Sunday morning, apologizing for interrupting a
speaker, or using courtesy titles like sir and madam could
all be considered expressions of this. In addition, since this
is culturally bound, appropriate ways to express this will
vary in different cultures.
① greeting ② tolerance ③ politeness
④ forgiveness ⑤ conversation
19. 밑줄 친 they[their]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
It is one thing to talk about the problems of the world and
quite another to actually try to change things. As a couple,
actors Alex and Donna have served as goodwill ambassadors
worldwide. First, ① they brought help to countries where
natural disasters killed tens of thousands of people and left
millions homeless. In underdeveloped countries, ② they have
tended to the poor and sick and raised global awareness for
victims of atrocities. The couple care for four adopted
children from different countries, in addition to ③ their
biological children. There are a number of people who could
be honored for ④ their good works. But I’ve seen Alex and
Donna firsthand, and ⑤ their humanitarian commitment is
truly impressive.

We spend an excessive amount of time browsing the Web every
day. As a company’s executive put it, “Many users probably spend
more time on the Internet than they (A) do / are in their
cars.” Yet many of us barely notice what browser we’re

Imagine a school of fish weaving through a network of
pipelines at the bottom of a bay. Only instead of ① live fish
searching for food, these are robots patrolling for pipe
damage and pollutant leaks. Robo­fish can fit in places
divers and submarines can’t. The newest ② are five to
eighteen inches long, have about ten parts, and cost just
hundreds of dollars. These robots made of a synthetic
compound ③ designed to be flexible in the tail and rigid in
the midsection. The motion of the material mimics the
swimming motion of a real fish. Although the latest robotic
fish are pretty close to ④making a splash, they are not
yet swimming in lakes and oceans. It’ll be a few more
years ⑤ before you can tell the story of the robo­fish that
got away.
23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Most snakes move by gently curving their ribs, causing
waves of movement to pass from head to tail. ①The
characteristic “S” curve occurs as the snake alternately
tightens muscles on one side of the body and relaxes those
on the opposite side. ②The combination of these forward
and sideways movements, transferred to the belly scales,
moves the snake forward. ③ For instance, the sidewinder
rattlesnake uses a distinctive sideways motion to cross the
sand, touching the ground with its scales at two points and
pushing the rest of its body sideways. ④The species is
active mainly at night during hot months and in the daytime
during the cooler months of its activity period. ⑤The
snake’s sideways motion leaves rows of parallel tracks along
its path.

24. As soon as we are born, the world gets to work on us
and transforms us from merely biological into social units.
Every human being at every stage of history or pre­history
is born into a society and from his earliest years is formed
by that society. The language which he speaks, for example,
is not an individual inheritance, but a social acquisition from
the group in which he grows up. Both language and
environment help to determine the character of his thought;
his earliest ideas come to him from others. As has been
well said, society and the individual cannot be .
① changed ② balanced ③ separated
④ influenced ⑤ destroyed
25. The most popular modern building in Beijing these days is
not the “Bird’s Nest” National Stadium built for the 2008
Summer Olympics. According to a recent survey of Beijing
citizens, the most popular contemporary structure in the
Chinese capital today is actually an old symbol of industrial
development: the railway station called Beijing South. It is
spacious enough to fit a jumbo jet between the columns that
support the central hall. And it is made to accommodate
China­size crowds increasingly lured by the comfort and
efficiency of high­speed rail travel. By 2030 the station is
expected to handle 105 million passengers a year, 50
percent more than the total for Heathrow, one of the world’s
busiest international airports. After a half century of decline,
the train station is .
① back in fashion ② pushed into a corner
③ struggling hard to survive ④ on the brink of bankruptcy
⑤ a sign of economic recession
26. In America, steroids are increasingly being used by
teenage boys for cosmetic reasons. It is steroids’ ability to
promote muscle growth, increase lean body mass, and
decrease body fat that attracts teenagers to take them.
Those striving to improve their strength, speed, and stamina
often see steroids as a quick means to pushing heavier
weights and looking better. But a body enhanced by drugs is
a dangerous bargain. Steroids can upset hormonal production
and damage the heart and kidneys. Just as worrisome is
. Users of steroids are likely
to show frequent mood changes, including uncontrolled anger
and extreme irritability.
① the threat to mental health
② the loss of intellectual power
③ the sudden decrease in drug use
④ the government’s control on steroids
⑤ the exaggeration of their side effects
27. Sigmund Freud was greatly impressed by the principle of
energy conservation, which states that energy may be
changed into different forms but is neither created nor
destroyed. He believed that humans are like closed systems.
Each human possesses a constant amount of psychic energy.
One corollary of this principle is that if a forbidden act or
impulse is suppressed, its energy will seek an outlet
somewhere else in the system, possibly .
Aggressive impulses, for example, may be displaced to
racing sports cars, playing chess, or to a sarcastic sense of
humor. Dreams are also expressions of psychic energy that
has been blocked from surfacing. [3점]
* corollary: 추론
① responding to the past
② following its directions
③ lowering our expectations
④ reinforcing moral behaviors
⑤ appearing in disguised form
28. People hate losses. Losing something makes you twice as
miserable as gaining the same thing makes you happy. Such
a tendency to avoid losses helps produce a strong desire to
. If you are reluctant to give up what
you have because you do not want to suffer losses, then
you will turn down trades you might have otherwise made.
In an experiment, half the students in a class received
coffee mugs and the other half got large chocolate bars. The
mugs and the chocolate cost about the same, and in pretests
students were as likely to choose one as the other. Yet
when offered the opportunity to switch from a mug to a
chocolate bar or vice versa, only one in ten switched.
① stick with your current holding
② overcome your failure in the trade
③ exchange what you have with others
④ buy chocolate bars and mugs together
⑤ participate in psychological experiments

Now the landscape was changing. The road was narrower
and bumpy. It was suddenly harder to balance on the bike
as the front wheel wobbled over stones. John fell when the
bike stopped against a rock. He grabbed instinctively for
Paul; the new child, tied tightly to his seat, was uninjured,
only alarmed when the bike fell to its side. But John’s ankle
was twisted, and his knees were scraped, blood seeping
through his torn trousers. Painfully, he righted himself and
the bike, and reassured Paul. Being chased by the searchers,
he couldn’t help but keep riding his bike into the unfamiliar
landscape holding hidden, unknown dangers.
* wobble: 비틀거리다
① busy and noisy ② tense and urgent
③ exciting and festive ④ pastoral and peaceful
⑤ monotonous and boring

When an incident wave hits an obstacle, for example when a
water wave hits a sea wall, it bounces back. This is called
reflection. In <Fig.1>, the wave is reflected back at an angle
① equal to its angle of approach. It is then called a reflected
wave. The shape of a reflected wave depends both on the
shape of the incident wave and the shape of the ② obstacle it
hits. The other figures above show what happens when
straight and curved incident waves hit differently shaped
obstacles. First, as in < Fig.2 >, straight waves hitting a
straight barrier produce ③ straight reflected waves. Then, as
in < Fig.3 >, circular waves hitting a ④ curved barrier
produce circular reflected waves. Finally, < Fig.4 > shows
that ⑤ circular waves hitting an inward­curving barrier
produce straight reflected waves.

At match point in the final game of the racquetball
tournament, Gonzolas made a “kill shot” to win the
tournament. The referee called it a success. But after a
moment’s hesitation, Gonzolas (A) declared / denied that
his shot had hit the wrong place first. As a result, the serve
went to his opponent, who went on to win the match. A
leading racquetball magazine called for an explanation of the

racquetball circuit. Who could ever imagine it in any sport?
Here was a player with everything officially in his favor,

Jealousy is one of those unnecessary evils we burden
ourselves with. None of us could honestly say that we have
not ever been jealous of more fortunate and superior ones.
(A) , jealousy is generally found among equals or
near equals like friends of equal social status, colleagues in
the office and relatives. We are not jealous of someone who
is either too highly placed or too distantly connected with
us. Jealousy keeps us under a sense of frustration and
disappointment. It is such a depressing feeling that we
cannot tell about it to even our best friends nor can we
contain it within ourselves. (B) , it leaves us with
an inconvenience of an unusual misery and if not controlled,
it works like a slow poison to our healthy nature.
(A) (B)

② In other words …… Nevertheless
③ However …… Otherwise

33. Sports’ economic power is now well established, global and
growing. Many cities make huge efforts when bidding to
stage major sporting events, not just for their commercial
worth but for the long­term social benefits that are the
legacy of such events. But this isn’t only a question of
economics. Sports also have enduring qualities. They show
us how to participate in something bigger than ourselves,
and teach us how to demonstrate respect for teammates and
opponents. They help us learn how to win with humility and
lose with grace; how to set a goal and fulfill it. Sports bring
people together; the self­worth and self­belief that they
teach are values that can last a lifetime.

34. In my economics classes, about 15 percent of my students
get A’s, and about 15 percent fail the class. I could
announce that no matter what their performance, everyone
will receive the same grade: A. I would expect a huge drop
in the effort and therefore in the efficiency of the whole
learning process. Alternatively, I could announce that
students in the bottom 50 percent of the class will fail, and
only the top 5 percent will get an A. Would I get more
effort? Some individuals― those on the edge of those
extreme alternatives―would probably hustle. But a lot of
others would drop out or give up. Not enough competitive
pressure may result in students becoming lazy. But too much
may encourage them to become obsessed with test
performance at the cost of developing their capabilities for
learning.
① the traits of successful learners
② the benefits of economics classes
③ the gap between ability and performance
④ the effects of teachers’ positive thinking
⑤ the influence of grading on learners’ attitudes

The above graph shows the prevalence of
undernourishment and the average school attainment by
region in 2000. ① Sub­Saharan Africans completed 3.5
years of school while over 30% of them were
undernourished. ② The percentage of undernourishment in
South Asia was around 22% and the people in the region
completed more than 5 years of school. ③ The percentage
of undernourishment in the Near East was the same as that
in the Caribbean. ④ People in the Caribbean completed
about half a school year longer than those in the Near
East. ⑤ The undernourishment percentage of East Asia was
about one third that of Sub­Saharan Africa, but East Asia
had the longest school years among the regions.
36. Lost objects에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
According to a study conducted by an opinion research
institute, ninety percent of all people regularly have to
search for lost objects. The item people search for most is
keys. Ballpoint pens take second place on the list of missing
things. Third come eyeglasses, while purses take fourth
place. The object most commonly lost by people over 50 is
glasses. There are no great differences between men and
women. Women have a bit more trouble finding their purses,
but they look after their keys a little better than men. In
any case, it’s a waste of time and has a negative effect on
our moods if we create stress by searching for lost objects.
Forgetfulness with small things is not some unchangeable
natural phenomenon.

37. Method acting에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Method acting, a technique used by actors, is thought to
have revolutionized acting as we know it today. It uses
techniques such as sense and memory to achieve realism in
acting. A Russian theater director named Stanislavski wrote
books on the subject of Method acting in the 1930s. In the
1940s and 50s, Method acting was popularized and taught at
the legendary Actors’ Studio in New York City. Method
acting is thought to be one of the most difficult techniques
to learn; there are no technical forms or lessons that can be
practiced to learn it. There are numerous versions of the
Method, taught by different teachers. The initial approach
was to recall a past experience and immerse oneself in the
emotion of that experience so as to apply it to the scene
presently being undertaken.
① 연기에서 리얼리즘을 구현하고자 한다.
② 러시아의 한 연출가가 쓴 책의 주제였다.
③ 1940～50년대에 뉴욕의 한 유명한 스튜디오에서 가르쳐졌다.

38. Have you ever been corrected by someone and said to the
person trying to correct you, “Thank you so much for
showing me that I’m wrong and you’re right. Now I see it.
Boy, you’re great!”? Or, has anyone thanked you for
correcting them, stating that you are “right” at their
expense? Of course not. The truth is that all of us hate to
be corrected. We all want our positions to be respected and
understood by others. Being listened to and heard is one of
the greatest desires of the human heart.

39. Wilt never needed― or even wanted― a high school
education. But when he tried to get a part­time job after
retirement, he couldn’t because he didn’t have a high school
diploma. And that annoyed him. He set out to get his
General Education Diploma (GED), which certifies high
school­level academic competence. Month after month, year
after year, he took the GED tests. He’d fail them, and study
harder, only to fail each of them repeatedly for eight years.
“He had amazing persistence― to have that goal and not let
loose of it,” recalled his tutor. Since it was such a tough
road for him, Wilt is still saving the special message on his
answering machine. “I was your proctor for the GED exam. I
just called to congratulate you. You passed both of the
tests,” said the voice.

From that report, a mapmaker drew in a long line of
mountains.
Ignorance about the African continent has led to some
enormous errors in mapmaking. ( ① ) One of the errors
happened in the 1700s, when a European explorer reported
having seen mountains in southern Mali. ( ② ) As a result,
these “Kong Mountains,” as he called them, were drawn on
almost all maps of Africa in the 19th century, and they
seemed to be an important feature of the continental
geography. ( ③ ) European politicians and traders made
decisions based on their belief in the existence of these
mountains. ( ④ ) However, in the late 1880s, a French
explorer proved that there were no mountains in that part of
Africa. ( ⑤ ) Following that discovery, the “Kong
Mountains” disappeared from maps of Africa.

41. Without exception, all good presenters have one thing in
common, enthusiasm, both for their subject and for the
business of presenting it. Enthusiasm is infectious.
Audiences can’t help but be affected by it. And the best
public speakers always make what they say sound as if it
really matters. They know that if it matters to them, it will
matter to their audience. Many things contribute to the
success of a presentation― new and unusual content, a clear
structure, a good sense of timing, imaginative use of visual
aids, and the ability to make people laugh and think. But
above and beyond all of these is enthusiasm.
① Individual Style Counts
② Present Your Ideas Clearly
③ The Goal of Public Speaking
④ Understanding Your Audience
⑤ The Key to Good Presentations
42. Many art historians will tell you that Romanticism slips
through your fingers when you try to grasp it. That’s partly
because Romantic artists didn’t have one style like the
Impressionists or Expressionists. The movement was about
intense personal expression, so artists could focus on
whatever turned them on. In addition, the movement wasn’t
grounded in France or Italy. It spread across most of Europe
and later to the United States. Romanticism wasn’t merely a
visual­arts movement― it included poetry, fiction, and music.
There were even Romantic philosophers! After all, the fact
that Romanticism was so widespread and diverse makes it
hard to squeeze it into one single sentence.
① Difficulty of Defining Romanticism
② Various Viewpoints on Impressionists
③ Differences between European and American Artists
④ Diverse Styles of Romantic Philosophers
⑤ Modern Art Movements in Europe

There are many units by which to measure the impact of
climate change: degrees of increasing temperature, feet of
rising sea level, dollars needed to adapt to a warming
world.
(A) As global temperatures rise over the next century, these
scientists argue, Earth’s habitable climatic zones will start
moving too, generally away from the Equator and toward
the poles.
(B) That means many species of plants and animals will also
have to move in order to survive. Whether or not they do
will depend on how fast a species can adjust its habitat
range, and how quickly that range moves out from under
it.
(C) But a group of scientists have put forth an intriguing new
unit of measurement: kilometers per year. In an article
published in Nature, scientists describe what they call the
speed of Earth’s shifting climatic zones.

Sit still! Be quiet! These are the great watchwords of
school. If an enemy spy from outer space were planning to
take over Earth, and if his strategy were to prepare mankind
for this takeover by making children as stupid as possible,
he could find no better way to do it than to require them,
for many hours a day, to be still and quiet. It is absolutely
guaranteed to work. Children live all of a piece. Their
bodies, their muscles, their voices, and their brains are all
hooked together. Turn off a part of them, and you turn them
off altogether.

When ‘a fool in the shower’ realizes that the water is too
cold, he turns on the hot water. However, the hot water
takes a while to arrive, so the fool simply turns the hot
water up all the way, eventually burning himself. ‘A fool in
the shower’ is a phrase coined by Milton Freidman, a Nobel
Prize­winning economist, who described the idea that
changes or policies planned to alter the course of the
economy should be done slowly, rather than all at once,
because it takes time to determine the effects of those
changes. That is, any change made to stimulate a broad
economy, especially one as large as the U.S. takes time to
work its way through. For example, a central bank’s move
like lowering the federal fund rate usually takes about six
months to fully integrate into the economy.
Since the effects of any economic policy change may not be

on them.

(A) Natalie’s interest in writing was sparked by accident
back in September on the bus with her mom. She had been
a 6th grader for three weeks now and both (a) she and her
mom had already settled into their routine of commuting
together. It was a Friday afternoon, and they were going
home on the 5:55 coach, thundering through from New York
City to Hoboken, New Jersey.
(B) Natalie asked, “How come?” When (b) her dad died,
Natalie had decided she needed to talk to her mom more.
Sometimes (c) she pretended to be interested in her mom’s
work at the publishing company even when she wasn’t. Like
now. Her mom said, “Well, the marketing people keep track
of what kinds of books kids and parents and teachers are
buying. Then they tell us, and we’re supposed to make
more books like the ones they think people will buy. They
want us to publish more adventure books, more series
books, and more school stories.”
(C) Her mom looked exhausted. Natalie studied (d) her
face on the headrest. It was a pretty face― Prettier than
mine, she thought. But there were little lines at the corners
of her mother’s eyes and mouth. Care lines, worry lines.
Natalie asked, “Hard day, Mom?” Eyes still closed, her mom
smiled and nodded. “The editorial department met all day
with the marketing department― all day.”
(D) Then (e) she asked, “What’s a school story?” Her
mom said, “A school story is just what it sounds like― it’s
a short novel about kids and stuff that happens mostly at
school. Then Natalie said to herself, Hey, who knows more
about school than someone who’s right there, five days a
week, nine months a year? I bet I could write a school
story. And that was all it took. Natalie Nelson the novelist
was born.

Every night at 11 p.m., one village is thrown into total
darkness. Strapped for cash for the past few years, the
local council has taken to switching off all the streetlights
at night. But while the plan saves money, it has left some
residents worrying about their children coming home in the
dark. So one villager contacted the local utility company
and offered a solution: turning on the village lights with
. A few months later, the company
developed a special modem and software, Dial4Light.
The residents can now switch on the lights on a specific
street whenever they like. All they have to do is to
register for the plan online and provide their phone
number. Each time they need to light a street, they can
call the Dial4Light number. Within seconds, the lights are
on, and they can walk safely. The project last year proved
a big hit with the public. Therefore, the council decided to
carry out the plan for the entire surrounding villages
because the system could work in villages where residents
don’t need streetlights burning all night.
