(A) Natalie’s interest in writing was sparked by accident
back in September on the bus with her mom. She had been
a 6th grader for three weeks now and both (a) she and her
mom had already settled into their routine of commuting
together. It was a Friday afternoon, and they were going
home on the 5:55 coach, thundering through from New York
City to Hoboken, New Jersey.
(B) Natalie asked, “How come?” When (b) her dad died,
Natalie had decided she needed to talk to her mom more.
Sometimes (c) she pretended to be interested in her mom’s
work at the publishing company even when she wasn’t. Like
now. Her mom said, “Well, the marketing people keep track
of what kinds of books kids and parents and teachers are
buying. Then they tell us, and we’re supposed to make
more books like the ones they think people will buy. They
want us to publish more adventure books, more series
books, and more school stories.”
(C) Her mom looked exhausted. Natalie studied (d) her
face on the headrest. It was a pretty face― Prettier than
mine, she thought. But there were little lines at the corners
of her mother’s eyes and mouth. Care lines, worry lines.
Natalie asked, “Hard day, Mom?” Eyes still closed, her mom
smiled and nodded. “The editorial department met all day
with the marketing department― all day.”
(D) Then (e) she asked, “What’s a school story?” Her
mom said, “A school story is just what it sounds like― it’s
a short novel about kids and stuff that happens mostly at
school. Then Natalie said to herself, Hey, who knows more
about school than someone who’s right there, five days a
week, nine months a year? I bet I could write a school
story. And that was all it took. Natalie Nelson the novelist
was born.
