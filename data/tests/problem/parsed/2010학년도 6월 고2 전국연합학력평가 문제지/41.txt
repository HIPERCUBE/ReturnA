41. Without exception, all good presenters have one thing in
common, enthusiasm, both for their subject and for the
business of presenting it. Enthusiasm is infectious.
Audiences can’t help but be affected by it. And the best
public speakers always make what they say sound as if it
really matters. They know that if it matters to them, it will
matter to their audience. Many things contribute to the
success of a presentation― new and unusual content, a clear
structure, a good sense of timing, imaginative use of visual
aids, and the ability to make people laugh and think. But
above and beyond all of these is enthusiasm.
