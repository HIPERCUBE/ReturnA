Ignorance about the African continent has led to some
enormous errors in mapmaking. ( ① ) One of the errors
happened in the 1700s, when a European explorer reported
having seen mountains in southern Mali. ( ② ) As a result,
these “Kong Mountains,” as he called them, were drawn on
almost all maps of Africa in the 19th century, and they
seemed to be an important feature of the continental
geography. ( ③ ) European politicians and traders made
decisions based on their belief in the existence of these
mountains. ( ④ ) However, in the late 1880s, a French
explorer proved that there were no mountains in that part of
Africa. ( ⑤ ) Following that discovery, the “Kong
Mountains” disappeared from maps of Africa.
