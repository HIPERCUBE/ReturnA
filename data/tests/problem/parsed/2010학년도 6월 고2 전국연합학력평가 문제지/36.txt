36. Lost objects에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
According to a study conducted by an opinion research
institute, ninety percent of all people regularly have to
search for lost objects. The item people search for most is
keys. Ballpoint pens take second place on the list of missing
things. Third come eyeglasses, while purses take fourth
place. The object most commonly lost by people over 50 is
glasses. There are no great differences between men and
women. Women have a bit more trouble finding their purses,
but they look after their keys a little better than men. In
any case, it’s a waste of time and has a negative effect on
our moods if we create stress by searching for lost objects.
Forgetfulness with small things is not some unchangeable
natural phenomenon.
