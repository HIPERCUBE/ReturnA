When ‘a fool in the shower’ realizes that the water is too
cold, he turns on the hot water. However, the hot water
takes a while to arrive, so the fool simply turns the hot
water up all the way, eventually burning himself. ‘A fool in
the shower’ is a phrase coined by Milton Freidman, a Nobel
Prize­winning economist, who described the idea that
changes or policies planned to alter the course of the
economy should be done slowly, rather than all at once,
because it takes time to determine the effects of those
changes. That is, any change made to stimulate a broad
economy, especially one as large as the U.S. takes time to
work its way through. For example, a central bank’s move
like lowering the federal fund rate usually takes about six
months to fully integrate into the economy.
Since the effects of any economic policy change may not be
(A) , it is required to avoid making (B) judgements
on them.
(A) (B)
① trivial ‥‥‥ emotional
② prompt ‥‥‥ delayed
③ immediate ‥‥‥ hasty
④ disastrous ‥‥‥ irrational
⑤ predictable ‥‥‥ unbiased

(A) Natalie’s interest in writing was sparked by accident
back in September on the bus with her mom. She had been
a 6th grader for three weeks now and both (a) she and her
mom had already settled into their routine of commuting
together. It was a Friday afternoon, and they were going
home on the 5:55 coach, thundering through from New York
City to Hoboken, New Jersey.
(B) Natalie asked, “How come?” When (b) her dad died,
Natalie had decided she needed to talk to her mom more.
Sometimes (c) she pretended to be interested in her mom’s
work at the publishing company even when she wasn’t. Like
now. Her mom said, “Well, the marketing people keep track
of what kinds of books kids and parents and teachers are
buying. Then they tell us, and we’re supposed to make
more books like the ones they think people will buy. They
want us to publish more adventure books, more series
books, and more school stories.”
(C) Her mom looked exhausted. Natalie studied (d) her
face on the headrest. It was a pretty face― Prettier than
mine, she thought. But there were little lines at the corners
of her mother’s eyes and mouth. Care lines, worry lines.
Natalie asked, “Hard day, Mom?” Eyes still closed, her mom
smiled and nodded. “The editorial department met all day
with the marketing department― all day.”
(D) Then (e) she asked, “What’s a school story?” Her
mom said, “A school story is just what it sounds like― it’s
a short novel about kids and stuff that happens mostly at
school. Then Natalie said to herself, Hey, who knows more
about school than someone who’s right there, five days a
week, nine months a year? I bet I could write a school
story. And that was all it took. Natalie Nelson the novelist
was born.

Every night at 11 p.m., one village is thrown into total
darkness. Strapped for cash for the past few years, the
local council has taken to switching off all the streetlights
at night. But while the plan saves money, it has left some
residents worrying about their children coming home in the
dark. So one villager contacted the local utility company
and offered a solution: turning on the village lights with
. A few months later, the company
developed a special modem and software, Dial4Light.
The residents can now switch on the lights on a specific
street whenever they like. All they have to do is to
register for the plan online and provide their phone
number. Each time they need to light a street, they can
call the Dial4Light number. Within seconds, the lights are
on, and they can walk safely. The project last year proved
a big hit with the public. Therefore, the council decided to
carry out the plan for the entire surrounding villages
because the system could work in villages where residents
don’t need streetlights burning all night.
