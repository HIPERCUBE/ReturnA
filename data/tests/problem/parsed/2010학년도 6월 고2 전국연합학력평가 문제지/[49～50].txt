Every night at 11 p.m., one village is thrown into total
darkness. Strapped for cash for the past few years, the
local council has taken to switching off all the streetlights
at night. But while the plan saves money, it has left some
residents worrying about their children coming home in the
dark. So one villager contacted the local utility company
and offered a solution: turning on the village lights with
. A few months later, the company
developed a special modem and software, Dial4Light.
The residents can now switch on the lights on a specific
street whenever they like. All they have to do is to
register for the plan online and provide their phone
number. Each time they need to light a street, they can
call the Dial4Light number. Within seconds, the lights are
on, and they can walk safely. The project last year proved
a big hit with the public. Therefore, the council decided to
carry out the plan for the entire surrounding villages
because the system could work in villages where residents
don’t need streetlights burning all night.
