18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
This is an expression used to show concern for the
feelings of others. In everyday usage this describes behavior
which is somewhat formal and distancing. This may be
expressed both verbally and non‑verbally. Behavior such as
opening a door for another, avoiding telephoning a colleague
early on a Sunday morning, apologizing for interrupting a
speaker, or using courtesy titles like sir and madam could
all be considered expressions of this. In addition, since this
is culturally bound, appropriate ways to express this will
vary in different cultures.
