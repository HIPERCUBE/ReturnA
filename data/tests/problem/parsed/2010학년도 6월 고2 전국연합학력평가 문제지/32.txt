ourselves with. None of us could honestly say that we have
not ever been jealous of more fortunate and superior ones.

near equals like friends of equal social status, colleagues in
the office and relatives. We are not jealous of someone who

us. Jealousy keeps us under a sense of frustration and
disappointment. It is such a depressing feeling that we

it works like a slow poison to our healthy nature.
