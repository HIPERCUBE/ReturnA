When people gossip, they generally criticize other people, 
mostly for breaking social and moral codes. This may hurt 
people’s feelings or lead to misunderstandings.     (A)    , 
gossip plays an important social role by reinforcing 
community values: it makes people feel closer to each other; 
it unifies people who follow the rules; it helps people get a 
sense of the values of their community.     (B)    , it’s not 
a very nice thing to do, and I always felt bad after a gossipy 
conversation, even though I enjoyed it at the time. I want to 
stop telling unkind stories or being too curious about 
sensitive subjects.
