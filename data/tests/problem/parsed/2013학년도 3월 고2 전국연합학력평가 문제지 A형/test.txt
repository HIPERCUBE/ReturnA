23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Mike Michalowicz, the author of The Pumpkin Plan, argues 
that comedians are the ultimate public speakers. For 
example, comedians have to hold an audience’s attention for 
an hour or more, they don’t get a break during their 
presentation, and they can’t rely on the audience for a Q&A. 
They are also expected to make the audience laugh 
constantly. And they don’t even get to use presentation 
software programs, because they want the audience looking 
at them, not trying to read a screen. These facts don’t mean 
you need to be a comedian on stage to perform well. You 
aren’t even required to tell jokes. To enhance your own 
presentations, however, start to observe the techniques 
comedians use, and employ them in your own speech.
① 말을 할 때는 요점을 정확히 전달하라.

⑤ 뛰어난 코미디언이 되려면 유머 감각을 키워라.

I’m writing to discuss the kitchenware which I 
ordered through your website three days ago. 
The list of the items contains 3 dishes, 4 tea 
cups, 1 dinner set, and 2 pieces of glass 
cookware. However, after I ordered your 
products, my husband bought similar items from 
a department store. I really like your items, but 
I don’t need two similar products in my kitchen. 
Therefore, I’ll have to cancel my order. I know 
that the charges can be refunded if the order is 
canceled within seven days after the purchase. I 
want you to cancel the order as soon as 
possible. I am sorry for the inconvenience.
Sincerely,

25. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
The image of the self­sacrificing parent is often considered 
an ideal. The good father lives for his children at all costs. 
The good mother never takes a break and has no outside 
friendships or activities. Is this the ideal? In fact, the 
opposite is true. Overextended parents are often annoyed 
and depressed. Just as you can’t keep driving a car without 
ever refilling the gas, you can’t keep giving to kids without 
ever refueling emotionally. An afternoon out with friends for 
lunch can help you get refreshed. Even an hour alone in the 
tub with a good book can also make you emotionally relaxed. 
In this way, you can take care of your children with more 
energy, interest, and patience.

26. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Surfing is often thought of as a male sport, but in fact 
women have been surfing in California since the early 1920s 
and today there are women surfers in every surfing country 
in the world. Like men, they range from amateurs to 
professionals. Though women may not have been taken 
seriously in surf contests, these days they compete because 
they have truly earned that right. One of the earliest women 
surfers was Mary Hawkins, who showed very graceful form 
in the surf. She was the first in a long line which stretched 
down in the 1960s, to Marge Calhoun and her daughters, and 
Linda Benson, followed by some of the top professional 
surfers today.

As you climb higher and higher, the amount of oxygen in 
the atmosphere decreases. When people from lower areas visit areas of high altitude, they may suffer from altitude 
sickness; the ① lack of oxygen makes them feel tired, 
dizzy, and sick. People living in high altitudes are able to 
breathe ② normally because their bodies have become used 
to the shortage of oxygen. This also means that athletes 
from those areas can achieve ③ outstanding performances 
at lower altitudes. When mountaineers attempt to climb 
high peaks, they ④ get altitude sickness by climbing to one 
level and then resting for a few days. This gives their 
bodies time to ⑤ adapt to the lack of oxygen before 
climbing even higher.

For three days, the air around Nya’s home was filled with 
the sound of the drilling looking for clean water. On the 
third afternoon, Nya joined the other children gathered 
around the drill site. The adults stopped working and came 
there, too. The workers seemed excited. They were moving 
quickly as their leader called out orders. Then ― WHOOSH! 
A spray of water shot high into the air! This was new 
water ― water that was coming out of the hole! Everyone 
cheered at the sight of the water. A woman in the crowd 
began singing a song of celebration. Nya clapped her hands 
along with all the other children. But as Nya watched the 
water spraying out of the hole, she frowned. The water 
wasn’t clear. It was brown and heavy­looking. It was full of 
mud.

34. Most people, when trying to persuade others, do too much 
talking themselves. If you disagree with someone else, give 
them time to talk. They also have strong opinions like you 
do. So you should ask them questions. Let them tell you a 
few things. If you disagree with them, you may be tempted 
to interrupt. But you shouldn’t. It is dangerous. They won’t 
pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of 
their own they want to express. So              patiently 
and with an open mind. Encourage them to express their 
ideas fully.
① work ② study ③ listen
④ explain ⑤ challenge
35. Educating consumers is important because people can 
have great power over how goods are made and sold, 
depending on what they choose to buy. This power is 
sometimes shown through campaigns and boycotts, when 
people refuse to buy certain food products. For instance, 
thousands of dolphins used to be killed in tuna fishing nets, 
but                           helped to change this practice. 
Tuna that was caught without harming dolphins was labeled 
“dolphin friendly” so consumers wouldn’t buy other tuna 
products. This forced many companies to change their 
method of fishing. As a result, dolphin deaths decreased by 
over 80 percent between 1990 and 2000. [3점]

36. Consider a study of the power of social standards, 
involving nearly three hundred households in San Marcos, 
California. All of the households were informed about how 
much energy they had used in previous weeks; they were 
also given information about the average use of energy by 
households in their neighborhood. The effects on behavior 
were both clear and striking. In the following weeks, the 
above­average energy users greatly decreased their energy 
use; the below­average energy users greatly increased their 
energy use. The latter finding is called a boomerang effect, 
and it offers an important warning. If you want to encourage 
people to have socially desirable behavior, do not let them 
know that their current actions                      . [3점]

Instead of putting more armed police in the street, they 
chose to play classical music.
A fascinating experiment once took place in a small 
Australian village. ( ① ) For the past two years, the village 
had witnessed that the number of street crimes was rapidly 
increasing. ( ② ) Local residents, alarmed by the increase 
in street crime, got together and decided that the best way 
to confront the problem was to remove the offenders from 
the main street after nightfall. ( ③ ) Every single block 
began piping out the sounds of Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and 
Brahms. ( ④ ) In less than a week, the town reported a 
dramatic decrease in crime. ( ⑤ ) The experiment was so 
successful that the main train station in Copenhagen, 
Denmark adopted the same approach ― with similar results, 
too.

[41~43] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
In 1733, Philippe Rameau was considered one of the top 
French composers of his time. He made a long lasting and 
significant impact on the theory and various trends of 
music. Rameau was born on September 15, 1683 in the city 
of Dijon. He was famous because of his popular operas and 
(a) he was also known as one of the best organists in 
France. 
(B)
After dropping out of school, he got permission to pursue 
his musical career from his parents. In that year, Rameau 
started to work on his first book entitled Traite de 
l’harmonie, which made him one of the most important 
French theorists. At the end of the year, (b) he moved to 
Paris, hoping to get some greater respect and fame in the 
music industry as a composer. In Paris he took the 
assistance of some local students and composed numerous 
short stage and keyboard works. 
(C)
After all of this, he got the attention of a financial 
supporter named Poupliniere. He hired Rameau as the chief 
conductor of his orchestra. Poupliniere also allowed him and 
his family members to live in (c) his grand mansion. With 
the help of Poupliniere, Rameau met some of the best 
writers and composers of his time and composed his first 
opera known as Hippolyte et Aricie. And it made him one 
of the leading French composers.
(D)
The father of Philippe Rameau was also a professional 
organist. He expected his son to pursue a career in the 
field of law, but Philippe Rameau was very passionate about 
music. That is why he lived his whole life as a composer 
and musician. (d) He also educated himself about several 
musical instruments. When he was in the Jesuit College of 
Dijon, he was removed because of his lack of concentration 
on (e) his studies and his excessive focus on music.

[44~45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Now think about blogging. The number of blogs out there 
is amazing, and it seems that almost everyone has a blog 
or is thinking about starting one. Why are blogs so popular? 
Not only is it because so many people have the desire to 
write, it is also because blogs have two features that 
distinguish them from other forms of writing. First, they 
provide the hope that someone else will read one’s writing. 
After all, the moment a blogger presses the “publish” 
button, the blog can be consumed by anybody in the world, 
and with so many people connected, somebody, or at least 
a few people, should stumble upon the blog. Indeed, the 
“number of views” statistic is a highly motivating feature in 
the blog world because it lets the blogger know exactly 
how many people have at least seen the posting. Blogs also 
provide readers with the ability to leave their reactions and 
comments ― satisfying both the blogger and the reader. 
Most blogs have very                    ― perhaps only 
the blogger’s mother or best friend reads them ― but even 
writing for one person, compared to writing for nobody, 
seems to be enough to encourage millions of people to blog.
