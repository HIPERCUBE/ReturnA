Surfing is often thought of as a male sport, but in fact 
women have been surfing in California since the early 1920s 
and today there are women surfers in every surfing country 
in the world. Like men, they range from amateurs to 
professionals. Though women may not have been taken 
seriously in surf contests, these days they compete because 
they have truly earned that right. One of the earliest women 
surfers was Mary Hawkins, who showed very graceful form 
in the surf. She was the first in a long line which stretched 
down in the 1960s, to Marge Calhoun and her daughters, and 
Linda Benson, followed by some of the top professional 
surfers today.
