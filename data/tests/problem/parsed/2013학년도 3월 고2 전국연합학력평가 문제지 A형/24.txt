To Whom It May Concern:
I’m writing to discuss the kitchenware which I 
ordered through your website three days ago. 
The list of the items contains 3 dishes, 4 tea 
cups, 1 dinner set, and 2 pieces of glass 
cookware. However, after I ordered your 
products, my husband bought similar items from 
a department store. I really like your items, but 
I don’t need two similar products in my kitchen. 
Therefore, I’ll have to cancel my order. I know 
that the charges can be refunded if the order is 
canceled within seven days after the purchase. I 
want you to cancel the order as soon as 
possible. I am sorry for the inconvenience.
Sincerely,
Kelly Stone
