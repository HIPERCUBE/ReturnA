Now think about blogging. The number of blogs out there 
is amazing, and it seems that almost everyone has a blog 
or is thinking about starting one. Why are blogs so popular? 
Not only is it because so many people have the desire to 
write, it is also because blogs have two features that 
distinguish them from other forms of writing. First, they 
provide the hope that someone else will read one’s writing. 
After all, the moment a blogger presses the “publish” 
button, the blog can be consumed by anybody in the world, 
and with so many people connected, somebody, or at least 
a few people, should stumble upon the blog. Indeed, the 
“number of views” statistic is a highly motivating feature in 
the blog world because it lets the blogger know exactly 
how many people have at least seen the posting. Blogs also 
provide readers with the ability to leave their reactions and 
comments ― satisfying both the blogger and the reader. 
Most blogs have very                    ― perhaps only 
the blogger’s mother or best friend reads them ― but even 
writing for one person, compared to writing for nobody, 
seems to be enough to encourage millions of people to blog.
