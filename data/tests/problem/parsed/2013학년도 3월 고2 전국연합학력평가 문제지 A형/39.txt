Instead of putting more armed police in the street, they 
chose to play classical music.
A fascinating experiment once took place in a small 
Australian village. ( ① ) For the past two years, the village 
had witnessed that the number of street crimes was rapidly 
increasing. ( ② ) Local residents, alarmed by the increase 
in street crime, got together and decided that the best way 
to confront the problem was to remove the offenders from 
the main street after nightfall. ( ③ ) Every single block 
began piping out the sounds of Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and 
Brahms. ( ④ ) In less than a week, the town reported a 
dramatic decrease in crime. ( ⑤ ) The experiment was so 
successful that the main train station in Copenhagen, 
Denmark adopted the same approach ― with similar results, 
too.
