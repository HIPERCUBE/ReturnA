Hugh Baldwin has proved that a kind heart can pay off. On 
November 3, Hugh found a cat with a broken leg lying in 
the street. Hugh was on his way to school, but he stopped 
to help. ① He got some water for the cat and sat by the cat 
waiting for passersby. ② At last, Mrs. Belle Simkins, living 
in his neighborhood, saw them and stopped. ③ People living 
in this area recently complained about the noise of cats at 
night. ④ Mrs. Simkins and Hugh took the cat to the 
veterinarian to treat it. ⑤ While Hugh went on to school, the 
owner was located. He received a reward of $10 from the 
cat’s grateful master.
