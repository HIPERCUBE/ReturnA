As you climb higher and higher, the amount of oxygen in 
the atmosphere decreases. When people from lower areas visit areas of high altitude, they may suffer from altitude 
sickness; the ① lack of oxygen makes them feel tired, 
dizzy, and sick. People living in high altitudes are able to 
breathe ② normally because their bodies have become used 
to the shortage of oxygen. This also means that athletes 
from those areas can achieve ③ outstanding performances 
at lower altitudes. When mountaineers attempt to climb 
high peaks, they ④ get altitude sickness by climbing to one 
level and then resting for a few days. This gives their 
bodies time to ⑤ adapt to the lack of oxygen before 
climbing even higher.
* altitude: 고도, 높이
