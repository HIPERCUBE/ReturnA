34. Most people, when trying to persuade others, do too much 
talking themselves. If you disagree with someone else, give 
them time to talk. They also have strong opinions like you 
do. So you should ask them questions. Let them tell you a 
few things. If you disagree with them, you may be tempted 
to interrupt. But you shouldn’t. It is dangerous. They won’t 
pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of 
their own they want to express. So              patiently 
and with an open mind. Encourage them to express their 
ideas fully.
