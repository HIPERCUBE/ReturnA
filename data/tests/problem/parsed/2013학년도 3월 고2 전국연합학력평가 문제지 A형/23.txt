Mike Michalowicz, the author of The Pumpkin Plan, argues 
that comedians are the ultimate public speakers. For 
example, comedians have to hold an audience’s attention for 
an hour or more, they don’t get a break during their 
presentation, and they can’t rely on the audience for a Q&A. 
They are also expected to make the audience laugh 
constantly. And they don’t even get to use presentation 
software programs, because they want the audience looking 
at them, not trying to read a screen. These facts don’t mean 
you need to be a comedian on stage to perform well. You 
aren’t even required to tell jokes. To enhance your own 
presentations, however, start to observe the techniques 
comedians use, and employ them in your own speech.
