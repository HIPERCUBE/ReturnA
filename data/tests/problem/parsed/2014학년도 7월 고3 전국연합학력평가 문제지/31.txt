This graph shows activity rates for three age groups from 
five countries in 2010. The activity rate represents the 
proportion of the labor force population to the population of 
working age. ①The age groups consist of 15­24, 25­54, and 
55­64, with the core group of 25­54 showing the highest 
activity rate for each country. ②The 15­24 group shows the 
lowest rate in each country. ③In France and the United 
Kingdom, the gaps between the 15­24 and 55­64 age groups 
show just 1%,  but the gap between Korea’s 15­24 and 55­64 
groups shows the greatest contrast. ④The percentage of
Germany’s 25­54 age group is 10% less than that of Korea’s. 
⑤Italy has the smallest percentage among the five countries’ 
55­64 age groups.
