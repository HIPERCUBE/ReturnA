Despite the conventional wisdom of some management trainers 
that group brainstorming is an effective way of generating 
ideas, more objective research has recently suggested 
otherwise. ①People working in groups often produce ideas that 
are fewer in number and lower in quality than the same 
individuals working for a period alone. ②When people engaging 
in group problem­solving share their thoughts and information 
too quickly, none of them has a chance to develop an 
independent viewpoint before it is subject to influence by the 
thoughts and experiences of others. ③People participating in 
brainstorming build their solutions on the ideas of others, “think 
them up” and improve them, and this synergy effect allows that 
better and better ideas are generated. ④Under such conditions, 
it has been shown that people tend to converge too rapidly on a 
solution, or at least on an agreed way of conceptualizing the 
problem, that may be less than optimal. ⑤When you insert 
periods of more solitary thinking between the discussions, you 
tend to get higher­quality ideas and solutions.
