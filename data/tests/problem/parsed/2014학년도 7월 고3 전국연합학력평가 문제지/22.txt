It’s no coincidence that some people are just like their 
dogs. Researchers in Bath, England, conducted an online 
survey of 1,000 dog owners and found that certain human 
personality traits link to specific canines. The research 
claims that if you own a German Shepherd, you’re most 
likely outgoing. Got a Golden Retriever? Odds are you’re 
conscientious. A Chihuahua? Research says you’re agreeable. 
“It seems likely that personality types are subconsciously 
drawn to certain breeds,” reported study author Lance 
Workman in a British Psychological Society news release. 
The study indicates that you may be able to predict 
someone’s personality based on his or her dog of choice. Of 
course, lifestyle plays a part too. For example, according to 
Workman, more active individuals are better suited to 
athletic, pastoral breeds such as Border Collies, while those 
who are considered emotionally stable might be suited to 
hound dogs such as Beagles or Greyhounds.
