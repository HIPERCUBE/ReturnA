“Where there’s a will with power, there’s a way.” The 
way comes after the will with power. You must be hungry 
enough, strong enough, resilient enough, to desire change 
and make change happen. You’ve got the will with power, 
so now you can define your course. Your course is critical. 
But there is not any one course for any one journey. A 
wise person once told me that what’s important is not so 
much the path you’re on as the direction you’re headed. 
You may get bumped off your path, pushed this way and 
that, but if your direction is true, your journey will be 
true. A roadblock may require a change of path, but your 
destination remains the same. So what is your way? It is 
the path you define, day by day, to get you to your dream. 
It takes will power to define your way. 
① 의지력을 가지고 목표를 향해 나아가야 한다.
② 치밀한 계획을 통해서 다양한 변수에 대비해야 한다.
③ 자신의 내면을 성찰하는 시간을 충분히 가져야 한다.
④ 역경에 직면했을 때 전문가의 조언을 얻는 것이 필요하다. 
⑤ 목표 성취를 위해 자신의 목표를 주변 사람들에게 알려야 한다.
20. 다음 글에 나타난 필자의 주장으로 가장 적절한 것은?
A planning discussion can be fairly complex and 
fast­paced, causing us to forget things. Take the time to 
summarize what’s supposed to happen. It could sound 
something like this: “Let me see if I got this right. Bill, 
you’ll get the nine copies of the report, stapled with a 
standard company cover sheet, for the meeting Tuesday at 2 p.m. 
Is that right?” Bill would probably say, “Right,” and then you 
could ask him whether there is anything else that you 
haven’t talked about that might cause a problem. When you 
ask for the other person’s input, it can help bring to light 
issues that might otherwise cause problems. However, the 
real power of this question goes far beyond clarifying 
understanding. You’re checking for commitment. When the 
other person eventually says, “I’ll do it,” that person is much 
more likely to live up to the agreement. Never walk away 
from a crucial confrontation satisfied with a vague nod. If 
you care about gaining genuine commitment, give the other 
person the opportunity to say yes to a very specific 
agreement.

④ 지속적인 대화와 이해를 통해 갈등 관계를 해결해라.  
⑤ 업무 배정 시 직원들의 업무 능력을 충분히 고려해라.
21. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] 
People’s preferences affect decisions about consumption 
and trade. Not only is there variation in preference across 
people, but there also is variation based on how much has 
already been consumed. For example, you might get a lot of 
pleasure from drinking a cup of coffee in the morning, and 
be willing to trade $3 for that coffee. But, after finishing 
that first cup of coffee, the second cup of coffee might not 
be quite as valuable to you. At some point, you will have 
had so much coffee that you’re not willing to part with $3 
to get another cup. Economists often use the generic term 
“utility” to refer to the pleasure, value, or usefulness of 
something that is consumed or experienced. In this example, 
then, you are making a decision about whether the utility of 
another cup of coffee is greater than the utility of having $3 
to spend on something else.  

① independent factors in price­making
② causes of unreasonable consumption
③ the consequences of compulsive consumption
④ limitations of comparing the values of two options    
⑤ the influence of diminishing utility on purchase decisions

It’s no coincidence that some people are just like their 
dogs. Researchers in Bath, England, conducted an online 
survey of 1,000 dog owners and found that certain human 
personality traits link to specific canines. The research 
claims that if you own a German Shepherd, you’re most 
likely outgoing. Got a Golden Retriever? Odds are you’re 
conscientious. A Chihuahua? Research says you’re agreeable. 
“It seems likely that personality types are subconsciously 
drawn to certain breeds,” reported study author Lance 
Workman in a British Psychological Society news release. 
The study indicates that you may be able to predict 
someone’s personality based on his or her dog of choice. Of 
course, lifestyle plays a part too. For example, according to 
Workman, more active individuals are better suited to 
athletic, pastoral breeds such as Border Collies, while those 
who are considered emotionally stable might be suited to 
hound dogs such as Beagles or Greyhounds.

A friend of mine mentioned last week that he once bought a 
Frankies chicken and he discovered after getting home that it 
was all dry and nasty. ① He took it back to the store and 
got an immediate refund. Then he decided to write to Walter 
Robinson, the CEO of Frankies Chickens, and tell ② him that 
he had bought one of his quality chickens and it was all dry 
and nasty. By return mail he got a letter from Walter that 
not only included lengthy apologies and a certificate for a 
free chicken, but that also asked for ③ his help to make sure 
it never happened again by asking a whole list of specific 
questions: Where did he buy it? When? Exactly what was 
wrong? What did ④ he think had happened? What exactly did 
the store say when he returned it? Two days later an 
executive of Frankies Chickens called to make sure ⑤ he had 
received the letter, to make sure that all was well, and to 
ask some more specific questions. My friend will never buy 
anything but Frankies chicken.

Not many years ago, schoolchildren were taught that carbon 
dioxide is the ①naturally occurring lifeblood of plants, just as 
oxygen is ours. Today, children are more likely to think of 
carbon dioxide as a poison. That’s because the amount of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere ②has increased substantially over the 
past one hundred years, from about 280 parts per million to 
380. But what people don’t know is that the carbon dioxide level 
some 80 million years ago ―back when our mammalian 
ancestors were evolving ―③to be at least 1,000 parts per 
million. In fact, that is the concentration of carbon dioxide you 
regularly breathe if you work in a new energy­efficient office 
building, for ④that is the level established by the engineering 
group that sets standards for heating and ventilation systems. So 
not only ⑤is carbon dioxide plainly not poisonous, but changes 
in carbon dioxide levels don’t necessarily mirror human activity. 
Nor has atmospheric carbon dioxide necessarily been the trigger 
for global warming historically.

Whether an animal can feel anything resembling the loneliness 
humans feel is hard to say. However, highly social animals, such 
as certain types of parrot, seem to be ①adversely affected when 
kept alone. Some parrots will engage in bizarre behaviors and 
can severely harm themselves. Some large parrots will even 
seem to go insane if subjected to long periods of ② isolation. On 
the other hand, certain animals that are by nature ③solitary 
hardly appear to be affected at all. Some fish, in particular some 
types of cichlids, will even ④fight viciously with their own kind 
if more than one is kept in an aquarium. Guam rails, a kind of 
flightless bird, are ⑤tolerant of their own kind, which has 
obviously made breeding them in captivity very difficult. 
26. 다음 글에 드러난 Joseph Bell의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Joseph Bell was a top­class violinist in the world. One day a 
reporter suggested an experiment to Joseph for a newspaper 
cover story designed to test Joseph’s musical ability to influence 
people. But there was one condition: people should not know who 
he was. Joseph was sure of his musical ability to touch others’ 
hearts and accepted his proposal without hesitation. On a Friday 
morning at rush hour, Joseph took his Stradivarius violin, for 
which he’d paid more than $3 million, and headed to the L’Enfant 
plaza subway stop in Washington, D.C. He set up shop between 
an entrance and an escalator, opened his violin case to take 
donations, seeded it with $20 of his own, and began to perform 
several complex classical pieces expecting himself surrounded by 
many pedestrians in a minute. Over the course of his 
forty­three­minute performance, more than one thousand people 
passed within a few feet of him. Among them, only one stopped 
to listen. As time went by, the violin sound faded and he slowly 
packed up walking away with only $1 earned.
① excited → envious  ② anxious → proud

Despite the conventional wisdom of some management trainers 
that group brainstorming is an effective way of generating 
ideas, more objective research has recently suggested 
otherwise. ①People working in groups often produce ideas that 
are fewer in number and lower in quality than the same 
individuals working for a period alone. ②When people engaging 
in group problem­solving share their thoughts and information 
too quickly, none of them has a chance to develop an 
independent viewpoint before it is subject to influence by the 
thoughts and experiences of others. ③People participating in 
brainstorming build their solutions on the ideas of others, “think 
them up” and improve them, and this synergy effect allows that 
better and better ideas are generated. ④Under such conditions, 
it has been shown that people tend to converge too rapidly on a 
solution, or at least on an agreed way of conceptualizing the 
problem, that may be less than optimal. ⑤When you insert 
periods of more solitary thinking between the discussions, you 
tend to get higher­quality ideas and solutions.

33.  Recalling childhood memories can                  , 
according to a study published in April in the Journal of 
Personality and Social Psychology. In a series of 
experiments done by Francesca Gino and Sreedhari Desai of 
Harvard University, participants were more likely to help 
the experimenters with an extra task, judge immoral 
behavior harshly, and donate money to charity when they 
had actively remembered their childhood. The effect held 
whether the memories were positive or negative ― although, 
notably, the study subjects did not have traumatic histories. 
These recollections seem to summon a heightened sense of 
moral purity. Youngsters may or may not behave especially 
ethically, but childhood tends to connote innocence ― a 
frame of mind that affects behavior. “It’s promising research 
in thinking about ways in which people are following their 
moral compass with very simple interventions,” Gino says. 

① lessen separation anxiety effectively
② lead people to behave more ethically
③ help people overcome behavioral disorder          
④ be accompanied by feelings of uncertainty
⑤ boost one’s sense of happiness temporarily

34.  Imagine that you are French. You are walking along a busy 
pavement in Paris and another pedestrian is approaching from 
the opposite direction. A collision will occur unless you each 
move out of the other’s way. Which way do you step? The 
answer is almost certainly to the right. Replay the same scene 
in many parts of Asia, however, and you would probably move 
to the left. There is no instruction to head in a specific 
direction. Mehdi Moussaid says this is a behavior brought about 
by    (A)    . If two opposing people guess each other’s 
intentions correctly, each moving to one side and allowing the 
other past, then they are likely to choose to move the same 
way the next time they need to avoid a collision. The chance 
of a successful maneuver increases as more and more people 
adopt a bias in one direction, until the tendency sticks. Whether 
it’s right or left does not matter; what does is that it is the

policeman arresting a youth when he was, in fact, giving the 
youth directions. You must check the facts, both for your 
own sake and for the sake of your informants, who would 
not wish to appear foolish. Sometimes,   (B)  , the 
informant is deliberately trying to trick you for his or her 
own reasons. Perhaps it is to cover up a mistake, perhaps to 
avoid appearing ignorant, occasionally to give false

Competition can be extremely healthy. It drives us to 
improve, to reach and stretch. Without it, we would never 
know how far we could push ourselves. In the business 
world, it makes our economy prosper. 
(A) The difference is this: Competition is healthy when you 
compete against yourself, or when it challenges you to 
reach and stretch and become your best. Competition 
becomes dark when you tie your self­worth into winning or 
when you use it as a way to place yourself above another.
(B) Later, Luke confronts the evil Darth Vader and learns 
about the “dark side” of the force. As Darth puts it, “You 
don’t know the power of the dark side.” So it is with 
competition. There is a sunny side and a dark side, and 
both are powerful.
(C) But there is another side to competition that isn’t so nice. 
In the movie Star Wars, Luke Skywalker learns about the 
positive energy shield called “the force,” which gives life 
to all things.

Understanding networks can lead to innovative, 
non­obvious strategies. Randomly immunizing a population 
to prevent the spread of infection typically requires that 
80 to 100 percent of the population be immunized.
(A) This strategy allows us to exploit a property of networks 
even if we cannot see the whole structure. Acquaintances 
have more links and are more central to the network than 
are the randomly chosen people who named them. 
(B) To prevent measles epidemics, for example, 95 percent of 
the population must be immunized. A more efficient 
alternative is to target the hubs of the network, namely, 
those people at the center of the network or those with 
the most contacts. 
(C) However, it is often not possible to discern network ties 
in advance in a population when trying to figure out how 
best to immunize it. A creative alternative is to immunize 
the acquaintances of randomly selected individuals. [3점]

All participants were equally accurate, but the older 
group responded more slowly.
Older adults often take longer to make a decision than 
young adults do. But that does not mean they are any less 
sharp. ( ① ) According to research at Ohio State 
University, the slower response time of older adults has 
more to do with prizing accuracy over speed. ( ② ) In the 
study, published recently in the Journal of Experimental 
Psychology: General, college­age students and adults aged 
60 to 90 performed timed tests of word recognition and 
recall. ( ③ ) When the researchers encouraged them to 
work faster, however, they were able to match the 
youngsters’ speed without significantly sacrificing accuracy. 
( ④ ) “In many simple tasks, the elderly take longer mainly 
because they decide to require more evidence to make their 
decision,”　 says co­author Roger Ratcliff. ( ⑤ ) When an 
older mind faces a task that requires speed, he says, a 
conscious effort to work faster can often do the trick.

On the other hand, many of the germs that live in or 
on the bodies of all animals, including humans, are not 
simply parasitic, but contribute important protective, 
stimulant or nutritional effects.
Whatever the benefit to a virus of a long­lived host, there 
is no guarantee that hosts have mechanisms for increasing 
longevity that the virus could exploit. Nor need host 
longevity be an advantage. ( ① ) The interests of the 
virus depend on its life­cycle strategy, and some viruses 
are only released on the death of the host. ( ② ) In fact, 
many parasites actually force their host to attack other 
potential hosts or to be killed or eaten so that the 
parasites are passed on. ( ③ ) In some ways, this can be 
seen as a form of life extension because removing the 
germs could have drastic, possibly fatal effects on the host. 
( ④ ) Extreme examples include endosymbiont root fungi 
in orchids, or mitochondria in our cells. ( ⑤ ) Without 
them, orchids and humans would not survive. [3점]

One very important factor in the persuasiveness of a 
communication concerns the credibility of the sender of the 
message. Kelman and Hovland performed a study in which 
people heard a talk about juvenile delinquency, given by one 
of three speakers. One of the speakers claimed to be a 
juvenile court judge, and therefore was thought to have high 
credibility; one speaker was described as a random member 
of the studio audience, whose credibility was thought to be 
neutral; and one speaker was described as a ‘pickpocket’, 
and so was thought to have low credibility. Kelman and 
Hovland found that the more credible the communicator was, 
the more influence their talk had exerted on the listeners. 
However, when they retested the research participants four 
weeks later, they found that the source effect had entirely 
disappeared. People remembered what had been said, but not 
who had said it. So it is possible that the credibility of the 
source is important only in the short term.

Hector had always been known as a great shoemaker. In 
fact, customers from such far­off places as France claimed 
that Hector made the best shoes in the world. Yet for 
years, he had been frustrated with his small shoemaking 
business. Although Hector knew he was capable of making 
hundreds of shoes per week, he was averaging just 30 
pairs. When a friend asked him why, Hector explained that 
while he was great at producing shoes, he was a poor 
salesman ― and terrible when it came to collecting 
payments. Yet he spent most of his time working in these 
areas of weakness. So, Hector’s friend introduced him to 
Sergio, an innate salesman and marketer. Just as Hector 
was known for his craftsmanship, Sergio could close deals 
and sell. Given the way their strengths complemented one 
another, Hector and Sergio decided to work together. A 
year later, this strengths­based duo was producing, selling, 
and collecting payment for more than 100 pairs of shoes 
per week ― a more than threefold increase. While this 
story may seem simplistic, in many cases, aligning yourself 
with the right task can be this easy. When we’re able to 
put most of our energy into developing our            , we 
can achieve our full potential. So, a revision to the “You can 
be anything you want to be” maxim might be more accurate: 
You cannot be anything you want to be ― but you can be a 
lot more of who you already are.

(A) 
My grandfather came from Hungary, and was educated 
in Germany. He was the only one in his family to come 
to the United States. He still had relatives living in 
Europe. When the first World War broke out, he 
lamented the fact that if my uncle, his only son, had to 
go, it would mean that (a) he might fight against his 
cousins.
(B) 
It had gone about a thousand yards when it suddenly 
ground to a halt. The band stopped playing, the crowd 
stopped cheering. Everyone gazed in wonder as the train 
slowly backed up and returned to the station. It seemed an 
eternity until the doors opened and the men started to file 
out. Someone shouted, “It’s the armistice. The war is over.” 
For a moment, nobody moved, but then the people heard 
someone bark orders at the soldiers. My uncle walked down 
the steps and paraded down the street with other soldiers, 
as a returning hero, to be welcomed home by the assembled 
crowd. The next day he returned to (b) his job. 
(C) 
One day, the inevitable happened and my uncle Milton 
received his draft notice. My grandparents were very upset, 
but my mother, his little sister was thrilled. She was ten 
years old and my uncle, realizing how (c) he was regarded 
by his little sister and all of her friends, went out and 
bought them all service pins as gifts, which meant that they 
had a loved one in the service. All the little girls were 
delighted. When the day came for (d) him to leave, his 
whole regiment, in their uniforms, left together from the 
same train station.            * draft: 징병 ** regiment: [군사] 연대
(D) 
The soldiers, all rookies, none of whom had had any 
training, but who had nevertheless all been issued, wore 
uniforms and boarded the train. The band played and the 
crowd cheered. Although no one noticed, I’m sure my 
grandfather had a tear in (e) his eye for the only son, 
going off to war. The train groaned as if it knew the 
destiny to which it was taking its passengers, but it soon 
began to move. The people still cheering and waving their 
flags, the band still playing, the train slowly departed the 
station.
