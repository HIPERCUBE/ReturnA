Honor your children in celebration of their birthdays or in 
recognition of their accomplishments by donating a book 
through the Williams Book Club. You can support our library by 
immediately adding a new book to its holdings. Diane Jordan, 
Williams’ Media Specialist, has put together a wish list of 
books based in part on suggestions from students. Library 
bound books generally cost $15 or $20. You have the choice to 
donate either of those amounts. Mrs. Jordan will purchase a 
book from the list with your monetary donation. Your gift book 
will have a personalized label inside stating that it was given 
to Williams Middle School in honor of your child. Your child’s 
name will be mentioned during the morning show’s Book Club 
Highlights and the gift book will be placed in a special section 
of the Media Center featuring Book Club books. If you have 
questions about the books, please contact Mrs. Jordan at 
d.jordan@williamsbookclub.com, or phone at 1-800-456-4959.
