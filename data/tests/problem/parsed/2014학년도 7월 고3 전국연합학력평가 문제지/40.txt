One very important factor in the persuasiveness of a 
communication concerns the credibility of the sender of the 
message. Kelman and Hovland performed a study in which 
people heard a talk about juvenile delinquency, given by one 
of three speakers. One of the speakers claimed to be a 
juvenile court judge, and therefore was thought to have high 
credibility; one speaker was described as a random member 
of the studio audience, whose credibility was thought to be 
neutral; and one speaker was described as a ‘pickpocket’, 
and so was thought to have low credibility. Kelman and 
Hovland found that the more credible the communicator was, 
the more influence their talk had exerted on the listeners. 
However, when they retested the research participants four 
weeks later, they found that the source effect had entirely 
disappeared. People remembered what had been said, but not 
who had said it. So it is possible that the credibility of the 
source is important only in the short term.

Hector had always been known as a great shoemaker. In 
fact, customers from such far­off places as France claimed 
that Hector made the best shoes in the world. Yet for 
years, he had been frustrated with his small shoemaking 
business. Although Hector knew he was capable of making 
hundreds of shoes per week, he was averaging just 30 
pairs. When a friend asked him why, Hector explained that 
while he was great at producing shoes, he was a poor 
salesman ― and terrible when it came to collecting 
payments. Yet he spent most of his time working in these 
areas of weakness. So, Hector’s friend introduced him to 
Sergio, an innate salesman and marketer. Just as Hector 
was known for his craftsmanship, Sergio could close deals 
and sell. Given the way their strengths complemented one 
another, Hector and Sergio decided to work together. A 
year later, this strengths­based duo was producing, selling, 
and collecting payment for more than 100 pairs of shoes 
per week ― a more than threefold increase. While this 
story may seem simplistic, in many cases, aligning yourself 
with the right task can be this easy. When we’re able to 
put most of our energy into developing our            , we 
can achieve our full potential. So, a revision to the “You can 
be anything you want to be” maxim might be more accurate: 
You cannot be anything you want to be ― but you can be a 
lot more of who you already are.
