32.  In a penalty situation in soccer, the ball takes less than 0.3 
seconds to travel from the player who kicks the ball to the goal. 
There is not enough time for the goalkeeper to watch the ball’s 
trajectory. He must make a decision before the ball is kicked. 
Soccer players who take penalty kicks shoot one third of the 
time at the middle of the goal, one third of the time at the left, 
and one third of the time at the right. Surely goalkeepers have 
spotted this, but what do they do? They dive either to the left 
or to the right. Rarely do they stay standing in the middle ―
even though roughly a third of all balls land there. Why would 
they jeopardize saving these penalties? The simple answer:       
. It looks more impressive and feels less 
embarrassing to dive to the wrong side than to freeze on the 
spot and watch the ball sail past. [3점]
