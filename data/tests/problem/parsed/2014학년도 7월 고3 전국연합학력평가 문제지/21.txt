People’s preferences affect decisions about consumption 
and trade. Not only is there variation in preference across 
people, but there also is variation based on how much has 
already been consumed. For example, you might get a lot of 
pleasure from drinking a cup of coffee in the morning, and 
be willing to trade $3 for that coffee. But, after finishing 
that first cup of coffee, the second cup of coffee might not 
be quite as valuable to you. At some point, you will have 
had so much coffee that you’re not willing to part with $3 
to get another cup. Economists often use the generic term 
“utility” to refer to the pleasure, value, or usefulness of 
something that is consumed or experienced. In this example, 
then, you are making a decision about whether the utility of 
another cup of coffee is greater than the utility of having $3 
to spend on something else.
