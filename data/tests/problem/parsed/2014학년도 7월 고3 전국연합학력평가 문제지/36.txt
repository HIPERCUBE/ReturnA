Competition can be extremely healthy. It drives us to 
improve, to reach and stretch. Without it, we would never 
know how far we could push ourselves. In the business 
world, it makes our economy prosper. 
(A) The difference is this: Competition is healthy when you 
compete against yourself, or when it challenges you to 
reach and stretch and become your best. Competition 
becomes dark when you tie your self­worth into winning or 
when you use it as a way to place yourself above another.
(B) Later, Luke confronts the evil Darth Vader and learns 
about the “dark side” of the force. As Darth puts it, “You 
don’t know the power of the dark side.” So it is with 
competition. There is a sunny side and a dark side, and 
both are powerful.
(C) But there is another side to competition that isn’t so nice. 
In the movie Star Wars, Luke Skywalker learns about the 
positive energy shield called “the force,” which gives life 
to all things.
