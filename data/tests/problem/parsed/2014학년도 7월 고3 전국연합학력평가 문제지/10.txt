Honor your children in celebration of their birthdays or in 
recognition of their accomplishments by donating a book 
through the Williams Book Club. You can support our library by 
immediately adding a new book to its holdings. Diane Jordan, 
Williams’ Media Specialist, has put together a wish list of 
books based in part on suggestions from students. Library 
bound books generally cost $15 or $20. You have the choice to 
donate either of those amounts. Mrs. Jordan will purchase a 
book from the list with your monetary donation. Your gift book 
will have a personalized label inside stating that it was given 
to Williams Middle School in honor of your child. Your child’s 
name will be mentioned during the morning show’s Book Club 
Highlights and the gift book will be placed in a special section 
of the Media Center featuring Book Club books. If you have 
questions about the books, please contact Mrs. Jordan at

19. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
“Where there’s a will with power, there’s a way.” The 
way comes after the will with power. You must be hungry 
enough, strong enough, resilient enough, to desire change 
and make change happen. You’ve got the will with power, 
so now you can define your course. Your course is critical. 
But there is not any one course for any one journey. A 
wise person once told me that what’s important is not so 
much the path you’re on as the direction you’re headed. 
You may get bumped off your path, pushed this way and 
that, but if your direction is true, your journey will be 
true. A roadblock may require a change of path, but your 
destination remains the same. So what is your way? It is 
the path you define, day by day, to get you to your dream. 
It takes will power to define your way. 
① 의지력을 가지고 목표를 향해 나아가야 한다.
② 치밀한 계획을 통해서 다양한 변수에 대비해야 한다.
③ 자신의 내면을 성찰하는 시간을 충분히 가져야 한다.
④ 역경에 직면했을 때 전문가의 조언을 얻는 것이 필요하다. 
⑤ 목표 성취를 위해 자신의 목표를 주변 사람들에게 알려야 한다.
20. 다음 글에 나타난 필자의 주장으로 가장 적절한 것은?
A planning discussion can be fairly complex and 
fast­paced, causing us to forget things. Take the time to 
summarize what’s supposed to happen. It could sound 
something like this: “Let me see if I got this right. Bill, 
you’ll get the nine copies of the report, stapled with a 
standard company cover sheet, for the meeting Tuesday at 2 p.m. 
Is that right?” Bill would probably say, “Right,” and then you 
could ask him whether there is anything else that you 
haven’t talked about that might cause a problem. When you 
ask for the other person’s input, it can help bring to light 
issues that might otherwise cause problems. However, the 
real power of this question goes far beyond clarifying 
understanding. You’re checking for commitment. When the 
other person eventually says, “I’ll do it,” that person is much 
more likely to live up to the agreement. Never walk away 
from a crucial confrontation satisfied with a vague nod. If 
you care about gaining genuine commitment, give the other 
person the opportunity to say yes to a very specific 
agreement. 
① 명확한 업무 확인 과정을 통해 상대방의 책무성을 높여라.
② 업무상의 실수에 대해서 관대한 태도를 지녀라.

④ 지속적인 대화와 이해를 통해 갈등 관계를 해결해라.  
⑤ 업무 배정 시 직원들의 업무 능력을 충분히 고려해라.
21. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] 
People’s preferences affect decisions about consumption 
and trade. Not only is there variation in preference across 
people, but there also is variation based on how much has 
already been consumed. For example, you might get a lot of 
pleasure from drinking a cup of coffee in the morning, and 
be willing to trade $3 for that coffee. But, after finishing 
that first cup of coffee, the second cup of coffee might not 
be quite as valuable to you. At some point, you will have 
had so much coffee that you’re not willing to part with $3 
to get another cup. Economists often use the generic term 
“utility” to refer to the pleasure, value, or usefulness of 
something that is consumed or experienced. In this example, 
then, you are making a decision about whether the utility of 
another cup of coffee is greater than the utility of having $3 
to spend on something else.
