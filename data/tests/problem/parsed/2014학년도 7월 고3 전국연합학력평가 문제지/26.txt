Joseph Bell was a top­class violinist in the world. One day a 
reporter suggested an experiment to Joseph for a newspaper 
cover story designed to test Joseph’s musical ability to influence 
people. But there was one condition: people should not know who 
he was. Joseph was sure of his musical ability to touch others’ 
hearts and accepted his proposal without hesitation. On a Friday 
morning at rush hour, Joseph took his Stradivarius violin, for 
which he’d paid more than $3 million, and headed to the L’Enfant 
plaza subway stop in Washington, D.C. He set up shop between 
an entrance and an escalator, opened his violin case to take 
donations, seeded it with $20 of his own, and began to perform 
several complex classical pieces expecting himself surrounded by 
many pedestrians in a minute. Over the course of his 
forty­three­minute performance, more than one thousand people 
passed within a few feet of him. Among them, only one stopped 
to listen. As time went by, the violin sound faded and he slowly 
packed up walking away with only $1 earned.
