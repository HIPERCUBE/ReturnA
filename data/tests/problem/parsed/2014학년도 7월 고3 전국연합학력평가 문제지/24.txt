Not many years ago, schoolchildren were taught that carbon 
dioxide is the ①naturally occurring lifeblood of plants, just as 
oxygen is ours. Today, children are more likely to think of 
carbon dioxide as a poison. That’s because the amount of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere ②has increased substantially over the 
past one hundred years, from about 280 parts per million to 
380. But what people don’t know is that the carbon dioxide level 
some 80 million years ago ―back when our mammalian 
ancestors were evolving ―③to be at least 1,000 parts per 
million. In fact, that is the concentration of carbon dioxide you 
regularly breathe if you work in a new energy­efficient office 
building, for ④that is the level established by the engineering 
group that sets standards for heating and ventilation systems. So 
not only ⑤is carbon dioxide plainly not poisonous, but changes 
in carbon dioxide levels don’t necessarily mirror human activity. 
Nor has atmospheric carbon dioxide necessarily been the trigger 
for global warming historically.
