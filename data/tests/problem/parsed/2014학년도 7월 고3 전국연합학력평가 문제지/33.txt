33.  Recalling childhood memories can                  , 
according to a study published in April in the Journal of 
Personality and Social Psychology. In a series of 
experiments done by Francesca Gino and Sreedhari Desai of 
Harvard University, participants were more likely to help 
the experimenters with an extra task, judge immoral 
behavior harshly, and donate money to charity when they 
had actively remembered their childhood. The effect held 
whether the memories were positive or negative ― although, 
notably, the study subjects did not have traumatic histories. 
These recollections seem to summon a heightened sense of 
moral purity. Youngsters may or may not behave especially 
ethically, but childhood tends to connote innocence ― a 
frame of mind that affects behavior. “It’s promising research 
in thinking about ways in which people are following their 
moral compass with very simple interventions,” Gino says.
