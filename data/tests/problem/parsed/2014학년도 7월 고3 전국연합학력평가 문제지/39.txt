On the other hand, many of the germs that live in or 
on the bodies of all animals, including humans, are not 
simply parasitic, but contribute important protective, 
stimulant or nutritional effects.
Whatever the benefit to a virus of a long­lived host, there 
is no guarantee that hosts have mechanisms for increasing 
longevity that the virus could exploit. Nor need host 
longevity be an advantage. ( ① ) The interests of the 
virus depend on its life­cycle strategy, and some viruses 
are only released on the death of the host. ( ② ) In fact, 
many parasites actually force their host to attack other 
potential hosts or to be killed or eaten so that the 
parasites are passed on. ( ③ ) In some ways, this can be 
seen as a form of life extension because removing the 
germs could have drastic, possibly fatal effects on the host. 
( ④ ) Extreme examples include endosymbiont root fungi 
in orchids, or mitochondria in our cells. ( ⑤ ) Without 
them, orchids and humans would not survive. [3점]
