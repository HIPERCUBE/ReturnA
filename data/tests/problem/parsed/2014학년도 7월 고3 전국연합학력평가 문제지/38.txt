38. 
All participants were equally accurate, but the older 
group responded more slowly.
Older adults often take longer to make a decision than 
young adults do. But that does not mean they are any less 
sharp. ( ① ) According to research at Ohio State 
University, the slower response time of older adults has 
more to do with prizing accuracy over speed. ( ② ) In the 
study, published recently in the Journal of Experimental 
Psychology: General, college­age students and adults aged 
60 to 90 performed timed tests of word recognition and 
recall. ( ③ ) When the researchers encouraged them to 
work faster, however, they were able to match the 
youngsters’ speed without significantly sacrificing accuracy. 
( ④ ) “In many simple tasks, the elderly take longer mainly 
because they decide to require more evidence to make their 
decision,”　 says co­author Roger Ratcliff. ( ⑤ ) When an 
older mind faces a task that requires speed, he says, a 
conscious effort to work faster can often do the trick.
