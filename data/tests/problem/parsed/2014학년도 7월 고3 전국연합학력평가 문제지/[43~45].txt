(A) 
My grandfather came from Hungary, and was educated 
in Germany. He was the only one in his family to come 
to the United States. He still had relatives living in 
Europe. When the first World War broke out, he 
lamented the fact that if my uncle, his only son, had to 
go, it would mean that (a) he might fight against his 
cousins.
(B) 
It had gone about a thousand yards when it suddenly 
ground to a halt. The band stopped playing, the crowd 
stopped cheering. Everyone gazed in wonder as the train 
slowly backed up and returned to the station. It seemed an 
eternity until the doors opened and the men started to file 
out. Someone shouted, “It’s the armistice. The war is over.” 
For a moment, nobody moved, but then the people heard 
someone bark orders at the soldiers. My uncle walked down 
the steps and paraded down the street with other soldiers, 
as a returning hero, to be welcomed home by the assembled 
crowd. The next day he returned to (b) his job.

received his draft notice. My grandparents were very upset,

bought them all service pins as gifts, which meant that they 
had a loved one in the service. All the little girls were 
delighted. When the day came for (d) him to leave, his 
whole regiment, in their uniforms, left together from the 
same train station.            * draft: 징병 ** regiment: [군사] 연대

uniforms and boarded the train. The band played and the 
crowd cheered. Although no one noticed, I’m sure my 
grandfather had a tear in (e) his eye for the only son, 
going off to war. The train groaned as if it knew the 
destiny to which it was taking its passengers, but it soon 
began to move. The people still cheering and waving their 
flags, the band still playing, the train slowly departed the 
station.
