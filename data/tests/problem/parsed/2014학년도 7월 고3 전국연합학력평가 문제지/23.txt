23. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
A friend of mine mentioned last week that he once bought a 
Frankies chicken and he discovered after getting home that it 
was all dry and nasty. ① He took it back to the store and 
got an immediate refund. Then he decided to write to Walter 
Robinson, the CEO of Frankies Chickens, and tell ② him that 
he had bought one of his quality chickens and it was all dry 
and nasty. By return mail he got a letter from Walter that 
not only included lengthy apologies and a certificate for a 
free chicken, but that also asked for ③ his help to make sure 
it never happened again by asking a whole list of specific 
questions: Where did he buy it? When? Exactly what was 
wrong? What did ④ he think had happened? What exactly did 
the store say when he returned it? Two days later an 
executive of Frankies Chickens called to make sure ⑤ he had 
received the letter, to make sure that all was well, and to 
ask some more specific questions. My friend will never buy 
anything but Frankies chicken.
