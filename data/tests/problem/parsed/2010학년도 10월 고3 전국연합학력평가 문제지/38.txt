38. Some universities require students to keep a record of
when they met with their supervisor, what was discussed,
and what was the agreed next course of action. For
advanced research programs, such as a Ph.D., keeping this
record up to date is a requirement for progression from one
stage of the program to another. Seeing your supervisor
regularly is one of the best ways of making sure that your
dissertation is of the very highest possible standard. Yet you
would be surprised how many students see their supervisor
as little as possible. Although your supervisor will probably
ask to see you if you have been invisible for a long period,
it is normally up to you to arrange such meetings. You
should do this as regularly as possible whenever you have
something to discuss. * dissertation: 학위 논문
