42. With so much data up on photo‒sharing websites, De
Choudhury and her colleagues developed a simple Web
software, which provides tourists with valuable information.
Say you have three days to spend in New York City. The
program starts by excluding photos from city residents by
only considering photos covering a span of time in a city
shorter than a few weeks. Then it uses the frequency of
different attractions to determine which place tourists find
most popular. And it begins looking at what time each
picture was taken to figure out how long most people spent
at each attraction and how long it took people to get from
one place to another. By collecting all this data, the program
can turn out a detailed itinerary to help travelers make the
most of their limited time. * itinerary: 여행 일정 계획
