During a recent excavation in a very old city,
archaeologists found the remains of a water well about
four meters deep in a stratum, which dates back to about
9,000 years ago.
(A) One possible explanation is that sanitation was already a
problem for the inhabitants of the settlement. As the
settlement grew and population increased, the river might
have been polluted with waste from livestock and people.
(B) Since the site is located near a large river, where
inhabitants could get drinking water, it was a mystery as
to why they needed a well.
(C) The well may have been part of an effort to prevent the
polluted water from becoming a health hazard to the
people of the community. Therefore it may be the oldest
example of a well being dug to gain access to a clean
water source. * stratum: 지층
