Sometimes anonymity in traffic acts as a powerful drug,
with several curious side effects. No one is watching and
no one we know will see us, and the inside of the car
itself becomes a useful place for self‒expression. This
may explain why most people, given the choice, desire a
minimum commute of at least twenty minutes. Drivers
desire this lonely “me time” ― to sing, to feel like a
teenager again, to be temporarily free from the
constricted roles of work and home. One study found that
the car was a favored place for people to cry about
something. According to another study, researchers
installed cameras inside of cars to study drivers. They
report that after only a short time, drivers will “forget
the camera” and begin to do all sorts of things, including
nose picking.
Drivers tend to seek (A) in their own car,
where they feel (B) to express themselves.
(A) (B)
① solitude free
② solitude reluctant
③ company free
④ company compelled
⑤ comfort reluctant

(A)
A little girl lived in a small, very simple, poor house
on a hill. As she grew, she would play in the small
garden and (a) she was able to see over the garden
fence and across the valley to a wonderful house high on
the hill. This house had golden windows, so golden and
shining that the little girl would dream of how magic it
would be to live in a house with golden windows instead
of an ordinary house like hers.
(B)
Although she loved her parents and her family, (b) she
yearned to live in such a golden house and dreamed all
day about how wonderful and exciting it must feel to live
there. When she got to an age when she gained enough
skill and sensibility to go outside her garden fence, she
asked her mother if she could go for a bike ride outside
the gate. After talking the girl out of doing so for a long
time, (c) she finally gave in and allowed her to go,
insisting that she should keep close to the house and not
wander off too far.
(C)
So sad, she didn’t go any further and turned.
Heartbroken, she remounted her bike. As she glanced up,
she was amazed by a sight. There across the valley was
a little house and its windows glistened golden as the
sun shone on the little house. (d) She realized that she
had been living in the golden house. All the love and
care she found in her house was what made her home
the golden house.
(D)
The little girl knew exactly where she was heading.
Down the lane and across the valley, she rode her bike
until she got to the gate of the golden house across on
the other hill. As she dismounted her bike, (e) she
focused on the path that led to the house and then on
the house itself. She was so disappointed as she realized
all the windows were plain and rather dirty, reflecting
nothing other than the sad neglect of the house that
stood abandoned.

[49∼50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
According to a study, the average hotel maid cleans
fifteen rooms a day, and each room takes about thirty
minutes to complete. The maids are walking, bending,
pushing, lifting, carrying, scrubbing, and dusting. What
they’re doing, in short, is exercising. In fact, they are
dramatically exceeding the daily doses of exercise
recommended by health experts. But the maids don’t seem
to recognize what they’re doing as exercise. At the
beginning of the study, sixty‒seven percent of the maids
reported that they didn’t exercise regularly. Then, what is
“exercise”? If we accept the cultural definition of exercise
as something we do on a treadmill in a fitness club, then
the maids’ responses are correct. But our bodies don’t
make a distinction about — a calorie
burned is a calorie burned.
The researchers were curious about what would happen
if the maids were told that they were actually exercising.
One group of maids were told about the benefits of
exercise, and they were told that their daily work was
sufficient to get those benefits. Meanwhile, maids in
another group were also told about the benefits of
exercise, but they weren’t told that their own work was a
good form of exercise. Four weeks later, the maids who
had been told that they were good exercisers had lost an
average of 1.8 pounds. The other maids hadn’t lost any
weight.
