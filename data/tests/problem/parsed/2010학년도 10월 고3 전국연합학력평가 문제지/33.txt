33. For a long time, anthropologists believed that all human
societies would progress through a known series of phases of
evolution; this was the concept of unilineal, or one‒way social
evolution. The stages were Savagery (marked by simple, low‒
population societies with low‒grade technologies), Barbarism
(marked by slightly more complex, medium‒population societies
with medium‒grade technologies), and Civilization (marked by
massive populations and high technologies). But anthropology
and archaeology have shown that this hierarchy just isn’t true.
Modern traditional Arctic people continue to forage for their
daily subsistence and keep their populations low, and their
society has evolved into a full‒blown civilization. Because some
societies actually did go from foraging to farming, you may be
inclined to think that every society should. The truth is that
not all societies progress the same way.
