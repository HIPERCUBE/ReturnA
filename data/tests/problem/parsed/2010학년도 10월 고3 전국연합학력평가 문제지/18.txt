For the past seven years, since our former gym was
destroyed by fire, students have been deprived of adequate
facilities for physical education classes and other activities.
We have had to suspend those classes during the winter. Our
indoor athletic teams have had to travel long distances to get
to practice and to games― this has been inconvenient,
expensive and at times even dangerous. School dances have
had to be held in hired halls, which is a costly practice. The
town Finance Committee assures us we can build a new gym
without seriously affecting our tax rate. For those reasons
and for the well‒being of our children, immediate measures
should be taken.
