34. If you are indecisive and plan to do something about it, you
can take immediate comfort in the fact that indecision is not
necessarily due to ignorance and slow thinking. On the
contrary, it is often thinking of so many things and
consideration of so many doubts that result in the difficulty to
reach and act on a simple decision. The more intelligent you
are, the more you may be inclined to consider rapidly many
factors before making a decision. If you were slow‒witted, you
would have little or no difficulty, for you wouldn’t be able to
think of a variety of possible consequences. Your difficulty may
be that you have acquired the habit of applying to a multitude
of unimportant things the same serious consideration you might
advisedly give to vital matters.
