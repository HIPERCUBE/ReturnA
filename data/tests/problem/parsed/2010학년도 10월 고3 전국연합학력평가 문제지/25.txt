25. The manta is the largest of the rays and can weigh up to
1.5 tons. One of the world’s largest manta ray populations is
found off the southern coast of Mozambique. Around three
quarters of this population have been victims of shark attacks.
But these rays appear to be surviving and in good health
despite these attacks. The reason for the good health of these
rays is that they regularly visit . This is
where small fish feast on imperfections left on the manta. In
this particular reef, yellow butterfly fish have been witnessed
cleaning shark bites on manta rays. In this way, they help treat
the wounds by removing dead and infected flesh from around
the wounds. This could be why the manta rays here have such
remarkable endurance against shark bites. *manta ray: 쥐가오리
