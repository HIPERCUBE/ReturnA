For the past seven years, since our former gym was
destroyed by fire, students have been deprived of adequate
facilities for physical education classes and other activities.
We have had to suspend those classes during the winter. Our
indoor athletic teams have had to travel long distances to get
to practice and to games― this has been inconvenient,
expensive and at times even dangerous. School dances have
had to be held in hired halls, which is a costly practice. The
town Finance Committee assures us we can build a new gym
without seriously affecting our tax rate. For those reasons
and for the well‒being of our children, immediate measures
should be taken.
① 학교 축제 행사 일정을 안내하려고
② 화재 예방 교육의 중요성을 강조하려고
③ 지역 주민의 학교 시설 이용을 권장하려고

19. 밑줄 친 They[they]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Patients wish to be better informed about their illness and
the various treatment options available. ①They have a right
to know what is written about them and can apply to see
their clinical notes. The more involved they are, the more
likely ② they are to adhere to treatment. Doctors also
realize that planning treatment should be a collaborative
exercise with their patients. ③They accept that they need
to address patients’ questions about their illness in some
detail. The information technology explosion has enabled
patients to become much more knowledgeable about medical
matters than ④ they used to be. Sometimes they form firm
views about what treatment ⑤ they wish to receive. These
might or might not accord with the doctors’ own views.
20. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
Wherever the ad is placed, many members of the target
market may miss it, so by increasing the frequency of an
ad, advertisers increase the likelihood ①which members of
the target market will be exposed to it. If advertising is on
television, the more ② frequently a commercial is run, the
more people it will reach. If advertising is on a bulletin
board, the location will affect ③ how many people see the
ad. If it is placed in a high–traffic zone, more people will
see it, and if it is placed in a low–traffic zone, ④ fewer
people will see it. However, ⑤ increasing the frequency of
advertising costs more money, and advertising is most
expensive where it is most effective. Therefore, careful
planning is necessary when allocating funds for advertising.

through the same processes as modern maps. While today’s

If you want to be a professional, look like a professional. I
learned this in my first year of high school from my
baseball coach. ①On our very first day of practice, we were
all eager to begin hitting and throwing the baseball. ② But
on that day, we spent the entire time learning the finer
points of wearing the baseball uniform. ③At the time, I
thought it was a waste of time, but over the years, our
dress set the tone for who we were and we took pride in
our appearance. ④Material of the uniform is yet another
important deciding factor to help you purchase the right
uniform. ⑤That pride carried over to the baseball field and
we consistently won championships and sent many players to
college on athletic scholarships.

A million motorists in our city have to go to an emissions
center every year― take time from work, wait in line, and
pay fifteen or twenty–five dollars― for a test that more than
ninety percent of them don’t need. Car enthusiasts―with
high–powered, high‒polluting sports cars― have been known
to drop a clean engine into their car on the day they get it
tested. Others register their car in a faraway town without
emissions testing. Still others randomly pass the test when
they shouldn’t, because dirty engines sometimes burn cleanly
for short durations. There is little evidence that the city’s
system of inspections makes any difference in air quality.

24. No matter what the purpose or the size, people project
bodily senses into every kind of tool that requires skilled use.
It may come as a surprise to hear construction workers speak
of communion with their big machines, but the physical bonding
they experience is real. One machine operator reported, “You’re
part of the machine. The machine gets indistinguishable from
you.” Likewise, many people embody their cars in the same
way. Think about how you know the size of your car well
enough to park it in a small space or pull it into your garage
without hitting anything. You can’t actually see the car’s outer
dimensions, yet you know the size and shape of your car. At
the moment the car responds instantly to your hand motions
and moves as you operate the steering wheel. It feels like the
car becomes a(n) of your body.
① mirror ② idol ③ fuel
④ decoration ⑤ extension
25. The manta is the largest of the rays and can weigh up to
1.5 tons. One of the world’s largest manta ray populations is
found off the southern coast of Mozambique. Around three
quarters of this population have been victims of shark attacks.
But these rays appear to be surviving and in good health
despite these attacks. The reason for the good health of these
rays is that they regularly visit . This is
where small fish feast on imperfections left on the manta. In
this particular reef, yellow butterfly fish have been witnessed
cleaning shark bites on manta rays. In this way, they help treat
the wounds by removing dead and infected flesh from around
the wounds. This could be why the manta rays here have such
remarkable endurance against shark bites. *manta ray: 쥐가오리
① sleeping shelters ② hunting fields
③ cleaning stations ④ breeding grounds
⑤ hiding places
26. You’ve probably spent hours going through a piece of
creative work that doesn’t quite hang together, wondering what
the weak element is so that you can fix it. But quite often, it’s
the ideas that you’re deeply in love with that are throwing
everything else out of balance. So be brave, take a deep
breath, and . Then see how everything else
stands up. You might be surprised by how even and harmonious
the resulting elements are. If your family will bear it, you can
try this discipline with your meals. Make an apple pie without
any apple in it. Cook a Sunday roast chicken with all the
trimmings─but without the chicken! Suddenly the potatoes,
the gravy, the vegetables will take up more of everyone’s
attention. The whole flavor and atmosphere of the meal will be
different. [3점]
① stick to the original plan
② divide the whole into small pieces
③ recognize the value of everyday life
④ erase the parts that look most important
⑤ consult the experts and seek their advice
27. Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch’i, once led his
troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered his
troops two to one. “Let us light a hundred thousand fires when
our army enters Wei,” suggested Sun Pin, “fifty thousand on
the next day, and only thirty thousand on the third.” On the
third day the Wei general came to think, “I knew the men of
Ch’i were cowards, and after only three days more than half
of them have deserted!” So, the Wei general decided to seize
the moment and move swiftly on the Ch’i camp with a lightly
armed force. Sun Pin’s troops retreated, luring Wei’s army into
a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them.
With the Wei general dead and his forces shattered, Sun Pin
now easily defeated the rest of the enemy. Sun Pin’s strategy
of managed to hit the target.
① annoying the enemy deliberately
② promising his troops a great reward
③ appearing weaker than he actually was
④ making enemies fight among themselves
⑤ providing his soldiers with various weapons
28. Several years ago a physician named Humphrey Osmond was
asked to direct a large hospital in Saskatchewan. One situation
which attracted Osmond’s attention was the newly‒built “model”
female geriatric ward. Everything was neat, clean, and spacious.
The only trouble was that the longer the patients stayed in the
ward, the less they seemed to talk to each other. They were
becoming like the furniture, permanently and silently glued to
the walls at regular intervals between the beds. In addition, they
all seemed depressed. Osmond noticed that the ward, like
railway waiting rooms, was arranged to keep people apart.
Nurses preferred this space arrangement because it was easier
to manage. But Osmond changed it into a different setting, like a
French sidewalk cafe, which tended to . The
results of this rearrangement suggested a solution to the
problem of gradual disengagement and withdrawal of the old
people. * geriatric ward: 노인 병동
① create more profits ② bring people together
③ guarantee private space ④ make people more serious
⑤ limit their family’s visits
29. Many years ago, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was
suffering from a dangerous rumor. Advertisers were being
told that the newspaper was no longer attractive to readers
because it carried too much advertising and too little news.
The Bulletin took immediate action to stop the gossip. How?
The Bulletin clipped from its regular edition all reading
matter on one average day, classified it, and published it as
a book. The book was called One Day. It contained 307
pages― as many as a hard cover book; yet the Bulletin had
printed all this news and feature material on one day and
sold it, not for several dollars, but for a few cents. The
printing of that book dramatized the fact that .
It showed the fact more vividly and impressively than mere
talk or explanation could have done.
① news was not always based on truths
② the company was economically stable
③ sometimes false rumors could cost lives
④ newspapers should be replaced by books
⑤ the paper carried lots of reading material
30. Many factories use dangerous machines that have a bad
habit of hurting fingers or hands that are in the wrong place
at the wrong time. If you’re a factory supervisor, you will
want to make sure this never happens again. How can you
accomplish that? You can post a clear warning sign on the
wall― DANGER: KEEP HANDS CLEAR OF THE MACHINE.
However, the most effective way to prevent such accidents
is to . For instance, you can redesign
the machine so that it can be activated only if two buttons
are pressed at the same time. The buttons are positioned so
that to press both of them you must place your arms high
and wide like the letter “Y”. Through this new design the
workers’ hands are inherently nowhere near the danger zone.
① allow workers more recreational activities
② give workers extra rewards for achieving the goal
③ take action to make a dangerous behavior impossible
④ make workers less tired by reducing the working hours
⑤ educate workers about the safety rules as often as possible

The food receiving area should be kept extremely clean,
since you do not want to contaminate incoming food. A clean
receiving area makes it easier to (A) detect / present this type
of problem. The area should be well lit and properly
ventilated. Excessive heat in the receiving area can quickly
damage delivered goods, especially if they are either
refrigerated or frozen products. Too little light may cause
product defects to go (B) noticed / unnoticed ; therefore, the
receiving area should be well lit. In colder climates, it is
important that the receiving area be warm enough to allow the
receiving clerk to carefully inspect products. The outside dock
area in winter, if the temperature is below freezing, is no
place for an employee to conduct a (C) superficial / thorough

Now more women than ever before have the chance to reach
their potential as athletes. The road for complete acceptance of
women in the sports world, however, has been a ① hard one.
Sports in America emerged in the 19th century as a strictly
②male domain. Women were discouraged from participating in
anything more than recreational activities because of myths
about women being the ③weaker sex, unable physically and
emotionally to handle the pressures and strains of competition.
But beginning in the latter part of the 19th century, women
began to ④ accept these myths, proving that they belonged in
sports and that they could benefit from full participation.　 In
June 2002, America celebrated the 30th　 anniversary of the
passage of Title IX, legislation that ⑤provided opportunities
for thousands of young female athletes to reach their potential
on sports fields around the country.

33. For a long time, anthropologists believed that all human
societies would progress through a known series of phases of
evolution; this was the concept of unilineal, or one‒way social
evolution. The stages were Savagery (marked by simple, low‒
population societies with low‒grade technologies), Barbarism
(marked by slightly more complex, medium‒population societies
with medium‒grade technologies), and Civilization (marked by
massive populations and high technologies). But anthropology
and archaeology have shown that this hierarchy just isn’t true.
Modern traditional Arctic people continue to forage for their
daily subsistence and keep their populations low, and their
society has evolved into a full‒blown civilization. Because some
societies actually did go from foraging to farming, you may be
inclined to think that every society should. The truth is that
not all societies progress the same way.

34. If you are indecisive and plan to do something about it, you
can take immediate comfort in the fact that indecision is not
necessarily due to ignorance and slow thinking. On the
contrary, it is often thinking of so many things and
consideration of so many doubts that result in the difficulty to
reach and act on a simple decision. The more intelligent you
are, the more you may be inclined to consider rapidly many
factors before making a decision. If you were slow‒witted, you
would have little or no difficulty, for you wouldn’t be able to
think of a variety of possible consequences. Your difficulty may
be that you have acquired the habit of applying to a multitude
of unimportant things the same serious consideration you might
advisedly give to vital matters.
① what causes indecisiveness
② benefits of careful thinking
③ characteristics of a decisive person
④ the confidence from profound knowledge
⑤ how to overcome the fear of being rejected

The above table shows the numbers of the Nobel Peace
Prize winners and nominees from 1901 to 2001. ①The table
shows that the least nominations do not necessarily indicate
the least possibility of winning the prize. ②Western Europe
won the most Nobel Peace Prizes as well as the most
nominations. ③Eastern Europe won almost as many
nominations as Latin America while the former won about
twice as many prizes as the latter. ④ International
organizations won the second most Nobel Peace Prizes. ⑤ It is
surprising that the number of Nobel Peace Prizes awarded to
Western Europe was more than that of the prizes awarded to
both North America and Latin America.

There stood a communal water pump, and he saw to it
that the handle of that pump was removed, making it
inoperable.
A British physician‒geographer used a famous map to
confirm his theory that contaminated water was to blame for
the transmission of cholera. ( ① ) When cholera struck
England in 1842, he mapped every new case and every death
in London’s densely populated Soho district, marking each
victim’s residence with a dot. ( ② ) Thousands of people fell
ill in Soho, and more than 500 died. ( ③ ) His evolving map
soon revealed a clustering of casualties around the intersection
where Broad and Lexington Streets met. ( ④ ) Almost
immediately, new cases in the area dropped to zero. ( ⑤ )
This result proved the role of water in the spread of cholera,
pointing the way toward protection against it.

“My veil and scarf, please. Someone might see me,”
Hannah said. “A woman shouldn’t have to hide herself from
the world. Come, we’ll take a stroll,” said Annetje, grinning.
“I don’t want to take a stroll.” Sharp words began to well up
inside her. Annetje loved to tease, to take liberties. “Give
them to me,” demanded Hannah. Annetje took a step back
and burst into a shrill laugh. “Come and get them, then.”
And she ran out into the street. Hannah remained
motionless. Out of the alleyway, Annetje turned right and
disappeared. And there stood Hannah, across town from
home, alone and unescorted, with no covering for her head
and face.

38. Some universities require students to keep a record of
when they met with their supervisor, what was discussed,
and what was the agreed next course of action. For
advanced research programs, such as a Ph.D., keeping this
record up to date is a requirement for progression from one
stage of the program to another. Seeing your supervisor
regularly is one of the best ways of making sure that your
dissertation is of the very highest possible standard. Yet you
would be surprised how many students see their supervisor
as little as possible. Although your supervisor will probably
ask to see you if you have been invisible for a long period,
it is normally up to you to arrange such meetings. You
should do this as regularly as possible whenever you have
something to discuss. * dissertation: 학위 논문
① 논문 지도를 받기 위해 지도 교수를 자주 만나야 한다.
② 인간관계를 맺는 과정에서 능동적으로 행동해야 한다.

④ 목표 달성을 위해 장기적인 안목을 갖는 것이 필요하다.
⑤ 학문 연구에서 자료의 진위 여부를 확인하는 것이 중요하다.
39. A negative response is a most difficult handicap to
overcome. When you have said “No,” all your pride of
personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself.
You may later feel that the “No” was hasty; nevertheless,
there is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a
thing, you feel you must stick to it. When a person says
“No” and really means it, he or she is doing far more than
saying a word of two letters. Hence it is of the very
greatest importance that a person be started in the
affirmative direction. The skillful speaker gets, at the outset,
a number of “Yes” responses. This sets the psychological
process of the listener moving in the affirmative direction.

40. Krzysztof Kieslowski에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
A famous Polish film‒maker, Krzysztof Kieslowski was born
in Warsaw. His childhood was nomadic, because he followed
his father, who was suffering from tuberculosis, from one
sanatorium town to another. His first professional training at
Fireman’s College was short‒lived, inspiring a hatred for
uniforms and discipline. After that, he decided to become a
director but failed his entrance exams to Lodz Film School
two successive years in a row. At his third attempt, he was
finally accepted into the school. It took a while before his
talent was recognized in the West. Camera Buff brought his
name to Western Europe’s film fans’ attention, but it was
only with the Decalogue that his reputation spread through
the general film market. It was with documentaries that
Kieslowski’s career started, so Kieslowski’s movies developed
from his documentaries and documentary devices were used
to enhance and add authenticity to a fictitious plot.

41. Karyenda에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Karyenda, a traditional drum of Burundi, is much more
than just a simple musical instrument. In earlier times, it
was considered such a sacred object that the king
interpreted the messages of the beatings of the Karyenda
and turned them into rules for the kingdom. Major events
for the king were announced through the drums, such as
royal coronations, funerals, and weddings. The drums were
normally kept in drum sanctuaries which were guarded
mainly by Hutu families, and they alone, with the king’s
consent, were allowed to manufacture, play, and keep the
drums. When Burundi gained independence from Belgium in
1962, the Karyenda was the symbol for the national flag. It
was later replaced with three stars after the Republic of
Burundi was established. * coronation: 즉위식

42. With so much data up on photo‒sharing websites, De
Choudhury and her colleagues developed a simple Web
software, which provides tourists with valuable information.
Say you have three days to spend in New York City. The
program starts by excluding photos from city residents by
only considering photos covering a span of time in a city
shorter than a few weeks. Then it uses the frequency of
different attractions to determine which place tourists find
most popular. And it begins looking at what time each
picture was taken to figure out how long most people spent
at each attraction and how long it took people to get from
one place to another. By collecting all this data, the program
can turn out a detailed itinerary to help travelers make the
most of their limited time. * itinerary: 여행 일정 계획

43. Imagine the chips bag you were holding in your hands the
other day could be your next cosmetic holder, purse, or
even belt. You might ask yourself “How?” However, this is
exactly what the community of Palo Solo, Mexico, figured
out. Through recycling the plastic which surrounds your
potato chips, chocolate cookies, and candies, fashionable and
practical products are created. This visionary idea was first
born in an effort to develop the community and have its
members share in the work. At first, a group of mothers
gathered to manufacture everyday articles from waste
materials, using ancient hand‒weaving techniques. The
project since has evolved and what started with four
volunteer mothers has become a cooperative that supports
100 families and their children’s education.

During a recent excavation in a very old city,
archaeologists found the remains of a water well about
four meters deep in a stratum, which dates back to about
9,000 years ago.
(A) One possible explanation is that sanitation was already a
problem for the inhabitants of the settlement. As the
settlement grew and population increased, the river might
have been polluted with waste from livestock and people.
(B) Since the site is located near a large river, where
inhabitants could get drinking water, it was a mystery as
to why they needed a well.
(C) The well may have been part of an effort to prevent the
polluted water from becoming a health hazard to the
people of the community. Therefore it may be the oldest
example of a well being dug to gain access to a clean
water source. * stratum: 지층

Sometimes anonymity in traffic acts as a powerful drug,
with several curious side effects. No one is watching and
no one we know will see us, and the inside of the car
itself becomes a useful place for self‒expression. This
may explain why most people, given the choice, desire a
minimum commute of at least twenty minutes. Drivers
desire this lonely “me time” ― to sing, to feel like a
teenager again, to be temporarily free from the
constricted roles of work and home. One study found that
the car was a favored place for people to cry about
something. According to another study, researchers
installed cameras inside of cars to study drivers. They
report that after only a short time, drivers will “forget
the camera” and begin to do all sorts of things, including
nose picking.
Drivers tend to seek (A) in their own car,
where they feel (B) to express themselves.
(A) (B)
① solitude free
② solitude reluctant
③ company free
④ company compelled
⑤ comfort reluctant

(A)
A little girl lived in a small, very simple, poor house
on a hill. As she grew, she would play in the small
garden and (a) she was able to see over the garden
fence and across the valley to a wonderful house high on
the hill. This house had golden windows, so golden and
shining that the little girl would dream of how magic it
would be to live in a house with golden windows instead
of an ordinary house like hers.
(B)
Although she loved her parents and her family, (b) she
yearned to live in such a golden house and dreamed all
day about how wonderful and exciting it must feel to live
there. When she got to an age when she gained enough
skill and sensibility to go outside her garden fence, she
asked her mother if she could go for a bike ride outside
the gate. After talking the girl out of doing so for a long
time, (c) she finally gave in and allowed her to go,
insisting that she should keep close to the house and not
wander off too far.
(C)
So sad, she didn’t go any further and turned.
Heartbroken, she remounted her bike. As she glanced up,
she was amazed by a sight. There across the valley was
a little house and its windows glistened golden as the
sun shone on the little house. (d) She realized that she
had been living in the golden house. All the love and
care she found in her house was what made her home
the golden house.
(D)
The little girl knew exactly where she was heading.
Down the lane and across the valley, she rode her bike
until she got to the gate of the golden house across on
the other hill. As she dismounted her bike, (e) she
focused on the path that led to the house and then on
the house itself. She was so disappointed as she realized
all the windows were plain and rather dirty, reflecting
nothing other than the sad neglect of the house that
stood abandoned.

According to a study, the average hotel maid cleans
fifteen rooms a day, and each room takes about thirty
minutes to complete. The maids are walking, bending,
pushing, lifting, carrying, scrubbing, and dusting. What
they’re doing, in short, is exercising. In fact, they are
dramatically exceeding the daily doses of exercise
recommended by health experts. But the maids don’t seem
to recognize what they’re doing as exercise. At the
beginning of the study, sixty‒seven percent of the maids
reported that they didn’t exercise regularly. Then, what is
“exercise”? If we accept the cultural definition of exercise
as something we do on a treadmill in a fitness club, then
the maids’ responses are correct. But our bodies don’t
make a distinction about — a calorie
burned is a calorie burned.
The researchers were curious about what would happen
if the maids were told that they were actually exercising.
One group of maids were told about the benefits of
exercise, and they were told that their daily work was
sufficient to get those benefits. Meanwhile, maids in
another group were also told about the benefits of
exercise, but they weren’t told that their own work was a
good form of exercise. Four weeks later, the maids who
had been told that they were good exercisers had lost an
average of 1.8 pounds. The other maids hadn’t lost any
weight.
