There stood a communal water pump, and he saw to it
that the handle of that pump was removed, making it
inoperable.
A British physician‒geographer used a famous map to
confirm his theory that contaminated water was to blame for
the transmission of cholera. ( ① ) When cholera struck
England in 1842, he mapped every new case and every death
in London’s densely populated Soho district, marking each
victim’s residence with a dot. ( ② ) Thousands of people fell
ill in Soho, and more than 500 died. ( ③ ) His evolving map
soon revealed a clustering of casualties around the intersection
where Broad and Lexington Streets met. ( ④ ) Almost
immediately, new cases in the area dropped to zero. ( ⑤ )
This result proved the role of water in the spread of cholera,
pointing the way toward protection against it.
