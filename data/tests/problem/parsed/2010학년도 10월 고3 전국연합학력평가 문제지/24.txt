bodily senses into every kind of tool that requires skilled use.
It may come as a surprise to hear construction workers speak
of communion with their big machines, but the physical bonding
they experience is real. One machine operator reported, “You’re
part of the machine. The machine gets indistinguishable from
you.” Likewise, many people embody their cars in the same
way. Think about how you know the size of your car well
enough to park it in a small space or pull it into your garage
without hitting anything. You can’t actually see the car’s outer
dimensions, yet you know the size and shape of your car. At
the moment the car responds instantly to your hand motions
and moves as you operate the steering wheel. It feels like the
car becomes a(n) of your body.
