(A)
A little girl lived in a small, very simple, poor house
on a hill. As she grew, she would play in the small
garden and (a) she was able to see over the garden
fence and across the valley to a wonderful house high on
the hill. This house had golden windows, so golden and
shining that the little girl would dream of how magic it
would be to live in a house with golden windows instead
of an ordinary house like hers.
(B)
Although she loved her parents and her family, (b) she
yearned to live in such a golden house and dreamed all
day about how wonderful and exciting it must feel to live
there. When she got to an age when she gained enough
skill and sensibility to go outside her garden fence, she
asked her mother if she could go for a bike ride outside
the gate. After talking the girl out of doing so for a long
time, (c) she finally gave in and allowed her to go,
insisting that she should keep close to the house and not
wander off too far.
(C)
So sad, she didn’t go any further and turned.
Heartbroken, she remounted her bike. As she glanced up,
she was amazed by a sight. There across the valley was
a little house and its windows glistened golden as the
sun shone on the little house. (d) She realized that she
had been living in the golden house. All the love and
care she found in her house was what made her home
the golden house.
(D)
The little girl knew exactly where she was heading.
Down the lane and across the valley, she rode her bike
until she got to the gate of the golden house across on
the other hill. As she dismounted her bike, (e) she
focused on the path that led to the house and then on
the house itself. She was so disappointed as she realized
all the windows were plain and rather dirty, reflecting
nothing other than the sad neglect of the house that
stood abandoned.
