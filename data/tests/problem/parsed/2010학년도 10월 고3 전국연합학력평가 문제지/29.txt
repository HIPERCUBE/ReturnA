suffering from a dangerous rumor. Advertisers were being
told that the newspaper was no longer attractive to readers

a book. The book was called One Day. It contained 307
pages― as many as a hard cover book; yet the Bulletin had
printed all this news and feature material on one day and
sold it, not for several dollars, but for a few cents. The
printing of that book dramatized the fact that .
It showed the fact more vividly and impressively than mere
talk or explanation could have done.
① news was not always based on truths
② the company was economically stable
③ sometimes false rumors could cost lives
