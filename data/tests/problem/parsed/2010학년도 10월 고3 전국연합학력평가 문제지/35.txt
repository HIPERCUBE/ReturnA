The above table shows the numbers of the Nobel Peace
Prize winners and nominees from 1901 to 2001. ①The table
shows that the least nominations do not necessarily indicate
the least possibility of winning the prize. ②Western Europe
won the most Nobel Peace Prizes as well as the most
nominations. ③Eastern Europe won almost as many
nominations as Latin America while the former won about
twice as many prizes as the latter. ④ International
organizations won the second most Nobel Peace Prizes. ⑤ It is
surprising that the number of Nobel Peace Prizes awarded to
Western Europe was more than that of the prizes awarded to
both North America and Latin America.
