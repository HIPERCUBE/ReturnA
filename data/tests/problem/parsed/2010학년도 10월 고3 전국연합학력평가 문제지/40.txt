40. Krzysztof Kieslowski에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
A famous Polish film‒maker, Krzysztof Kieslowski was born
in Warsaw. His childhood was nomadic, because he followed
his father, who was suffering from tuberculosis, from one
sanatorium town to another. His first professional training at
Fireman’s College was short‒lived, inspiring a hatred for
uniforms and discipline. After that, he decided to become a
director but failed his entrance exams to Lodz Film School
two successive years in a row. At his third attempt, he was
finally accepted into the school. It took a while before his
talent was recognized in the West. Camera Buff brought his
name to Western Europe’s film fans’ attention, but it was
only with the Decalogue that his reputation spread through
the general film market. It was with documentaries that
Kieslowski’s career started, so Kieslowski’s movies developed
from his documentaries and documentary devices were used
to enhance and add authenticity to a fictitious plot.
