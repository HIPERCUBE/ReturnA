43. Imagine the chips bag you were holding in your hands the
other day could be your next cosmetic holder, purse, or
even belt. You might ask yourself “How?” However, this is
exactly what the community of Palo Solo, Mexico, figured
out. Through recycling the plastic which surrounds your
potato chips, chocolate cookies, and candies, fashionable and
practical products are created. This visionary idea was first
born in an effort to develop the community and have its
members share in the work. At first, a group of mothers
gathered to manufacture everyday articles from waste
materials, using ancient hand‒weaving techniques. The
project since has evolved and what started with four
volunteer mothers has become a cooperative that supports
100 families and their children’s education.
