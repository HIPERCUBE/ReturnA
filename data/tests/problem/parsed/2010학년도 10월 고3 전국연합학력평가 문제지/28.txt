28. Several years ago a physician named Humphrey Osmond was
asked to direct a large hospital in Saskatchewan. One situation
which attracted Osmond’s attention was the newly‒built “model”
female geriatric ward. Everything was neat, clean, and spacious.
The only trouble was that the longer the patients stayed in the
ward, the less they seemed to talk to each other. They were
becoming like the furniture, permanently and silently glued to
the walls at regular intervals between the beds. In addition, they
all seemed depressed. Osmond noticed that the ward, like
railway waiting rooms, was arranged to keep people apart.
Nurses preferred this space arrangement because it was easier
to manage. But Osmond changed it into a different setting, like a
French sidewalk cafe, which tended to . The
results of this rearrangement suggested a solution to the
problem of gradual disengagement and withdrawal of the old
people. * geriatric ward: 노인 병동
