27. Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch’i, once led his
troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered his
troops two to one. “Let us light a hundred thousand fires when
our army enters Wei,” suggested Sun Pin, “fifty thousand on
the next day, and only thirty thousand on the third.” On the
third day the Wei general came to think, “I knew the men of
Ch’i were cowards, and after only three days more than half
of them have deserted!” So, the Wei general decided to seize
the moment and move swiftly on the Ch’i camp with a lightly
armed force. Sun Pin’s troops retreated, luring Wei’s army into
a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them.
With the Wei general dead and his forces shattered, Sun Pin
now easily defeated the rest of the enemy. Sun Pin’s strategy
of managed to hit the target.
