If you want to be a professional, look like a professional. I
learned this in my first year of high school from my
baseball coach. ①On our very first day of practice, we were
all eager to begin hitting and throwing the baseball. ② But
on that day, we spent the entire time learning the finer
points of wearing the baseball uniform. ③At the time, I
thought it was a waste of time, but over the years, our
dress set the tone for who we were and we took pride in
our appearance. ④Material of the uniform is yet another
important deciding factor to help you purchase the right
uniform. ⑤That pride carried over to the baseball field and
we consistently won championships and sent many players to
college on athletic scholarships.
