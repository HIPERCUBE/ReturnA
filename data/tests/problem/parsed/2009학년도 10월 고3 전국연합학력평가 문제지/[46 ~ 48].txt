(A)
Mary and her husband Jim had a dog named “Lucky”.
Lucky was a real character. (a) Whatever struck his
fancy, he would take it to his toy box in the basement.
When something is missing, Mary or Jim would go to
Lucky’s toy box and there the treasure would be, amid all
of Lucky’s other favorite toys. (b) One day, Mary was
diagnosed with having stomach cancer. She had an
operation but she was just sure it was fatal and she was
going to die of this disease.
(B)
From then on, Mary forgot about dying. Instead she and
Lucky began living again, walking further and further
together every day. It’s been twelve years now and Mary
finds herself cancer-free: no trace of cancer has sprung
up again in her stomach. She thinks Lucky is her life
saver. (c) Lucky―He still steals treasures and keeps
them in his toy box. But Mary remains his greatest
treasure.
(C)
When Mary woke for a second, she couldn’t understand
what was wrong. She couldn’t move her head and her
body felt heavy and hot. But panic soon gave way to
laughter when Mary realized the problem. She was
covered, literally blanketed, with every treasure Lucky
owned! (d)While she had slept, the sorrowing dog had
made trip after trip to the basement bringing his beloved
mistress all his favorite things in life. He had covered
her with his love.
(D)
While Mary was away for an operation, Lucky just
drooped, whining and miserable. When Mary came home
after spending two weeks in hospital, Mary was so
exhausted she couldn’t even make it up the steps to her
bedroom. Jim made his wife comfortable on the couch and
left her to nap. (e) Lucky stood watching her but he
didn’t come to her when she called. It made Mary sad but
sleep soon overcame her and she dozed.
