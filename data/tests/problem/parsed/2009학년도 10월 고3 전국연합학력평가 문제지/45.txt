Uranium is a resource in France because electricity is
generated in nuclear power plants. However, uranium is
not a resource to an isolated person living in the remote
Highlands of Irian Jaya. In a similar way, a bicycle is a
resource to an 8-year-old boy living in a city, but it
would be of almost no use to a Highlander who lives in
Irian Jaya. There steep narrow trails with sharp rocks,
crossing creeks and climbing steep mountains, make
using a bicycle impossible. Small sticks are a resource
to Bushmen in South Africa. However, they are of little
use to most urbanized people in the world. For them,
twigs are worthless.
Your (A) of resources varies according to your
(B) .
(A) (B)
① definition climate
② definition culture
③ distribution climate
④ distribution culture
⑤ consumption wealth

(A)
Mary and her husband Jim had a dog named “Lucky”.
Lucky was a real character. (a) Whatever struck his
fancy, he would take it to his toy box in the basement.
When something is missing, Mary or Jim would go to
Lucky’s toy box and there the treasure would be, amid all
of Lucky’s other favorite toys. (b) One day, Mary was
diagnosed with having stomach cancer. She had an
operation but she was just sure it was fatal and she was
going to die of this disease.
(B)
From then on, Mary forgot about dying. Instead she and
Lucky began living again, walking further and further
together every day. It’s been twelve years now and Mary
finds herself cancer-free: no trace of cancer has sprung
up again in her stomach. She thinks Lucky is her life
saver. (c) Lucky―He still steals treasures and keeps
them in his toy box. But Mary remains his greatest
treasure.
(C)
When Mary woke for a second, she couldn’t understand
what was wrong. She couldn’t move her head and her
body felt heavy and hot. But panic soon gave way to
laughter when Mary realized the problem. She was
covered, literally blanketed, with every treasure Lucky
owned! (d)While she had slept, the sorrowing dog had
made trip after trip to the basement bringing his beloved
mistress all his favorite things in life. He had covered
her with his love.
(D)
While Mary was away for an operation, Lucky just
drooped, whining and miserable. When Mary came home
after spending two weeks in hospital, Mary was so
exhausted she couldn’t even make it up the steps to her
bedroom. Jim made his wife comfortable on the couch and
left her to nap. (e) Lucky stood watching her but he
didn’t come to her when she called. It made Mary sad but
sleep soon overcame her and she dozed.

[49 ~ 50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
In 1986, the California raisin growers were expecting a
huge harvest, yet they were beginning to panic. Year by
year, (a) they had seen their sales dropping by one
percent annually. In desperation they thought they
needed to change people’s feelings about raisins. For
most people, raisins were considered lonely and dull.
Dried-up fruits do not give the sensations that most
people associate with feeling good about their lives. The
task was clear: pump a healthy dose into the
shriveled-up fruit. What can (b) they associate to raisins
that would make people really want to buy them?
At the time, an old jazz song was enjoying a national
popularity: “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” Raisin
growers used the chance. (c) They hired innovative
animators. Then (d) they created about thirty little clay
raisin models for the farmers, each with a distinct
personality, to dance to the old tune. In those moments,
the New California Raisins were born. The first ad
campaign of farmers created an instant sensation and
successfully linked the sensations to what (e) they hoped
for. As people watched the advertisement, they could
link strong feelings of fun, humor, and pleasure to the
once boring fruit. The raisin industry was rescued from
its devastating slump in sales to a twenty percent annual
increase.
