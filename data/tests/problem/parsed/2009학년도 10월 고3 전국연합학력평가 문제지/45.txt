Uranium is a resource in France because electricity is
generated in nuclear power plants. However, uranium is
not a resource to an isolated person living in the remote
Highlands of Irian Jaya. In a similar way, a bicycle is a
resource to an 8-year-old boy living in a city, but it
would be of almost no use to a Highlander who lives in
Irian Jaya. There steep narrow trails with sharp rocks,
crossing creeks and climbing steep mountains, make
using a bicycle impossible. Small sticks are a resource
to Bushmen in South Africa. However, they are of little
use to most urbanized people in the world. For them,
twigs are worthless.
