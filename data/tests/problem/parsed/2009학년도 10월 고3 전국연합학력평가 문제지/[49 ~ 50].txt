In 1986, the California raisin growers were expecting a
huge harvest, yet they were beginning to panic. Year by
year, (a) they had seen their sales dropping by one
percent annually. In desperation they thought they
needed to change people’s feelings about raisins. For
most people, raisins were considered lonely and dull.
Dried-up fruits do not give the sensations that most
people associate with feeling good about their lives. The
task was clear: pump a healthy dose into the
shriveled-up fruit. What can (b) they associate to raisins
that would make people really want to buy them?
At the time, an old jazz song was enjoying a national
popularity: “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” Raisin
growers used the chance. (c) They hired innovative
animators. Then (d) they created about thirty little clay
raisin models for the farmers, each with a distinct
personality, to dance to the old tune. In those moments,
the New California Raisins were born. The first ad
campaign of farmers created an instant sensation and
successfully linked the sensations to what (e) they hoped
for. As people watched the advertisement, they could
link strong feelings of fun, humor, and pleasure to the
once boring fruit. The raisin industry was rescued from
its devastating slump in sales to a twenty percent annual
increase.
