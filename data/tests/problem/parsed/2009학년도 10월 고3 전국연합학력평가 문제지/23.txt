23. Recently, a researcher found that has a direct
influence on consumer behavior. In her experiments, participants
were asked to eat ice cream and to judge its taste. Each
experimental participant ate ice cream in the presence of a
confederate, and the confederate was always the first to take
a sample of ice cream. The confederate was either instructed
to eat a large amount or a very modest amount, but the
participants didn’t know about it. As predicted, participants
followed the behavior of the confederate. They ate significantly
more ice cream when the confederate had taken a large
amount relative to when the confederate had taken a small
amount. * confederate: 협력자, 공모자
