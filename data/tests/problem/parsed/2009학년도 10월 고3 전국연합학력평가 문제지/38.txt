38. Investigations have found that library corners were among
the least popular areas in childhood classrooms during free
play periods. In most classrooms, the library corners
consisted of a bookshelf with books put in a disorderly
manner. Frequently the library area was inaccessible or hard
to find. When found, these areas were unattractive and
neglected. The work of creating an accessible library corner
stocked with current selections of children’s literature is
worth the effort, because it is rewarded by children’s
increased interest in reading. It has been found that children
in classrooms with extensive book collections use them fifty
percent more when compared with classrooms where there
were almost no books to be found.
