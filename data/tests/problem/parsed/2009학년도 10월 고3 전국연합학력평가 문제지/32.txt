32. When an eight-lane bridge across the Mississippi River
collapsed, nearly one hundred and fifty people were killed
and injured. In the wake of this disaster, there were calls to
harness technology to avoid similar accidents. Thanks to
strenuous work by engineers, bridge supports could contain a
new kind of material that turns red before a structure
collapses or falls apart. When we humans are injured, we
bruise and our skin changes color. The changed color tells us
where to apply the medicine. The new material is a similar
detection method. The secret behind the color-changing
material is a particular type of molecule. When one bond in
the molecule breaks on impact, the rest of the molecule
turns red. This material can allow damage to the structure
to be easily spotted.
