As a successful entrepreneur, I have always had to meet
the challenges, more important than money or business,
alone. I have had to decide by myself, and always against
tremendous opposition from others. Every great move I have
made in life has been ridiculed and opposed by my friends.
The greatest winnings I have made, in happiness, in money
or content, have been accomplished amid almost universal
scorn. But I have reasoned in this way: The average man is
not always successful. We meet few who attain their goal,
few who are really happy or content. Then why should we
let the majority rule in matters affecting our lives?
