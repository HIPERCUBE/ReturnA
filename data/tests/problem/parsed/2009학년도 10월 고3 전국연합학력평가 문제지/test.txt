This is one of the oldest structures in architectural
history. The first kind of this was probably wood trunks
fitted together, and was used to acquire strategic positions
for survival. This was first used to overcome the difficulties
presented by the terrain, such as valleys or mountains.
People could move up as quickly as possible, which often
meant moving to a place of greater security. A modern form
of this is a mechanically moving device that carries people
between floors of a large building, enabling them to move up
or down without walking. * terrain: 지형

Sometimes a person’s whole life can be changed in an
instant. Elizabeth Blackwell’s life changed one afternoon in
1844 when ① she went to visit a friend who was dying. The
dying woman asked her why she did not think of studying
medicine, since she was smart and healthy. When ② she
reminded her dying friend that there were no women
doctors, the woman sighed and said that if she had been
treated by a “lady doctor,” she might not be dying. Her sick
friend had been so ashamed to mention her internal problems
to a man that ③ she hid her pain for too long. When she
finally sought treatment, it was too late to save her life.
Elizabeth couldn’t get the dying woman’s suggestion out of
her mind. So ④ she decided to devote her life to medicine.
In 1849 ⑤ she became the first woman in the United States
to receive a medical degree.
20. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
Farmers plow more and more fields ① to produce more food
for the increasing population. This increases pressure on our
soil resources. Farmers plow soil to improve ② it for crops.
They turn and loosen the soil, ③ leaving it in the best
condition for farming. However, this process removes the
important plant cover that holds soil particles in place, making
soil ④ defenselessly to wind and water erosion. Sometimes,
the wind blows soil from a plowed field. Soil erosion in many
places occurs at a ⑤much faster rate than the natural
processes of weathering can replace it.

Signs of growth of Islam in the United States, Canada, and
recently in Mexico are evident everywhere. ①Mosques, where
Muslims worship, are being built in neighborhoods where once
only churches or synagogues stood. ②Women who wear scarves
covering their hair according to Islamic customs are now a
common sight in many towns and cities. ③Moreover, Muslim
holidays are gaining official recognition in such places as Los
Angeles, Toronto, and New York. ④ Islam is considered by
many to be an alien culture that can’t possibly have any
relationship with normal Western values. ⑤ In addition, an
increasing number of employers are accommodating the religious
needs of their Muslim workers in the same way they respond
to the needs of their Jewish workers.

23. Recently, a researcher found that has a direct
influence on consumer behavior. In her experiments, participants
were asked to eat ice cream and to judge its taste. Each
experimental participant ate ice cream in the presence of a
confederate, and the confederate was always the first to take
a sample of ice cream. The confederate was either instructed
to eat a large amount or a very modest amount, but the
participants didn’t know about it. As predicted, participants
followed the behavior of the confederate. They ate significantly
more ice cream when the confederate had taken a large
amount relative to when the confederate had taken a small
amount. * confederate: 협력자, 공모자

24. Do you know a teaching approach called “jigsaw”? The
essence of this approach requires students to work together
to master the material to be tested on an upcoming
examination. The end is accomplished by grouping students
into cooperating teams and giving each student only part of
the information necessary to pass the test. Under this
system the students must take turns teaching and helping
one another. Everyone needs each other to do well. When
tried in multiracial classrooms, this approach has generated
impressive results, compared to other classrooms using the
traditional competitive method. This method stimulated
significantly more friendship and less prejudice among racial
groups. This approach to learning has proved to be able to
.
① improve students’ memory
② relieve interracial tension
③ satisfy curiosity for nature
④ motivate interest in drawing
⑤ reduce dependence on parents
25. Many choices faced in life are motivated by economic
concerns, and top among these concerns is what job
opportunity to seek or what kind of career to pursue. The
decision will probably have an immense impact on another
one of life’s major decisions: . Because most
economic and employment opportunities are in urban areas, a
majority of people choose to live and work in the city. Many
are born and raised in the city, and they remain there as
adults. Many others are raised in rural areas but transfer to
the city either because there are few job opportunities in
their area or because they prefer city life.

③ when to retire ④ whom to trust
⑤ how to stay fit
26. A noted scientist, Ellsworth Huntington, concluded from
other men’s work and his own involving people living in
different climates, that climate and temperature have a
definite effect on our mental abilities. He found that cool
weather is much more favorable for creative thinking than
hot weather. The mental abilities of large numbers of people
tend to be lowest in the summer. Spring appears to be the
best period of the year for thinking. One reason may be that
in the spring man’s mental abilities are affected by the same
factors that bring about great changes in nature. Fall is the
next best season, then winter. As for summer, it seems to
be a good time to . [3점]

27. Thinning hair makes a woman look older. When your hair’s
health weakens, it seems your personality is likewise

worked. Sadly, many remedies often make the condition
worse. Many experts advise them to . Until
then, little could be done to solve the problem. Women’s
hair loss can be caused by hormone changes. Other factors
can be stress, poor nutrition, illnesses, frequent hair styling
and many more. Most causes of hair loss, when correctly
identified, can be treated with good results.

On draft day, I sat in my living room and watched the
draft with my family. I thought I would be one of the
players to get drafted in the first round. The first round
concluded and I did not make it. I tried to keep a positive
attitude about my situation. I thought I had a better chance
of being drafted in the second round, still a great
accomplishment. However, this round was quickly over, and
before I knew it, we were halfway through the seventh
round. I saw the puzzled look on my father’s face. “After all
I’ve accomplished as a player and a person, how could they
not draft me?” I asked myself. * draft: 프로 신인 선수 선발

Rip currents are powerful currents of water moving
away from the ① shore. They are the most dangerous
hazard for beach swimmers. If you get caught up in a rip
current, keep your wits about you. Don’t swim ② towards
the shore. You may become tired long before you reach
the beach. The current is too strong, so fighting the
current ③ head-on is like swimming upstream in a river.
Instead, swim ④ straight to the beach. This will get you out
of the strong outward current. If it’s too hard to swim
sideways while you’re being dragged through the water, just
wait until the current carries you past the ⑤ sandbar. The
water will be much calmer there. Once you feel you are out
of the current, turn and swim towards the shore.

The concept of seasonal fruit is starting to fade away, as
consumers are getting offered fruits from all seasons all year
round. Who do you thank for this? The freezer and advanced
packaging. (A) the latest technologies, retailers are
capturing the taste, smell and freshness of just ripe fruits
and bringing them to shoppers throughout the year. For
consumers, this is a fruity delight. These iced packages let
us forget the old days, when we were only limited to fruit
harvested during the season. Industry experts say that frozen
fruits will become more popular and widely consumed as the
global climate change impacts and damages regular fruit
harvests. (B) , high health-consciousness contributes to
the popularity of frozen fruits while people are throwing junk
food, rather turning to frozen healthy snacks.

37. four-o’clock에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Four-o’clocks were favorites with our grandmothers, just
as they are admired by us today. The flowers remain
closed until late afternoon, hence the name four-o’clock.
During a season the plants produce hundreds of blooms,
starting in late summer and continuing until being destroyed
by frost. So with a few plants you can fill every bare
space, say, between the house foundations and the pathway
leading to the backyard. Usually, they self-sow. Otherwise
sow the seeds in a row where they will grow as soon as
danger from frost has passed. If its roots are dug and
stored over winter, they produce plants of great size when
set out in spring. Sometimes several colors of bloom are
found on the same plant.
① 오전에는 꽃망울이 열리지 않는다.
② 늦여름부터 서리가 내릴 때까지 꽃을 피운다.
③ 대개는 스스로 씨를 퍼뜨린다.
④ 뿌리로 번식시키면 생장 능력이 떨어진다.
⑤ 한 포기에서 여러 색깔의 꽃이 피기도 한다.

38. Investigations have found that library corners were among
the least popular areas in childhood classrooms during free
play periods. In most classrooms, the library corners
consisted of a bookshelf with books put in a disorderly
manner. Frequently the library area was inaccessible or hard
to find. When found, these areas were unattractive and
neglected. The work of creating an accessible library corner
stocked with current selections of children’s literature is
worth the effort, because it is rewarded by children’s
increased interest in reading. It has been found that children
in classrooms with extensive book collections use them fifty
percent more when compared with classrooms where there
were almost no books to be found.

⑤ 아이들이 다양한 활동을 하게 하자.
39. Have you ever had a favorite author and found out later
that author wrote books under a different name you knew
nothing about? Pen names are an absolute necessity for
authors who work in more than one genre. This is because
readers of one type of book may be disappointed if they pick
up a novel by their favorite author that is entirely different.
For a writer who writes in only one genre or very similar
genres, however, a pen name can actually be harmful. A pen
name makes it far more difficult for readers to find the
writer. If the genres an author writes in compliment each
other, such as mystery and thriller, assuming a pen name
will only cause him to lose half of his potential readership.

There are also traditional practices outlining what you
should and should not do during an eclipse.
In Nepal, eclipses are traditionally considered bad luck and
many people are already making preparations for any
ill-effects that may accompany the longest total solar
eclipse of this century. ( ① ) In Kathmandu, popular TV
astrology shows are reporting an increase in calls, with
people asking whether the eclipse will mean years of bad
luck and how to avoid it. ( ② ) Basically, eating, drinking
and sleeping are not advised. ( ③ ) Moreover, pregnant
women are told to stay indoors just in case there’s an
adverse effect on their unborn child. ( ④ ) And hospitals
have reported that would-be parents postponed scheduled
caesarean operations, to ensure their children are not born
under bad omens. ( ⑤ ) However, not everyone thinks this
eclipse is bad news; one local airline is scheduled to fly
over Mount Everest to ensure it gets the best view of the
event.

41. Buildings― contrary to popular thought― are not lifeless
objects. From the ruins of Byzantium to the streets of New
York, from the roof of a Chinese pagoda to the Eiffel
Tower, every building tells a story. Think of it: When we
consider history, what we see before us are the buildings. If
we look back to Rome, what we see first is the Colosseum
and the Forum. Standing beside the temples of Greece or
near the circle at Stonehenge, we feel the spirit of the
people who created them; their spirits speak to us across
the history. Great buildings, like great literature or poetry or
music, can tell the story of the human soul.

42. In the 1950s, agricultural scientists around the world
started a campaign known as the green revolution. It was an
attempt to increase available food sources worldwide. The
green revolution helped avoid famine in Asia and increased
crop yields in many different parts of the world. However,
the green revolution had its negative side, too. Fertilizers
and pesticides are dangerous chemicals that cause cancer
and pollute the environment. Also, the cost of the chemicals
and the equipment to harvest more crops was far too
expensive for an average peasant farmer. Consequently,
owners of small farms received little benefit from the
advances in agriculture. In some cases, farmers were forced
off the land by larger agricultural businesses.

② Famine in Some Asian Countries
③ Dangers of Chemicals in Agriculture

It is clear that TV activates an intrinsic response in the
human brain. There is nothing particularly unhealthy with
this response, but it can become problematic. Studies have
been performed to determine how people respond to
television both physiologically and behaviorally.
(A) This is what makes some behavior addictive; it is very
difficult to stop, and it takes control of people’s lives.
This definition seems to apply to television viewers.
(B) These studies show that people feel relaxed, passive, and
less alert while watching television. The feeling of
relaxation ends immediately when the set is turned off.
The feeling of passivity and the diminished level of
alertness, however, persist.
(C) As such, the action of turning on the set is positively
reinforced with the positive feeling of relaxation, but
turning the television off is unpleasant because the feeling
of relaxation is removed while the other negative feelings
persist.

When I was preparing for our third anniversary, I searched
every website that I could find. I started with Star Jewelry,
but I never got a response. Then I found your site among
others. I sent off my set of specifications and was very
surprised to find your response contained so many gem
stones that met my requirements. I found exactly what I
wanted at a great price. I visited Jay Jewelry, Graces and
others and they had no stones that were comparable. All
they had were lower quality ones at twice the price. Thank
you so much for the excellent service and the superb
delivery. My wife Susan would like to add that the stone is
dazzling and she can’t wait to wear it.

Uranium is a resource in France because electricity is
generated in nuclear power plants. However, uranium is
not a resource to an isolated person living in the remote
Highlands of Irian Jaya. In a similar way, a bicycle is a
resource to an 8-year-old boy living in a city, but it
would be of almost no use to a Highlander who lives in
Irian Jaya. There steep narrow trails with sharp rocks,
crossing creeks and climbing steep mountains, make
using a bicycle impossible. Small sticks are a resource
to Bushmen in South Africa. However, they are of little

(A)
Mary and her husband Jim had a dog named “Lucky”.
Lucky was a real character. (a) Whatever struck his
fancy, he would take it to his toy box in the basement.
When something is missing, Mary or Jim would go to
Lucky’s toy box and there the treasure would be, amid all
of Lucky’s other favorite toys. (b) One day, Mary was
diagnosed with having stomach cancer. She had an
operation but she was just sure it was fatal and she was
going to die of this disease.
(B)
From then on, Mary forgot about dying. Instead she and
Lucky began living again, walking further and further
together every day. It’s been twelve years now and Mary
finds herself cancer-free: no trace of cancer has sprung
up again in her stomach. She thinks Lucky is her life
saver. (c) Lucky―He still steals treasures and keeps
them in his toy box. But Mary remains his greatest
treasure.
(C)
When Mary woke for a second, she couldn’t understand
what was wrong. She couldn’t move her head and her
body felt heavy and hot. But panic soon gave way to
laughter when Mary realized the problem. She was
covered, literally blanketed, with every treasure Lucky
owned! (d)While she had slept, the sorrowing dog had
made trip after trip to the basement bringing his beloved
mistress all his favorite things in life. He had covered
her with his love.
(D)
While Mary was away for an operation, Lucky just
drooped, whining and miserable. When Mary came home
after spending two weeks in hospital, Mary was so
exhausted she couldn’t even make it up the steps to her
bedroom. Jim made his wife comfortable on the couch and
left her to nap. (e) Lucky stood watching her but he
didn’t come to her when she called. It made Mary sad but
sleep soon overcame her and she dozed.

In 1986, the California raisin growers were expecting a
huge harvest, yet they were beginning to panic. Year by
year, (a) they had seen their sales dropping by one
percent annually. In desperation they thought they
needed to change people’s feelings about raisins. For
most people, raisins were considered lonely and dull.
Dried-up fruits do not give the sensations that most
people associate with feeling good about their lives. The
task was clear: pump a healthy dose into the
shriveled-up fruit. What can (b) they associate to raisins
that would make people really want to buy them?
At the time, an old jazz song was enjoying a national
popularity: “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” Raisin
growers used the chance. (c) They hired innovative
animators. Then (d) they created about thirty little clay
raisin models for the farmers, each with a distinct
personality, to dance to the old tune. In those moments,
the New California Raisins were born. The first ad
campaign of farmers created an instant sensation and
successfully linked the sensations to what (e) they hoped
for. As people watched the advertisement, they could
link strong feelings of fun, humor, and pleasure to the
once boring fruit. The raisin industry was rescued from
its devastating slump in sales to a twenty percent annual
increase.
