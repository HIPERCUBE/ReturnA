39. Have you ever had a favorite author and found out later
that author wrote books under a different name you knew
nothing about? Pen names are an absolute necessity for
authors who work in more than one genre. This is because
readers of one type of book may be disappointed if they pick
up a novel by their favorite author that is entirely different.
For a writer who writes in only one genre or very similar
genres, however, a pen name can actually be harmful. A pen
name makes it far more difficult for readers to find the
writer. If the genres an author writes in compliment each
other, such as mystery and thriller, assuming a pen name
will only cause him to lose half of his potential readership.
