It is clear that TV activates an intrinsic response in the
human brain. There is nothing particularly unhealthy with
this response, but it can become problematic. Studies have
been performed to determine how people respond to
television both physiologically and behaviorally.
(A) This is what makes some behavior addictive; it is very
difficult to stop, and it takes control of people’s lives.

(B) These studies show that people feel relaxed, passive, and
less alert while watching television. The feeling of
relaxation ends immediately when the set is turned off.
The feeling of passivity and the diminished level of

reinforced with the positive feeling of relaxation, but
turning the television off is unpleasant because the feeling
of relaxation is removed while the other negative feelings
persist.
