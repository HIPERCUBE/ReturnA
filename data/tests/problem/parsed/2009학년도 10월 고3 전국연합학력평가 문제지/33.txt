reference to animals? Black widow spiders are venomous
animals while some frogs are poisonous. You can easily
distinguish them if you understand how they use the toxins.
Venomous animals store toxins internally and release them
through biting or stinging, disabling whatever organism they
bite or sting. Poisonous animals usually secrete toxins through
their skin so that whatever creature bites or touches them is
poisoned. The toxins have different uses. Venomous animals
use toxins to help them capture prey. Poisonous animals use
toxins to defend themselves. The one uses toxins to make
dinner while the other uses toxins not to be dinner.
