Four-o’clocks were favorites with our grandmothers, just
as they are admired by us today. The flowers remain
closed until late afternoon, hence the name four-o’clock.
During a season the plants produce hundreds of blooms,
starting in late summer and continuing until being destroyed
by frost. So with a few plants you can fill every bare
space, say, between the house foundations and the pathway
leading to the backyard. Usually, they self-sow. Otherwise
sow the seeds in a row where they will grow as soon as
danger from frost has passed. If its roots are dug and
stored over winter, they produce plants of great size when
set out in spring. Sometimes several colors of bloom are
found on the same plant.
