Rip currents are powerful currents of water moving
away from the ① shore. They are the most dangerous
hazard for beach swimmers. If you get caught up in a rip
current, keep your wits about you. Don’t swim ② towards
the shore. You may become tired long before you reach
the beach. The current is too strong, so fighting the
current ③ head-on is like swimming upstream in a river.
Instead, swim ④ straight to the beach. This will get you out
of the strong outward current. If it’s too hard to swim
sideways while you’re being dragged through the water, just
wait until the current carries you past the ⑤ sandbar. The
water will be much calmer there. Once you feel you are out
of the current, turn and swim towards the shore.
