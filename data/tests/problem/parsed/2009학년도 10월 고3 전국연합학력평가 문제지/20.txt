Farmers plow more and more fields ① to produce more food
for the increasing population. This increases pressure on our
soil resources. Farmers plow soil to improve ② it for crops.
They turn and loosen the soil, ③ leaving it in the best
condition for farming. However, this process removes the
important plant cover that holds soil particles in place, making
soil ④ defenselessly to wind and water erosion. Sometimes,
the wind blows soil from a plowed field. Soil erosion in many
places occurs at a ⑤much faster rate than the natural
processes of weathering can replace it.
