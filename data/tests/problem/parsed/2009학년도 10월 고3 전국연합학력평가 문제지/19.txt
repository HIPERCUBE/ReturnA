Sometimes a person’s whole life can be changed in an
instant. Elizabeth Blackwell’s life changed one afternoon in
1844 when ① she went to visit a friend who was dying. The
dying woman asked her why she did not think of studying
medicine, since she was smart and healthy. When ② she
reminded her dying friend that there were no women
doctors, the woman sighed and said that if she had been
treated by a “lady doctor,” she might not be dying. Her sick
friend had been so ashamed to mention her internal problems
to a man that ③ she hid her pain for too long. When she
finally sought treatment, it was too late to save her life.
Elizabeth couldn’t get the dying woman’s suggestion out of
her mind. So ④ she decided to devote her life to medicine.
In 1849 ⑤ she became the first woman in the United States
to receive a medical degree.
