42. In the 1950s, agricultural scientists around the world
started a campaign known as the green revolution. It was an
attempt to increase available food sources worldwide. The
green revolution helped avoid famine in Asia and increased
crop yields in many different parts of the world. However,
the green revolution had its negative side, too. Fertilizers
and pesticides are dangerous chemicals that cause cancer
and pollute the environment. Also, the cost of the chemicals
and the equipment to harvest more crops was far too
expensive for an average peasant farmer. Consequently,
owners of small farms received little benefit from the
advances in agriculture. In some cases, farmers were forced
off the land by larger agricultural businesses.
