When I was preparing for our third anniversary, I searched
every website that I could find. I started with Star Jewelry,
but I never got a response. Then I found your site among
others. I sent off my set of specifications and was very
surprised to find your response contained so many gem
stones that met my requirements. I found exactly what I
wanted at a great price. I visited Jay Jewelry, Graces and
others and they had no stones that were comparable. All
they had were lower quality ones at twice the price. Thank
you so much for the excellent service and the superb
delivery. My wife Susan would like to add that the stone is
dazzling and she can’t wait to wear it.
