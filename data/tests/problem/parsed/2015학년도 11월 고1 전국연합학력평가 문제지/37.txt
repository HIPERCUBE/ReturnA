In prehistoric times, humans faced challenges different 
from those they face today.
(A) When confronted with such a threat, the brain would send 
the signal, “Threat!” and the body would respond by 
shooting hormones, such as adrenaline, into the 
bloodstream at lightning speed.
(B) For example, a common challenge for prehistoric man may 
have been to walk outside his cave in the morning and find 
himself face-to-face with a huge, hungry lion. 
(C) That made the body immediately stronger and faster so 
the human could either wrestle the lion or run away very 
fast. When humans either fought or ran away, the physical 
activity would use up the hormones, and the body 
chemistry would quickly return to normal. [3점]
