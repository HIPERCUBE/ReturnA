Nathaniel Adams Cole was born in Alabama on March 17, 
1919. Cole learned piano from his mother, and both he and his 
older brother Eddie became professional musicians by their 
teens. As a teenager Cole organized two musical groups, the 
Rogues of Rhythm and the Royal Dukes. At 15, he dropped out 
of school to become a full-time jazz piano player. After he 
found a job as a pianist at the Century Club in Santa Monica, he 
formed a trio with Oscar Moore and Wesley Prince in 1939. In 
1951, however, the trio officially broke up. After that, Cole 
emerged as a popular solo vocalist. He released more than forty 
albums and contributed to the introduction of “race music” to 
the larger American musical scene.
