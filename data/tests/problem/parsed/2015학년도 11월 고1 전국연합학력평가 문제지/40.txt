Do animals have a sense of fairness? Researchers decided 
to test this by paying dogs for “giving their paw.” Dogs were 
asked repeatedly to give their paw. Researchers measured 
how fast and how many times dogs would give their paw if 
they were not rewarded. Once this baseline level of paw 
giving was established, the researchers had two dogs sit 
next to each other and asked each dog in turn to give a paw. 
Then one of the dogs was given a better reward than the 
other. In response, the dog that was being “paid” less for the 
same work began giving its paw more reluctantly and 
stopped giving its paw sooner. This finding raises the very 
interesting possibility that dogs may have a basic sense of 
fairness, or at least a hatred of inequality.
