21. We have all had the experience of suddenly noticing that a 
source of constant background noise, such as a distant 
jackhammer or music from a store, has just ceased ― yet we 
hadn’t noticed the sound while it was ongoing. Your auditory 
areas were predicting its continuation, moment after moment, 
and as long as the noise didn’t change you paid it no attention. 
By ceasing, it violated your prediction and attracted your 
attention. Here’s a historical example. Right after New York 
City stopped running elevated trains, people called the police in 
the middle of the night claiming that something woke them up. 
They tended to call around the time the trains used to run past 
their apartments.
