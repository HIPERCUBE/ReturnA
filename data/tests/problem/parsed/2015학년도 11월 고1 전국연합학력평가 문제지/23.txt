Storing medications correctly is very important because 
many drugs will become ineffective if they are not stored 
properly. The bathroom medicine cabinet is not a good place to 
keep medicine because the room’s moisture and heat speed up 
the chemical breakdown of drugs. Storing medication in the 
refrigerator is also not a good idea because of the moisture 
inside the unit. Some easily spoiled drugs do require 
refrigeration, but these should be labeled as needing to be kept 
in the refrigerator. Light and air can also affect drugs, but dark 
bottles and air-tight caps can keep these effects to a minimum. 
A closet is probably your best bet for storage of your 
medications,　 as long as you keep them out of the reach of 
children.
