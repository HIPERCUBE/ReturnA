When we discuss the idea of responsibility, we need to make 
a distinction between responsibility and moral responsibility. 
Responsibility is when one takes on a task or burden and 
accepts the associated consequences. (A) , if you 
take on the responsibility of organizing a conference for work, 
then you not only take on the task of organizing the event, but 
you are also taking on the responsibility of its outcome; 
whether it is a success or failure. This is responsibility. Moral 
responsibility, (B) , is responsibility based on one’s 
moral codes. Let’s say that none of the speakers can make the 
conference because of a big snowstorm. You are responsible for 
the success or failure of the conference, but you may not be 
morally responsible for its failure.
