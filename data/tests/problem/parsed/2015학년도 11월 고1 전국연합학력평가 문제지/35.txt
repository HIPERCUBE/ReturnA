People are cautioned not to look at the Sun at the time of a 
solar eclipse because the brightness and the ultraviolet light of 
direct sunlight are damaging to the eyes. ① This good advice is 
often misunderstood by those who think that sunlight is more 
damaging at this special time. ② But staring at the Sun when it 
is high in the sky is harmful whether or not an eclipse occurs. 
③ In fact, staring at the bare Sun is more harmful than when 
part of the Moon blocks it. ④ Direct exposure to ultraviolet 
light can cause some negative effects on the skin. ⑤ The 
reason for special caution at the time of an eclipse is simply 
that more people are interested in looking at the Sun during 
this time.
