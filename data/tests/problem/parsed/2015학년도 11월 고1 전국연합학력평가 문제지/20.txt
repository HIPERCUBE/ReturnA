The fast pace of today’s lifestyle has us piling one thing on 
top of another. But you should know that multitasking doesn’t 
save any time. Very often, multitasking only slows you down, 
contrary to popular belief. Give your whole focus to what 
you’re doing at the moment no matter what it is. While doing 
the laundry, just do the laundry: Listen to the sound of the 
water as it fills the washing machine and feel the clothes in 
your hand. It doesn’t take up any more time than it would when 
done with your phone pressed to your ear. The same applies to 
your work. Focus on one task at a time, and you’ll accomplish 
each task better, and probably faster.
