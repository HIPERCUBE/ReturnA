31. Judgements about flavor are often influenced by predictions 
based on the   of the food. For example, 
strawberry-flavored foods would be expected to be red. 
However, if colored green, because of the association of green 
foods with flavors such as lime, it would be difficult to identify 
the flavor as strawberry unless it was very strong. Color 
intensity also affects flavor perception. A stronger color may 
cause perception of a stronger flavor in a product, even if the 
stronger color is simply due to the addition of more food 
coloring. Texture also can be misleading. A thicker product 
may be perceived as tasting richer or stronger simply because 
it is thicker, and not because the thickening agent affects the 
flavor of the food.
