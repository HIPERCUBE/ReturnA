We can start to help our babies learn to love great foods 
even before they are born. The latest science is uncovering 
fascinating connections between what moms eat while pregnant 
and what foods their babies enjoy after birth. Remarkable, but 
true. Babies in the womb taste, remember, and form 
preferences for what Mom has been eating. Consider a 
fascinating study involving carrot juice. As part of the study, 
one group of pregnant women drank ten ounces of carrot juice 
four times a week for three weeks in a row. Another group of 
women in the study drank water. When their babies were old 
enough to start eating cereal, it was time to look for a 
difference between the groups. An observer who didn’t know to 
which group each baby belonged studied the babies as they ate 
cereal mixed with carrot juice. The babies who           
this earlier experience of tasting carrot juice in the womb 
protested and made unhappy faces when they first tasted the 
juice, whereas the others readily accepted and enjoyed the 
carrot juice in the cereal. There was a dramatic difference 
between those who had sampled carrot juice in the womb and 
those who had not.
