22. You might have heard of such stories of expert intuition: the 
chess master who walks past a street game and announces 
“White mates in three” without stopping, or the physician who 
makes a complex diagnosis after a single glance at a patient. 
Expert intuition strikes us as magical, but it is not. Indeed, 
each of us performs feats of intuitive expertise many times 
each day. Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in 
the first word of a telephone call and recognize as we enter a 
room that we were the subject of the conversation. Our 
everyday intuitive abilities are no less marvelous than the 
striking insights of an experienced chess master or physician
― only more common.
