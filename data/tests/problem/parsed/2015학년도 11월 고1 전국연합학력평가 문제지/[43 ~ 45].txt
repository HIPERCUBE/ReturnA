(A)
Once there were two thieves who worked together. One of 
the thieves, Jeff, would distract people out on the street while 
(a) his friend would sneak into their homes and steal clothes 
from their bedrooms! Socks, shirts, pants, even underwear! 
One day, they were both caught and taken to the judge. “Which 
of you did the stealing?” asked the judge. “Um, I did,” said 
Jeff’s friend. The judge shook his head and pointed to Jeff. 
“And you distracted the people?” 
(B)
“You just distracted people?” said the judge. “By wasting 
their time?” “That’s right.” The judge cleared (b) his throat. 
“All right then, here are your sentences: The one who stole 
the clothes must return them and give each person an extra 
piece of clothing in addition to the ones that he took.” Jeff’s 
friend nodded as his sentence was announced. The judge 
continued, “The other man must go to prison for the next ten 
years.” 
(C)
“What!” cried the lawyer representing Jeff. “But Your Honor! 
I don’t understand! Why would you give such a harsh sentence 
to my client? After all, Jeff just wasted people’s time! (c) He 
never even committed a crime!” The judge replied, “His crime 
was greater! I gave these sentences because your client’s 
partner stole something that could easily be replaced ―
people’s clothes; but your client stole something that can never 
be repaid ― people’s time.” 
(D)
Jeff nodded in response to the question. The judge thought 
for a moment and then said to (d) him, “So, how did you do it? 
Tell me about it.” Jeff smiled, thinking the judge was going to 
let him go since (e) he hadn’t stolen anything. “Well, Your 
Honor, I would ask people about the weather, talk about sports 
scores, and say whatever I could to hold their attention, while 
that man over there took their things. You see, Your Honor, I 
never actually stole anything myself.”
