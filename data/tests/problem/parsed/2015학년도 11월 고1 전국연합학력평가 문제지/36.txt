It is said that in ancient Athens the followers of Plato 
gathered one day to ask themselves the following question: 
“What is a human being?” 
(A) Holding it in his hand, he shouted “Look! I present you 
with a human being.” After the stir had died down, the 
philosophers gathered again and improved their definition. 
A human being, they said, is featherless biped with broad 
nails.
(B) This curious story from the history of early philosophy 
shows the kinds of difficulties philosophers have 
sometimes been faced with when attempting to give 
abstract, general definitions of what it is to be human.
(C) After a great deal of thought, they came up with the 
following answer: “a human being is a featherless biped.” 
Everybody seemed content with this definition until a 
philosopher burst into the lecture hall with a live 
featherless chicken.
