Dear Ms. Franklin,
I am writing regarding your company’s job offer. I 
am very grateful for this opportunity and am strongly 
considering accepting it. However, I have concerns 
regarding your request for an answer by December 1, 
2015. As you know, accepting this offer would require 
moving my family across several states. I have a child 
in elementary school and my wife needs to care for 
her mother who lives here. As a result, I would like to 
ask if you might consider giving an additional week to 
consider your offer. Please let me know if this 
extension can be made. Thank you. 
Sincerely,
Bradley Markle

19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
One day after grocery shopping, I was sitting at the bus stop. 
When the bus arrived, I just hopped on. Not until I got home 
and reached for the house key did I realize that I had left my 
purse on the bench at the bus stop. My heart started to beat 
faster because all my cash for the month was in my purse. 
“How can I get by without the money?” I said to myself. I 
rushed to catch a taxi and headed back to the bus stop. On 
arriving at the bus stop, I started frantically searching for my 
purse. Right at that moment, something caught my eye from 
under the bench ― something familiar. It was my purse, and 
fortunately all my money was still in there. 
① anxious → relieved
② jealous → ashamed
③ excited → disappointed
④ lonely → delighted

20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
The fast pace of today’s lifestyle has us piling one thing on 
top of another. But you should know that multitasking doesn’t 
save any time. Very often, multitasking only slows you down, 
contrary to popular belief. Give your whole focus to what 
you’re doing at the moment no matter what it is. While doing 
the laundry, just do the laundry: Listen to the sound of the 
water as it fills the washing machine and feel the clothes in 
your hand. It doesn’t take up any more time than it would when 
done with your phone pressed to your ear. The same applies to 
your work. Focus on one task at a time, and you’ll accomplish 
each task better, and probably faster.

① 업무 중에는 휴대전화 사용을 자제하라. 
② 틈틈이 비는 시간을 생산적으로 활용하라.
③ 직장일로 인해 집안일을 소홀히 하지 마라.
④ 자신이 하는 일에 대해 확고한 신념을 지녀라. 
⑤ 무슨 일이든 한 번에 한 가지 일에만 집중하라.

21. We have all had the experience of suddenly noticing that a 
source of constant background noise, such as a distant 
jackhammer or music from a store, has just ceased ― yet we 
hadn’t noticed the sound while it was ongoing. Your auditory 
areas were predicting its continuation, moment after moment, 
and as long as the noise didn’t change you paid it no attention. 
By ceasing, it violated your prediction and attracted your 
attention. Here’s a historical example. Right after New York 
City stopped running elevated trains, people called the police in 
the middle of the night claiming that something woke them up. 
They tended to call around the time the trains used to run past 
their apartments.

②　Noises: The Main Cause of Our Stress
③　Why Are Our Predictions Often Wrong?
④　Various Noises We Can Perceive Easily    
⑤　Human Emotions: Deeper than You Think 
22. You might have heard of such stories of expert intuition: the 
chess master who walks past a street game and announces 
“White mates in three” without stopping, or the physician who 
makes a complex diagnosis after a single glance at a patient. 
Expert intuition strikes us as magical, but it is not. Indeed, 
each of us performs feats of intuitive expertise many times 
each day. Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in 
the first word of a telephone call and recognize as we enter a 
room that we were the subject of the conversation. Our 
everyday intuitive abilities are no less marvelous than the 
striking insights of an experienced chess master or physician
― only more common.
① Don’t Make a Phone Call in Anger!
② Intuitive Expertise: Not Only for Experts
③ Collect More Evidence, Be More Intelligent
④ Intuition: A Magician’s Basic Qualification
⑤ Intuition Will Never Beat Experience 
23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Storing medications correctly is very important because 
many drugs will become ineffective if they are not stored 
properly. The bathroom medicine cabinet is not a good place to 
keep medicine because the room’s moisture and heat speed up 
the chemical breakdown of drugs. Storing medication in the 
refrigerator is also not a good idea because of the moisture 
inside the unit. Some easily spoiled drugs do require 
refrigeration, but these should be labeled as needing to be kept 
in the refrigerator. Light and air can also affect drugs, but dark 
bottles and air-tight caps can keep these effects to a minimum. 
A closet is probably your best bet for storage of your 
medications,　 as long as you keep them out of the reach of 
children.
① various purposes of refrigeration
② proper ways of storing medication
③ the importance of timely treatment 
④ benefits of air-tight storage of foods
⑤ the difficulty of developing new medication

The graph above shows the results of a survey that asked 
American e-book readers aged 18 and older to choose all the 
platforms they used for e-book reading. ① Computers were 
the most commonly used platform in 2011, whereas 
e-readers were used the most in 2014. ② Computers were 
also the only platform with its usage decreased, from 42 
percent in 2011 to 29 percent in 2014. ③ In 2014, the 
percentage of e-reader users was three times as high as that 
of computer users. ④ The biggest increase in usage between 
2011 and 2014 was for tablets. ⑤ Among the three platforms 
whose usage increased between the two years, cell phones 
showed the smallest increase.
25. Nathaniel Adams Cole에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
Nathaniel Adams Cole was born in Alabama on March 17, 
1919. Cole learned piano from his mother, and both he and his 
older brother Eddie became professional musicians by their 
teens. As a teenager Cole organized two musical groups, the 
Rogues of Rhythm and the Royal Dukes. At 15, he dropped out 
of school to become a full-time jazz piano player. After he 
found a job as a pianist at the Century Club in Santa Monica, he 
formed a trio with Oscar Moore and Wesley Prince in 1939. In 
1951, however, the trio officially broke up. After that, Cole 
emerged as a popular solo vocalist. He released more than forty 
albums and contributed to the introduction of “race music” to 
the larger American musical scene.

Foraging is a means of searching for wild food resources. 
This is a method ① that has been used for a long time and is 
possibly the longest method of food searching, tracing back to 
thousands of years ago. In the past, people commonly foraged 
for food in forests, riversides, caves, and virtually any place 
where food could possibly ② be found. Most of the foods 
foraged before ③ were root crops, weeds, shrubs, and many 
more. Now, foraging has become a rising trend. People in

Suppose we wish to create a yellow by mixing red and 
green paints. If we mixed the paints together, we would 
(A) succeed / fail in getting the intended result, probably 
getting a reddish color instead. This is because the paints were 
mixed together so that their effects on light interfered with 
each other. But suppose the red were painted as many small 
dots of paint. From a distance, it would look like a solid red. 
Similarly, the green could be painted as many small dots on the 
same paper, never (B) overlapping / separating the red dots. 
From up close the many small red and green dots would be 
seen. From a distance, far enough back so that the individual 
dots could be (C) visible / invisible , the eye would receive a 
mixture of red and green light. The light would look yellow.
(A) (B)　 (C)
① succeed …… overlapping …… visible
② succeed …… separating …… visible
③ fail …… overlapping …… visible
④ fail …… separating …… invisible

“I found my baby sister!” I proudly said, pushing a stroller 
around so that my mother could see the newest member of our 
family whom I had just taken. At that time I was not quite 
three years old, and the toddler was only a few months younger 
than that, with ① her hair tied tightly behind her little head. I 
remember that ② she was smiling up at me. I must have taken

31. Judgements about flavor are often influenced by predictions 
based on the   of the food. For example, 
strawberry-flavored foods would be expected to be red. 
However, if colored green, because of the association of green 
foods with flavors such as lime, it would be difficult to identify 
the flavor as strawberry unless it was very strong. Color 
intensity also affects flavor perception. A stronger color may 
cause perception of a stronger flavor in a product, even if the 
stronger color is simply due to the addition of more food 
coloring. Texture also can be misleading. A thicker product 
may be perceived as tasting richer or stronger simply because 
it is thicker, and not because the thickening agent affects the 
flavor of the food.
① origin ② recipe ③ nutrition

32. While a home provides shelter and a place to gather, it is 
also the safe place where we can express our feelings and 
enjoy some of the most important and meaningful events in our 
lives. Therefore, designing a home is  . 
I strongly believe that a home provides a canvas on which we 
can illustrate who we are; your space should look like you and 
no one else ― even if you are using an interior designer. While 
some designers love a blank slate and the freedom to do 
whatever they want, I prefer to work with clients who have an 
opinion and a story, and I always want the end result to be the 
best possible version of their taste. [3점]

33. Houses in flames, crops stolen, and hasty graves for the 
dead. This was the legacy of Attila’s Huns, sweeping across 
northern Italy and causing massive destruction to the remains 
of the Roman Empire. But they unintentionally left another, 
more positive legacy as well. Refugees from burning cities 
were desperate to find safe refuge. As things got worse, more 
Roman citizens streamed to the wetlands to avoid the mass 
killings and destruction on the mainland. Over the next few 
centuries they transformed the tough surroundings into an 
architectural wonder: Venice! Built out of misfortune, Venice 
eventually turned into one of the richest and most beautiful 
cities in the world. Thus .

34. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
When we discuss the idea of responsibility, we need to make 
a distinction between responsibility and moral responsibility. 
Responsibility is when one takes on a task or burden and 
accepts the associated consequences. (A) , if you 
take on the responsibility of organizing a conference for work, 
then you not only take on the task of organizing the event, but 
you are also taking on the responsibility of its outcome; 
whether it is a success or failure. This is responsibility. Moral 
responsibility, (B) , is responsibility based on one’s 
moral codes. Let’s say that none of the speakers can make the 
conference because of a big snowstorm. You are responsible for 
the success or failure of the conference, but you may not be 
morally responsible for its failure.
(A) (B)
① In addition …… in short
② In addition …… in contrast
③ Likewise …… as a result
④ For example …… in the same way

People are cautioned not to look at the Sun at the time of a 
solar eclipse because the brightness and the ultraviolet light of 
direct sunlight are damaging to the eyes. ① This good advice is 
often misunderstood by those who think that sunlight is more 
damaging at this special time. ② But staring at the Sun when it 
is high in the sky is harmful whether or not an eclipse occurs. 
③ In fact, staring at the bare Sun is more harmful than when 
part of the Moon blocks it. ④ Direct exposure to ultraviolet 
light can cause some negative effects on the skin. ⑤ The 
reason for special caution at the time of an eclipse is simply 
that more people are interested in looking at the Sun during 
this time.

It is said that in ancient Athens the followers of Plato 
gathered one day to ask themselves the following question: 
“What is a human being?” 
(A) Holding it in his hand, he shouted “Look! I present you 
with a human being.” After the stir had died down, the 
philosophers gathered again and improved their definition. 
A human being, they said, is featherless biped with broad 
nails.
(B) This curious story from the history of early philosophy 
shows the kinds of difficulties philosophers have 
sometimes been faced with when attempting to give 
abstract, general definitions of what it is to be human.
(C) After a great deal of thought, they came up with the 
following answer: “a human being is a featherless biped.” 
Everybody seemed content with this definition until a 
philosopher burst into the lecture hall with a live 
featherless chicken.

In prehistoric times, humans faced challenges different 
from those they face today.
(A) When confronted with such a threat, the brain would send 
the signal, “Threat!” and the body would respond by 
shooting hormones, such as adrenaline, into the 
bloodstream at lightning speed.
(B) For example, a common challenge for prehistoric man may 
have been to walk outside his cave in the morning and find 
himself face-to-face with a huge, hungry lion. 
(C) That made the body immediately stronger and faster so 
the human could either wrestle the lion or run away very 
fast. When humans either fought or ran away, the physical 
activity would use up the hormones, and the body 
chemistry would quickly return to normal. [3점]

However, the actual chance of being attacked by a shark is 
very small. 
Fear of sharks has kept many pool swimmers from testing 
the ocean water. ( ① ) Especially, the 1975 blockbuster movie 
Jaws, featuring a series of shark attacks in a small beach 
community, provided vivid images that convinced many people 
that ocean swimming should be left to the big fish. ( ② ) You 
take a greater risk while driving to and from the beach. ( ③ ) 
According to the International Shark Attack File, the low 
number of shark attacks indicates that these big fish do not 
feed on humans by nature. ( ④ ) Most shark attacks are simply 
due to mistaken identity. ( ⑤ ) In 2007, there were 71 reported 
shark attacks on humans worldwide and only one death, which 
is significantly lower than the 2007 death rate for bee stings 
and snake bites.

That may seem like a lot until you consider that the average 
native living in the Amazonas of Venezuela has roughly 1,600 
species, a full third more.
Clearly there is no shortage of bacteria in our gut, which can 
make this next statement a little hard to believe. ( ① ) Our 
gut bacteria belong on the endangered species list. ( ② ) The 
average American adult has approximately 1,200 different 
species of bacteria residing in his or her gut. ( ③ ) Similarly, 
other groups of humans with lifestyles and diets more similar 
to our ancient human ancestors have more varied bacteria in 
their gut than we Americans do. ( ④ ) Why is this happening? 
( ⑤ ) Our overly processed Western diet, overuse of 
antibiotics, and sterilized homes are threatening the health and 
stability of our gut inhabitants. [3점]

Do animals have a sense of fairness? Researchers decided 
to test this by paying dogs for “giving their paw.” Dogs were 
asked repeatedly to give their paw. Researchers measured 
how fast and how many times dogs would give their paw if 
they were not rewarded. Once this baseline level of paw 
giving was established, the researchers had two dogs sit 
next to each other and asked each dog in turn to give a paw. 
Then one of the dogs was given a better reward than the 
other. In response, the dog that was being “paid” less for the 
same work began giving its paw more reluctantly and 
stopped giving its paw sooner. This finding raises the very 
interesting possibility that dogs may have a basic sense of 
fairness, or at least a hatred of inequality.

We can start to help our babies learn to love great foods 
even before they are born. The latest science is uncovering 
fascinating connections between what moms eat while pregnant 
and what foods their babies enjoy after birth. Remarkable, but 
true. Babies in the womb taste, remember, and form 
preferences for what Mom has been eating. Consider a 
fascinating study involving carrot juice. As part of the study, 
one group of pregnant women drank ten ounces of carrot juice 
four times a week for three weeks in a row. Another group of 
women in the study drank water. When their babies were old 
enough to start eating cereal, it was time to look for a 
difference between the groups. An observer who didn’t know to 
which group each baby belonged studied the babies as they ate 
cereal mixed with carrot juice. The babies who           
this earlier experience of tasting carrot juice in the womb 
protested and made unhappy faces when they first tasted the 
juice, whereas the others readily accepted and enjoyed the 
carrot juice in the cereal. There was a dramatic difference 
between those who had sampled carrot juice in the womb and 
those who had not.

(A)
Once there were two thieves who worked together. One of 
the thieves, Jeff, would distract people out on the street while 
(a) his friend would sneak into their homes and steal clothes 
from their bedrooms! Socks, shirts, pants, even underwear! 
One day, they were both caught and taken to the judge. “Which 
of you did the stealing?” asked the judge. “Um, I did,” said 
Jeff’s friend. The judge shook his head and pointed to Jeff. 
“And you distracted the people?” 

(B)
“You just distracted people?” said the judge. “By wasting 
their time?” “That’s right.” The judge cleared (b) his throat. 
“All right then, here are your sentences: The one who stole 
the clothes must return them and give each person an extra 
piece of clothing in addition to the ones that he took.” Jeff’s 
friend nodded as his sentence was announced. The judge 
continued, “The other man must go to prison for the next ten 
years.” 
(C)
“What!” cried the lawyer representing Jeff. “But Your Honor! 
I don’t understand! Why would you give such a harsh sentence 
to my client? After all, Jeff just wasted people’s time! (c) He 
never even committed a crime!” The judge replied, “His crime 
was greater! I gave these sentences because your client’s 
partner stole something that could easily be replaced ―
people’s clothes; but your client stole something that can never 
be repaid ― people’s time.” 
(D)
Jeff nodded in response to the question. The judge thought 
for a moment and then said to (d) him, “So, how did you do it? 
Tell me about it.” Jeff smiled, thinking the judge was going to 
let him go since (e) he hadn’t stolen anything. “Well, Your 
Honor, I would ask people about the weather, talk about sports 
scores, and say whatever I could to hold their attention, while 
that man over there took their things. You see, Your Honor, I 
never actually stole anything myself.”
