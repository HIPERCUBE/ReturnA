34. 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
From a broad range of early cultures, extending back to about 
a million years, natural objects began to be used as tools and 
implements to supplement or enhance the capacities of the 
hand. (A) , the hand is capable of clawing soil to 
dig out an edible root, but a digging stick or clam shell is also 
capable of being grasped to do the job more easily, in a 
sustainable manner, reducing damage to fingers and nails. The 
task is made easier still if a shell is tied with fiber at a right 
angle to the end of a stick, to make a simple hoe. It can then be 
used more effectively in wider circles from an erect working 
position. (B) , the hand can be cupped in order 
to drink water, but a deep shell forms the same shape 
permanently and more effectively to function without leakage 
as a dipper.
