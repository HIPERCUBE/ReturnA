One day a wise old monk heard an impatient pounding on the 
door. ① He opened it and greeted a young man, who said, “I 
have studied with great and wise masters. However, just in 
case there is anything more I need to know, I have come to see 
if ② you can add to my knowledge.” “Very well,” said the monk. 
“Come and have tea, and we will discuss your studies.” When 
the tea was ready, the old man began to pour it into the 
visitor’s cup. When the cup was full, ③ he continued pouring 
until the tea spilled over the side of the cup. The startled man 
jumped back and shouted, “④ You’re a fool who does not even 
know when a cup is full!” The wise man calmly replied, “Just 
like this cup, your mind is so full of ideas that there is no room 
for any more. Come to me with an empty-cup mind, and then 
⑤ you will learn something.”
