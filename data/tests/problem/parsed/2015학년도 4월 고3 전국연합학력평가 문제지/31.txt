31. What does curiosity mean, and why is it so important? We 
think of curiosity as exploration: being inquisitive, seeking to 
learn and understand. Some associate curiosity with being 
nosy. After all, aren’t we being nosy if we are curious about 
another person, asking personal questions? We believe there is 
a difference between the two. Nosy people ask questions and 
proceed to weigh the answers provided. Their intention is not 
to learn about the other person, but to compare, perhaps 
wanting to determine who is better or worse. In contrast, true 
curiosity                               . It is about exploring and 
learning with the goal of greater understanding, which is free 
from setting values. When curious people ask a question, their 
only intention is to better understand, whether it is another 
person, an idea, a place, an origin, or anything that creates an 
interest in further exploration. [3점]
