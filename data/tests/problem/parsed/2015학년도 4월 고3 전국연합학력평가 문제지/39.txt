One explanation for this is that the first words in each list 
created a first impression that respondents used to interpret 
the remaining adjectives. 
There is evidence that when we form impressions of others, 
we pay more attention to our first impressions. This tendency is 
called the ‘primacy effect.’ The primacy effect was documented 
in a famous study conducted by social psychologist Solomon 
Asch. ( ① ) Individuals were asked to evaluate two people 
based on two lists of adjectives. ( ② ) The list for the first 
person had the following adjectives: intelligent, industrious, 
impulsive, critical, stubborn, and envious. ( ③ ) The list for 
the other person had the same adjectives, but in reverse order. 
( ④ ) Although the content was identical, respondents gave 
the first person a more positive evaluation than the second. 
( ⑤ ) In a similar manner, the first impressions we form about 
someone often affect our impression of subsequent perceptions 
of that person.
