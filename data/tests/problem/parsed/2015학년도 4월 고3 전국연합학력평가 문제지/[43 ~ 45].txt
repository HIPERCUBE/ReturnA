(A)
At the age of fourteen, Steven Courage fell from the back 
of a wagon during a blizzard. It took so long to find him that

permanently damaged. When Steven realized his situation, (a) he was very depressed and hopeless. 
(B)
On one occasion, Steven spoke to a large group of soldiers 
who had severe injuries similar to his. Upon entering the 
hall, (b) he began to tell them to stop feeling sorry for 
themselves, which made the soldiers upset. In fact, they

(C)
In time, Steven got over his despair and he wanted to do 
something with his life. He went to the town mayor and asked

at the time, but convinced by his courage and determination, 
(c) he promised to fulfill the request. Over the years Steven 
successfully overcame many obstacles in his life, becoming 
president of one of the largest banks in the country. Because of this, (d) he was often asked to give speeches.

down and started to take off his disability aids to show them 
his permanent injuries. The booing stopped and (e) he had 
their attention. Steven then spoke to them about his injuries 
and how he overcame them. He emphasized taking personal
