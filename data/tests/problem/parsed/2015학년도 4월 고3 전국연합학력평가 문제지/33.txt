33. While we like to think that our habits follow our intentions, 
it’s possible for intention and habit to be completely reversed. 
How the habit started in the first place could be a complete 
accident, but we can then work out our intentions from our 
behavior, as long as there’s no strong reason for that behavior. 
Say I take a walk around the park every afternoon and each 
time I follow a particular route which takes me past a duck 
pond. When asked why I take this route, I might reply that I like 
to watch people feeding the ducks. In reality, I just walked that 
way the first time, completely at random, and saw no reason not 
to do the same the next day. Now, after the habit is established, 
I try to come up with a reason and the ducks spring to mind. I 
end up                                                                               .
