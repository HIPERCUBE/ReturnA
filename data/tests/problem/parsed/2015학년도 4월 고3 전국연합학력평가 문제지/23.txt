23. 다음 글에서 ‘I’가 마지막에 느꼈을 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
One morning, my 5-year-old daughter shook me awake 
excitedly. “A fairy has left you an amazing present,” she 
whispered. “Look!” I reached under my pillow and found a one 
dollar note, torn exactly in half. She said, “The fairy left half a 
dollar for you, and the other half is under daddy’s pillow.” I was 
struck speechless at her unexpected gift. Simultaneously, I 
found myself in a dilemma. Messages about how important it 
was for my daughter to learn the value of currency came 
flooding into my mind. Should I use this opportunity to teach 
her about not wasting money, explaining that a dollar torn in 
half is worthless? Should I try not to discourage her kind 
behavior? My thoughts all came in a rush: Which quality should 
I reinforce? Which behavior should I promote?
