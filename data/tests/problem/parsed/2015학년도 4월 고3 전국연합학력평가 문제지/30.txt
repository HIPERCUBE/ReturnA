30. 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?  [3점]
We’re all told at school that white reflects sunlight and black 
absorbs it, so the ① paler your clothes are, the cooler you’ll be. 
But it’s not quite that simple. In many hot countries, locals 
often wear ② dark colors. Peasants in China and old ladies in 
southern Europe, for instance, traditionally wear black, and 
the Tuareg, the nomadic people of the Sahara, favor indigo 
blue. These clothes are ③ effective because there are two 
thermal processes happening at once. Heat is coming 
downwards from the sun but it is also going outwards from 
the body. Though light clothes are better at ④ reflecting the 
sun’s heat, dark clothes are better at radiating the body’s 
heat. Given that no one born in a hot climate willingly stands 
in direct sunlight, the dark clothing has the ⑤ defect because 
it keeps you cooler when you’re in the shade.
* thermal: 열의, 온도의
