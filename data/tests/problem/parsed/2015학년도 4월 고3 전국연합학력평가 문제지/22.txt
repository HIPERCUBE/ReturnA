Whether or not we can catch up on sleep ― on the weekend, 
say ― is a hotly debated topic among sleep researchers; the 
latest evidence suggests that while it isn’t ideal, it might help. 
When Peter Liu, a UCLA sleep researcher, brought chronically 
sleep-restricted people into the lab for a weekend of sleep 
during which they slept about 10 hours per night, they showed 
improvements in the ability of insulin to process blood sugar. 
That suggests that catch-up sleep may undo some but not all 
of the damage that sleep deprivation causes, which is 
encouraging given how many adults don’t get the hours they 
need each night. Still, Liu isn’t ready to endorse the habit of 
sleeping less and making up for it later. “It’s like telling people 
you only need to eat healthy during the weekends, but during 
the week you can eat whatever you like,” he says.
