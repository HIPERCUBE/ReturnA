Dear Sir or Madam:
I am writing to you regarding a price discrepancy I 
encountered between an item offered in your retail 
store and the same item offered on your website. I 
recently ordered an outfit from your online store, item 
#N4A8-BL. The price listed on the site was $109, 
which was paid by credit card. Please take a look at the 
attached receipt. Three days later, while shopping at 
our local mall, I visited one of your retail shops and 
found the exact same outfit priced at $79. I would like 
to ask for a refund of the price difference. I am assuming 
that this would be a better solution to packing up the 
outfit and shipping it back to you for a full refund.
Sincerely,
Patricia Cavelli

19. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Some of the words we use most frequently are not 
expressive. If someone asked you what you thought of a movie 
or your dinner, you might respond: “It was fine.” Do you mean, 
‘fine’ as in ‘fine wine,’ or ‘fine art?’ Or do you mean, ‘fine’ as in 
‘excellent, good, fine or poor?’ ‘Fine’ can be used to express 
satisfaction or disappointment. There are hundreds of words 
that, like ‘fine,’ express very little meaning. They are fillers. 
Choose words that are more expressive, like ‘great’ or ‘terrific’ 
or ‘wonderful’ if you want to express pleasure, and words like 
‘adequate’ or ‘satisfactory’ if your intent is to communicate that 
the movie or meal was okay, but nothing more. These words 
won’t be misunderstood. 
① 어휘력 향상을 통해 경쟁력을 갖춰라.

⑤ 의미를 분명히 전달할 수 있는 어휘를 사용하라.
20. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Unlike books and paintings, music speaks to us through a 
re-creator, a musician who makes the printed music sound. A 
composition, even a familiar one, can be a new experience each 
time it’s performed. It is the job of the performer to bring life 
to the printed symbols laid out by a composer. Just how loud is 
a chord marked 𝑓? How fast is a section labeled allegro? No 
matter how many specific indications of rhythm, dynamics, 
or accent appear on a page, much is left to the performer. Like 
that of an actor, his or her interpretation is full of subtle 
timings and inflections. Performers project to　 an audience a 
mixture of their own feelings and the composer’s intentions. 
Critics sometimes say about a particularly convincing 
interpretation that a performer is ‘identified’ with a work and 
its composer. That’s how close the relationship can be.
① the benefits of early music education
② the difficulties of making a composition
③ the importance of a composer’s intention
④ the role of a music performer as an interpreter
⑤ the effects of musical signs on music interpretation
21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
People love to tell others what to do; they believe giving 
advice is ‘helpful,’ even if the advice is not requested. Such 
telling worked in the Industrial Era because it was hierarchical 
in structure. This communication style implied the teller 
inherently had valuable information to provide and knew the 
correct solution. In the Information Age, people have more 
equal access to knowledge and, with the help of technology, are 
generally able to find their own solutions. If someone wants 
advice, they will ask for it. In general, telling is no longer well 
received. It can be perceived as lacking in respect, narrowing 
opportunities and shutting down possibilities by implying 
that the individual is incapable of solving a problem. 
① 정보화 시대에는 매체 활용 능력이 필수적이다.
② 남에게 충고하기 전에 자신을 먼저 돌아보아야 한다.
③ 정확한 정보만이 상대방에 대한 정확한 이해를 돕는다.
④ 일방적으로 조언하는 것은 정보화 시대에 더 이상 적절하지 않다. 
⑤ 기술의 발전은 상상 속에서나 가능한 일을 현실로 바꾸어 놓는다.
22. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Whether or not we can catch up on sleep ― on the weekend, 
say ― is a hotly debated topic among sleep researchers; the 
latest evidence suggests that while it isn’t ideal, it might help. 
When Peter Liu, a UCLA sleep researcher, brought chronically 
sleep-restricted people into the lab for a weekend of sleep 
during which they slept about 10 hours per night, they showed 
improvements in the ability of insulin to process blood sugar. 
That suggests that catch-up sleep may undo some but not all 
of the damage that sleep deprivation causes, which is 
encouraging given how many adults don’t get the hours they 
need each night. Still, Liu isn’t ready to endorse the habit of 
sleeping less and making up for it later. “It’s like telling people 
you only need to eat healthy during the weekends, but during 
the week you can eat whatever you like,” he says.

23. 다음 글에서 ‘I’가 마지막에 느꼈을 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
One morning, my 5-year-old daughter shook me awake 
excitedly. “A fairy has left you an amazing present,” she 
whispered. “Look!” I reached under my pillow and found a one 
dollar note, torn exactly in half. She said, “The fairy left half a 
dollar for you, and the other half is under daddy’s pillow.” I was 
struck speechless at her unexpected gift. Simultaneously, I 
found myself in a dilemma. Messages about how important it 
was for my daughter to learn the value of currency came 
flooding into my mind. Should I use this opportunity to teach 
her about not wasting money, explaining that a dollar torn in 
half is worthless? Should I try not to discourage her kind 
behavior? My thoughts all came in a rush: Which quality should 
I reinforce? Which behavior should I promote?
① upset ② amused 
③ ashamed ④ confused 
⑤ interested
 24. James Gibbs에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
James Gibbs is best known for his successful blending of 
Renaissance and Baroque architectural elements into an 
early-18th century Neo-Classicism. He was born in Scotland 
and studied in Rome under the Late Baroque Italian architect 
Carlo Fontana. Returning to England in 1709, he was appointed 
a member of the commission authorized to build 50 churches in 
London. Between 1722 and 1726 Gibbs constructed his most 
famous church, Saint Martin-in-the-Fields, which has a spire 
rather than a dome rising from the roof of the building. Of 
Gibbs’ later works the circular ‘Radcliffe Camera’ library at 
Oxford University is his most ambitious and monumental 
achievement. His architectural style has influenced the 
architecture of churches in England and the United States.

 32. We tend not to notice how many creative tasks benefit from constraints because they are built　in and have become invisible. 
For example, almost all popular music is in 4/4 time, four beats 
in the bar, with the emphasis usually landing on the first beat. 
Tracks are normally three or four minutes in length, contain a 
chorus, and so on. These are just a few constraints of many that 
popular music follows, and yet look at the variation that can be 
achieved. Many songs break these rules, but they often achieve 
their effects because there is a rule to break in the first place. 
Painters, writers, artists, and so on are all influenced by 
previous styles to various degrees and it’s these previous styles 
that provide constraints. The very limitations we impose on 
ourselves can be                                                     　  . [3점]
① the inherent cultural beliefs 
② the resistance to taking risks
③ the seeds of our finest creations
④ the obstacles to our future success
⑤ the stepping stone for music education
33. While we like to think that our habits follow our intentions, 
it’s possible for intention and habit to be completely reversed. 
How the habit started in the first place could be a complete 
accident, but we can then work out our intentions from our 
behavior, as long as there’s no strong reason for that behavior. 
Say I take a walk around the park every afternoon and each 
time I follow a particular route which takes me past a duck 
pond. When asked why I take this route, I might reply that I like 
to watch people feeding the ducks. In reality, I just walked that 
way the first time, completely at random, and saw no reason not 
to do the same the next day. Now, after the habit is established, 
I try to come up with a reason and the ducks spring to mind. I 
end up                                                                               . 
[3점] 
① hiding the intention of my previous behavior
② regretting my unconscious behavior in the past
③ being confused about the reason why I started exercising
④ inferring intention from what was essentially just chance
⑤ getting out of my old habits and forming new ones instead

From a broad range of early cultures, extending back to about 
a million years, natural objects began to be used as tools and 
implements to supplement or enhance the capacities of the 
hand. (A) , the hand is capable of clawing soil to 
dig out an edible root, but a digging stick or clam shell is also 
capable of being grasped to do the job more easily, in a 
sustainable manner, reducing damage to fingers and nails. The 
task is made easier still if a shell is tied with fiber at a right 
angle to the end of a stick, to make a simple hoe. It can then be 
used more effectively in wider circles from an erect working 
position. (B) , the hand can be cupped in order 
to drink water, but a deep shell forms the same shape 
permanently and more effectively to function without leakage 
as a dipper.

35. Enough sunlight falls on Earth to meet our energy needs ten 
thousand times over. However, it’s highly dispersed. ① Various 
technologies already exist to concentrate the sunlight using 
curved mirrors and focus it on tanks of liquid ― usually water 
or oil. ② If you’re lucky enough to live in a sunny part of the 
country, solar heating panels like these are an excellent way to 
heat water for individual homes. ③ They sit on the roof rather 
like a satellite dish and provide baths and showers that are 
satisfyingly hot and guilt-free. ④ However, Earth is not the 
only planet that receives solar radiation. ⑤ Solar heating can 
also be used on a much larger scale, by making the hot liquid 
drive an engine to generate electricity.
36. Food is neither good nor bad in the absolute, though we have 
been taught to recognize it as such. The organ of taste is not 
the tongue, but the brain, a culturally (and therefore 
historically) determined organ through which the criteria for 
evaluations are transmitted and learned. ① Therefore, these 
criteria vary in space and in time. ② What in one era is judged 
positively, in another can change meaning; what in one locale 
is considered tasty, in another can be rejected as disgusting. 
③ Very often times, the failure to detect spoiled or toxic food 
can lead to serious health problems. ④ Definitions of taste 
belong to the cultural heritage of human society. ⑤ As there 
are differing tastes and preferences among different peoples 
and regions of the world, so do tastes and preferences evolve 
over the course of centuries. [3점]

As science moved toward experimentation to prove its 
theories, tools of measurement became vital.
(A) People in the Middle Ages tried to measure the minutes 
and hours of the day with a mechanical clock that used 
gears, wheels, and weights, but these clocks were 
unreliable. Galileo discovered that a pendulum always 
takes the same amount of time to swing whether the swing 
is narrow or wide.
(B) The measurement of time was probably the most 
important of all, but in Galileo’s time, scientists had not 
yet invented a dependable timepiece. Ancient humans 
could measure years, months, and days with the 
movements of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. 
(C) Sixteen years after Galileo’s death, the Dutch scientist 
Christiaan Huygens attached a pendulum to the gears of a 
mechanical clock, and the grandfather clock was born. 
Humans finally knew what time it was, and science had a 
new important tool.

Permission marketing is a term coined by Seth Godin, 
meaning that the customer has given his or her consent to 
receive marketing messages from an organization.
(A) It is no coincidence that they are commonly referred to in 
the negative terms ‘junk mail’ and ‘spam,’ because they are 
unwelcome. All too often the final result is a frustrated 
customer with no intention of buying and a marketer who 
has wasted his budget ― ‘lose-lose.’
(B) As such, the customer is more receptive to the 
organization because the messages are anticipated, 
personal, and relevant. The opposite of permission 
marketing is interruption marketing, which Godin claims, 
can lead to a ‘lose-lose’ situation.
(C) Interruption marketing occurs when the customer receives 
unrequested direct marketing messages, such as direct 
mail, telephone calls, e-mails, and text messages. Godin 
argues that these things often end up wasting the 
customer’s time and therefore lead to frustration. [3점]

One explanation for this is that the first words in each list 
created a first impression that respondents used to interpret 
the remaining adjectives. 
There is evidence that when we form impressions of others, 
we pay more attention to our first impressions. This tendency is 
called the ‘primacy effect.’ The primacy effect was documented 
in a famous study conducted by social psychologist Solomon 
Asch. ( ① ) Individuals were asked to evaluate two people 
based on two lists of adjectives. ( ② ) The list for the first 
person had the following adjectives: intelligent, industrious, 
impulsive, critical, stubborn, and envious. ( ③ ) The list for 
the other person had the same adjectives, but in reverse order. 
( ④ ) Although the content was identical, respondents gave 
the first person a more positive evaluation than the second. 
( ⑤ ) In a similar manner, the first impressions we form about 
someone often affect our impression of subsequent perceptions 
of that person.

In a recent article, psychology professor Patricia Greenfield 
of UCLA discussed some of the problems caused when a test 
designed for one culture is used to test members of a 
different culture. This situation often causes inaccurate test 
results. For instance, she wrote, “When children of Latino 
immigrant parents go to school, their emphasis on 
understanding rather than speaking, on respecting the 
teacher’s authority rather than expressing one’s own 
opinions leads to negative academic assessment.” She 
described a study of parent-teacher conferences in which a 
teacher complained that the children did not speak up and 
equated it to a bad attitude. “Hence a valued mode of 
communication in one culture ― respectful listening ―
becomes the basis for a rather negative evaluation in the 
school setting where self-assertive speaking is the valued 
mode of communication.”

About 20 years ago, a delicate seaweed named Caulerpa 
taxifolia was brought from its native habitat in the Pacific 
Ocean to a zoo in Germany, where it was used to decorate 
saltwater aquarium exhibits, a seemingly harmless action. 
The seaweed was such a success that samples were sent to 
other institutions, including the Oceanographic Museum in 
Monaco. Within about five years of its introduction there, 
an unfortunate accident took place. The seaweed was 
accidentally flushed into the Mediterranean when exhibit 
tanks were cleaned. This might seem harmless, but 
considering it so would ignore the tremendous power of the 
species to act as                  . Once freed in the 
Mediterranean, Caulerpa quickly changed its growth pattern 
and adapted to its new habitat. This may have occurred 
through a mutation or through hybridization with native 
seaweeds. Whatever the exact genetic explanation, today 
Caulerpa grows about six times larger in the Mediterranean 
than it does in its native Pacific Ocean. Over the past two or 
three years, Caulerpa has spread to the Adriatic, and it now 
appears to threaten the entire Mediterranean with its ability 
to choke out competing seaweeds. It grows on rocks, sand, 
and mud. It grows so widely and quickly that it blankets 
competing native seaweeds, excluding them and it appears to 
be toxic to local animals that feed on seaweeds.

(A)
At the age of fourteen, Steven Courage fell from the back 
of a wagon during a blizzard. It took so long to find him that 
he became severely frostbitten. His father took him to the 
hospital. The doctor told him that his son’s body was 
permanently damaged. When Steven realized his situation, (a) he was very depressed and hopeless. 
(B)
On one occasion, Steven spoke to a large group of soldiers 
who had severe injuries similar to his. Upon entering the 
hall, (b) he began to tell them to stop feeling sorry for 
themselves, which made the soldiers upset. In fact, they 
began to boo him. Firmly, Steven walked toward them and told them to get up, fire up, and again be productive. 
(C)
In time, Steven got over his despair and he wanted to do 
something with his life. He went to the town mayor and asked 
for financial support for an education. It was never done 
at the time, but convinced by his courage and determination,
