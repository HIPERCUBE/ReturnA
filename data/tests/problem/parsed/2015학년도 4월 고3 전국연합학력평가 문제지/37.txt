As science moved toward experimentation to prove its 
theories, tools of measurement became vital.
(A) People in the Middle Ages tried to measure the minutes 
and hours of the day with a mechanical clock that used 
gears, wheels, and weights, but these clocks were 
unreliable. Galileo discovered that a pendulum always 
takes the same amount of time to swing whether the swing 
is narrow or wide.
(B) The measurement of time was probably the most 
important of all, but in Galileo’s time, scientists had not 
yet invented a dependable timepiece. Ancient humans 
could measure years, months, and days with the 
movements of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. 
(C) Sixteen years after Galileo’s death, the Dutch scientist 
Christiaan Huygens attached a pendulum to the gears of a 
mechanical clock, and the grandfather clock was born. 
Humans finally knew what time it was, and science had a 
new important tool.
