In a recent article, psychology professor Patricia Greenfield 
of UCLA discussed some of the problems caused when a test 
designed for one culture is used to test members of a 
different culture. This situation often causes inaccurate test 
results. For instance, she wrote, “When children of Latino 
immigrant parents go to school, their emphasis on 
understanding rather than speaking, on respecting the 
teacher’s authority rather than expressing one’s own 
opinions leads to negative academic assessment.” She 
described a study of parent-teacher conferences in which a 
teacher complained that the children did not speak up and 
equated it to a bad attitude. “Hence a valued mode of 
communication in one culture ― respectful listening ―
becomes the basis for a rather negative evaluation in the 
school setting where self-assertive speaking is the valued 
mode of communication.”

About 20 years ago, a delicate seaweed named Caulerpa 
taxifolia was brought from its native habitat in the Pacific 
Ocean to a zoo in Germany, where it was used to decorate 
saltwater aquarium exhibits, a seemingly harmless action. 
The seaweed was such a success that samples were sent to 
other institutions, including the Oceanographic Museum in 
Monaco. Within about five years of its introduction there, 
an unfortunate accident took place. The seaweed was 
accidentally flushed into the Mediterranean when exhibit 
tanks were cleaned. This might seem harmless, but 
considering it so would ignore the tremendous power of the 
species to act as                  . Once freed in the 
Mediterranean, Caulerpa quickly changed its growth pattern 
and adapted to its new habitat. This may have occurred 
through a mutation or through hybridization with native 
seaweeds. Whatever the exact genetic explanation, today 
Caulerpa grows about six times larger in the Mediterranean 
than it does in its native Pacific Ocean. Over the past two or 
three years, Caulerpa has spread to the Adriatic, and it now 
appears to threaten the entire Mediterranean with its ability 
to choke out competing seaweeds. It grows on rocks, sand, 
and mud. It grows so widely and quickly that it blankets 
competing native seaweeds, excluding them and it appears to 
be toxic to local animals that feed on seaweeds.
