Most people don’t realize that both help and harm come from 
within ourselves. Instead, they look to externals, attracted by 
appearances. Wise people, on the other hand, realize that we 
are the source of everything good or bad for us. They therefore 
don’t blame and accuse others. They don’t convince people they 
are worthy, special, or distinguished. If wise people experience 
challenges, they look to themselves; if they are praised by 
others, they quietly smile to themselves, unmoved; if they are 
criticized, they don’t feel the need to defend their name. They 
exercise moderation in everything they do. They know that 
they only have to watch out for themselves and the direction of 
their own desires.
