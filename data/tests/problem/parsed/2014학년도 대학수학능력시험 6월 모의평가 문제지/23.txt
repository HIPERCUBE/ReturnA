Dear Mayor Johnson:
I’m a long-time resident of Pinewood, and I’m really 
concerned about the traffic problem in my neighborhood. 
The traffic has been increasing for the past three years, 
and I’ve seen many near-accidents. I feel the intersection 
at Burton Road and 3rd Street is very dangerous because 
there aren’t any traffic lights. The city should consider 
installing traffic lights as soon as possible. I believe 
that this issue affects the safety of every driver or 
pedestrian who uses that intersection, so it deserves 
immediate attention. Nothing is as important as our 
citizens’ safety, so fixing this issue should be made a top 
priority.
I would appreciate your sincere consideration.
Best regards,
Laura McPherson
