What do you think can make you a good tennis player? 
Suppose there are two different tennis pros giving you tennis 
lessons. The first pro says things like “good shot” and “good 
swing” all the time to encourage you. The second one says 
“good swing” only when you make a good swing. If just 
hearing “good swing” gives you a reward, then you will prefer 
the first instructor. But if what you want is to get better at 
tennis, you will prefer the second instructor. That’s because 
the second instructor’s feedback to you is much more 
informative than the first one’s. You’re not after “good swing” 
rewards; you’re after a better tennis game. So feedback that 
simply makes you feel great will not help you develop tennis 
skills in the long run.
