In the past, many public-sector recreation providers allowed 
people free access or charged for permits to control the 
amount or season for different recreational activities such as 
fishing or horse-riding. However, governments and other 
public agencies are finding that funding to maintain sites and 
facilities, to cope with increased demand on the landscape, is 
becoming difficult to maintain. Opportunities to charge 
visitors for appropriate services to help compensate for these 
costs are being considered as one solution. This is a sensitive 
matter, as free access for all people to the outdoors is a much 
cherished right. There is also an additional dilemma for public 
agencies where recreation facilities are already provided from 
public money, and it could be argued that the taxpayer is 
being charged twice. Thus, care is needed by public bodies to 
ensure that charges are only made for services that are clearly 
additional to the provision of free access.
