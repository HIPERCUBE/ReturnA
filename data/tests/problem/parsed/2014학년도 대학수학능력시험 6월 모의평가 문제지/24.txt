In the nineteenth century, a decisive moment occurred when 
people in advertising and journalism discovered that if they 
framed their stories and appeals with fear, they could capture 
our attention. It is an emotion we find hard to resist or control, 
and so they constantly shifted our focus to new possible 
sources of anxiety: the latest health scare, the new crime 
wave, and endless hazards in the environment of which we 
were not aware. With the increasing sophistication of the 
media and the haunting quality of the imagery, they have been 
able to give us the feeling that we are fragile creatures in an 
environment full of danger― even though we live in a world 
infinitely safer and more predictable than anything our 
ancestors knew. With their help, our anxieties have only 
increased.
