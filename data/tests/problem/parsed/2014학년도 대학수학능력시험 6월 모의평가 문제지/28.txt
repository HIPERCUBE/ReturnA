England’s plan to establish colonies in North America, 
starting in the late sixteenth century, was founded on a 
(A) false / valid idea. It was generally assumed that Virginia, 
the region of the North American continent to which 
England laid claim, would have the same climate as the 
Mediterranean region of Europe, since it lay at similar 
latitudes. As a result, the English hoped that the American 
colonies, once established, would be able to supply 
Mediterranean goods such as olives and fruit and reduce England’s 
(B) dependence / restriction on imports from continental Europe. 
One prospectus claimed that the colonies would provide “the 
wines, fruit and salt of France and Spain ... the silks of Persia 
and Italy.” Similarly, (C) abundant / scarce timber would do 
away with the need to import wood from Scandinavia. In 
short, America was mistakenly expected to be a land of plenty 
that would quickly turn a profit.
