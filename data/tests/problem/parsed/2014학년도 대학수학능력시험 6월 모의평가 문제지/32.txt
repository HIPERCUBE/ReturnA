32. The Rust Belt is notorious for its poor air quality. For 
decades, coal plants, steel production, and auto emissions 
have pumped particulates like sulfate into the atmosphere over 
the eastern U.S. Especially before air quality laws began 
appearing in the 1970s, particulate pollution was behind acid 
rain, respiratory disease, and ozone depletion. But a new study 
from Harvard University suggests that the Rust Belt’s thick 
particulate fog may have helped slow down the effects of 
climate change, particularly when it was thickest. Throughout 
the 20th century, global temperatures have gone up by just 
under one degree Celsius. But in the U.S., eastern and central 
states haven’t seen the same rise. In fact, temperatures there 
actually decreased over the same period. The reason seems to 
be particulate pollution. Instead of trapping warm air in the 
atmosphere like carbon dioxide, fine particles like sulfate 
reflect the sun’s light and heat. They may even group with 
watery cloud droplets, which do the same thing. The effect 
is .
* particulate: 분진, 미립 물질
① an accumulation of carbon dioxide
② a net cooling across entire regions
③ a steep acceleration of global warming
④ a significant improvement in air quality 
⑤ a slow but steady increase in temperatures
