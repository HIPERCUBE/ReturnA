In much of Europe, many businesses close during the month 
of August when people go on vacation. Most Europeans 
believe this is time that they should spend with family or 
engaging in personal activities. The French, in particular, 
value their vacation time and prefer not to work overtime. 
They enjoy the longest vacations of any country in the world; 
French law states that employees must receive a minimum of 
five weeks of vacation a year. German companies appear to be 
moving in this direction as well. Despite the extended free 
time, people of both France and Germany are very productive 
when they work. To Europeans, their vacation time seems 
valuable.
