(A)
Zach was a 14-year-old boy, and he was a good swimmer. 
He advanced to the 100 meter freestyle final. Although there 
were many competitors, Zach knew that the winner should 
be between (a) him and Tony. They were best friends, but 
Zach considered him as his biggest competitor. They both 
were great swimmers and had won an equal number of races.
(B)
To prepare for the race, both Zach and Tony bought a 
specially made swimming suit that could minimize resistance 
against water and help them swim faster. But they found out 
that this type of special suit had not been allowed in previous 
races. Both Zach and Tony asked the swimming coach if 
they could wear it. (b) He said that he would let them know 
before the race.
(C)
On the other hand, Zach’s conscience whispered that a true 
victory comes from fair competition. After a long conflict, 
(c) he finally decided to be honest. He told Tony about the 
suit, and they both joined the race wearing the suits. Tony 
won the race, and Zach congratulated him. This was the 
sweetest second place Zach had ever won.
(D)
Nothing was decided during the morning, but shortly 
before the race, the coach told Zach that (d) he and Tony 
could wear the suit. He asked Zach to tell Tony about it. 
After hearing what his coach said, Zach faced a difficult 
choice. At first, he hesitated to tell (e) his friend about the 
news. He thought that if he did not tell Tony about it, he 
would definitely win the race.
