amount allocated to any other department. ② On the other 
hand, in terms of actual spending, the top two departments 
that spent the most were Marketing and Development. ③ The 
Customer Service and Information Technology departments 
spent the same amount of money, which was 20,000 dollars. 
④ The actual spending by the Administration department was 
less than half the allocated budget. ⑤ The Sales department
