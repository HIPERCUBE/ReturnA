People believe that “good books” are educational and useful 
to academic success. However, it appears that the nature of 
written language itself helps increase academic achievement, 
regardless of a book’s quality. ① Even books that provide 
only pleasure will increase the confidence of students and 
encourage them to try to read more technical materials in 
school. ② Comics, magazines, audiobooks, and topics of 
interest on the Internet are sometimes not considered “real” 
reading materials. ③ Students should try to guess the meaning 
of new words while they read rather than look them up in the 
dictionary. ④ However, these materials let students enjoy the 
pleasure of reading and gain information, literacy skills, and 
more. ⑤ This “light” reading is actually very beneficial 
because it is effortless reading, which improves reading 
fluency.
