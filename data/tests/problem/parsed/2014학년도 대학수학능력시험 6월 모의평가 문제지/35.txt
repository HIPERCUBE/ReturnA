35. As the structures of our world and the conditions of 
certainty have yielded to an avalanche of change, the 
extent of our longing for stable, definitive leadership 
. The fault 
lies not with leadership but rather with ourselves and our 
expectations. In the old days, leaders were supposed to 
make sense of chaos, to make certainty out of doubt, and 
to create positive action plans for the resolution of 
paradoxes. Good leaders straightened things out. Should 
chaos rear its ugly head, the leader was expected to restore 
normality immediately. But chaos is now considered 
normal, paradoxes cannot be resolved, and certainty is 
possible only to the level of high probability. Leadership 
that attempts to deliver in terms of fixing any of these can 
only fail. And that is exactly what is happening. [3점]
