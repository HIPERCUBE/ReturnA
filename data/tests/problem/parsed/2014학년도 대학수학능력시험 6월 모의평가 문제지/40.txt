A narrative is not a myth the first time it is told, but only a 
story or an account. What makes a story a myth is the fact 
that it is received by a given society and that a given society 
participates in its transmission. Obviously, it is difficult to 
determine just when any story becomes a myth, but it is 
clear that a narrative is not a myth when it is first told. The 
intentions of the first narrator and the last narrator can be 
the same, but this still does not give any special status to the 
creator of a myth. It is far more important to realize that the 
intentions of a given society in transmitting a narrative may 
have nothing to do with the purposes of its author. Thus we 
can never identify any individual creator of a myth. So long 
as myth is a collective narrative by definition, the only 
relevant consideration are the mentality and purposes of the 
society for which the myth is a myth.
