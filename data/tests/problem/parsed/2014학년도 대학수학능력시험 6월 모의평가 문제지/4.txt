Dear Mayor Johnson:
I’m a long-time resident of Pinewood, and I’m really 
concerned about the traffic problem in my neighborhood. 
The traffic has been increasing for the past three years, 
and I’ve seen many near-accidents. I feel the intersection 
at Burton Road and 3rd Street is very dangerous because 
there aren’t any traffic lights. The city should consider 
installing traffic lights as soon as possible. I believe 
that this issue affects the safety of every driver or 
pedestrian who uses that intersection, so it deserves 
immediate attention. Nothing is as important as our 
citizens’ safety, so fixing this issue should be made a top 
priority.
I would appreciate your sincere consideration.
Best regards,
Laura McPherson

Everyone would like to assume that their wonderful, 
creative ideas will sell themselves. But as Galileo, Edvard 
Munch, Toni Morrison, Sylvia Plath, and millions of others 
have discovered, they do not. On the contrary, creative ideas 
are usually viewed with suspicion and distrust. Thus, students 
need to learn how to persuade other people of the value of 
their ideas. This selling is part of the practical aspect of 
creative thinking. If students do a science project, it is a good 
idea for them to present it and demonstrate why it makes an 
important contribution. If they develop a plan for a new form 
of government, they should explain why it is better than the 
existing form of government.

④ 학생들은 창의적 생각을 남에게 납득시키는 방법을 배워야 한다.

What do you think can make you a good tennis player? 
Suppose there are two different tennis pros giving you tennis 
lessons. The first pro says things like “good shot” and “good 
swing” all the time to encourage you. The second one says 
“good swing” only when you make a good swing. If just 
hearing “good swing” gives you a reward, then you will prefer 
the first instructor. But if what you want is to get better at 
tennis, you will prefer the second instructor. That’s because 
the second instructor’s feedback to you is much more 
informative than the first one’s. You’re not after “good swing” 
rewards; you’re after a better tennis game. So feedback that 
simply makes you feel great will not help you develop tennis 
skills in the long run.

In much of Europe, many businesses close during the month 
of August when people go on vacation. Most Europeans 
believe this is time that they should spend with family or 
engaging in personal activities. The French, in particular, 
value their vacation time and prefer not to work overtime. 
They enjoy the longest vacations of any country in the world; 
French law states that employees must receive a minimum of 
five weeks of vacation a year. German companies appear to be 
moving in this direction as well. Despite the extended free 
time, people of both France and Germany are very productive 
when they work. To Europeans, their vacation time seems 
valuable.

England’s plan to establish colonies in North America, 
starting in the late sixteenth century, was founded on a 
(A) false / valid idea. It was generally assumed that Virginia, 
the region of the North American continent to which 
England laid claim, would have the same climate as the 
Mediterranean region of Europe, since it lay at similar 
latitudes. As a result, the English hoped that the American 
colonies, once established, would be able to supply 
Mediterranean goods such as olives and fruit and reduce England’s 
(B) dependence / restriction on imports from continental Europe. 
One prospectus claimed that the colonies would provide “the 
wines, fruit and salt of France and Spain ... the silks of Persia 
and Italy.” Similarly, (C) abundant / scarce timber would do 
away with the need to import wood from Scandinavia. In 
short, America was mistakenly expected to be a land of plenty 
that would quickly turn a profit.

As Tom stood on stage at the school play, he could feel the 
watchful eyes of the audience. Being in the spotlight made him 
feel tense. He tried to deliver his lines as best as he could, but 
he could feel his voice shaking. Suddenly, he realized he had 
missed a sentence. Without going back, he went on as though 
nothing had happened. But by the time he finished, his hands 
felt sweaty and his heart was racing. No one commented on his 
mistake― apart from his drama teacher. “Well done,” the 
teacher said. “Acting is like learning to ride a bike. You may 
not get it perfect the first time. You may fall off a few times, 
yet each time you get back on you do it better. Your 
performance may not have been perfect, but it was great.” His 
teacher’s comforting words brought a smile to Tom’s face.

34. It is known that people are extremely limited in the amount 
of information that they can process at any given time. A 
common metaphor in early theories of attention is the concept 
of a bottleneck. This metaphor is especially appealing because 
it matches our understanding about attention. The narrow neck 
of a bottle restricts the flow into or out of the bottle. This kind 
of flow in the narrow passageway is similar to the way people 
process information. In other words, this bottleneck limits the 
of information to which we can pay attention. 
Thus, when one message is currently flowing through a 
bottleneck, the other messages must be left behind. [3점]

35. Many people have pointed out that personal responsibility 
can often be . Consider how often 
you’ve passed someone who is pulled over on the side of the 
road with car trouble. It is easy to justify your failure to help by 
telling yourself someone else will stop. Corporations add 
another layer of complication to the story of reduced personal 
responsibility in group settings because corporations are set up 
to assign legal responsibility to the corporation itself instead of 
to its members. There are other complex organizations in 
which the individual members are often not sure of their impact 
or power to bring about change. In this kind of culture, 
“someone else will do it” is a common excuse.  [3점]

36. Appearance creates the first impression customers have of 
food, and first impressions are important. No matter how 
appealing the taste, an unattractive appearance is hard to 
overlook. As humans, we do “eat with our eyes” because our 
sense of sight is more highly developed than the other senses. 
The sense of sight is so highly developed in humans that 
messages received from other senses are often ignored if they 
conflict with what is seen. Yellow candy is expected to be 
lemon-flavored, and if it is grape-flavored, many people

ice cream tinted with red food coloring seems to have a 
stronger strawberry flavor than one that has no added food 
coloring, even when there is no real difference. [3점]

When plants were first grouped together, it was merely for 
convenience. Even today, plants may be categorized together 
in unnatural groupings in order to make them easier to 
identify. (A) , some wildflower books arrange 
together all white-flowered species or all yellow-flowered 
species. However, such groupings do not reflect natural 
relationships and make it difficult to recognize family 
characteristics. We don’t infer that all persons with red hair 
are more closely related to each other than they are to those 
with dark hair; likewise, all long-haired dogs are not more 
closely related to each other than they are to short-haired 
dogs. Modern botanists, (B) , try to group plants

People believe that “good books” are educational and useful 
to academic success. However, it appears that the nature of 
written language itself helps increase academic achievement, 
regardless of a book’s quality. ① Even books that provide 
only pleasure will increase the confidence of students and 
encourage them to try to read more technical materials in 
school. ② Comics, magazines, audiobooks, and topics of 
interest on the Internet are sometimes not considered “real” 
reading materials. ③ Students should try to guess the meaning 
of new words while they read rather than look them up in the 
dictionary. ④ However, these materials let students enjoy the 
pleasure of reading and gain information, literacy skills, and 
more. ⑤ This “light” reading is actually very beneficial 
because it is effortless reading, which improves reading 
fluency.

But the ones in which he could get up and do things like 
industrial arts, drama, science projects, or P.E. were always 
his favorites.
Jason always seemed to have a tough time in classes, except 
in the ones where he could do something. In the classes in 
which the teachers just stood and talked, or told everyone to 
read, he seemed to get bored and restless. ( ① ) He soon 
realized that he was not a slow or unmotivated learner; he was 
a kinesthetic learner. ( ② ) Once he figured this out, he 
started to use this information to his advantage. ( ③ ) He 
would draw out what he learned from class on notes, posters, 
and doodles. ( ④ ) He would act out things and work with 
other students on projects using role play and drama. ( ⑤ ) 
This helped his learning come alive, and he was less bored. As 
a result, he not only enjoyed school more, but his grades also 
went up.
