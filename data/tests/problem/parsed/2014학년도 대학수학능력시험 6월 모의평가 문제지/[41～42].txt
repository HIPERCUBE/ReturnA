Because the Internet is free space where anybody can post 
anything, it can be full of all sorts of useless data. As a 
result, organized knowledge could easily get corrupted or 
lost in a sea of junk data. For books, there are various filters 
that help readers distinguish between reliable and unreliable 
information. On the Internet, the relation between the 
producer and the consumer of information tends to be direct, 
so nothing protects the consumer from polluted information. 
There are, of course, advantages to the free exchange of 
information, and I do believe any producers of data 
should have the freedom to make them available online. 
However, I am also convinced that users should be 
by intermediary services. 
There need to be some forms of guides and filters provided 
by responsible individuals and organizations. Otherwise, we 
may no longer be able to distinguish between the intellectual 
space of information and a polluted environment of 
meaningless data. Thus, reliable intermediary services will 
be needed in the future.
