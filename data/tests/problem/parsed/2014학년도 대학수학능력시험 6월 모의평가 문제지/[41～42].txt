Carrying capacity is the number of individuals that the 
local resources can sustain. Individuals in a population that 
has exceeded the carrying capacity of its habitat may have 
poor health and suffer from malnutrition because of the 
compromised living conditions. When this happens, the 
weakest individuals may die, or the population as a whole 
may become more vulnerable to further environmental stress 
or disease. Sometimes a large number of individuals in a 
population die as a result of overshooting the carrying 
capacity of their habitat. This is known as a die-off. 
Certain animals and plants have a built-in sense of 
carrying capacity, so that instead of overshooting and having 
a die-off, they remain within the limits of their habitat’s 
ability to support them. Lake trout, for instance, stop 
breeding as prolifically when the population density 
increases too dramatically. Although this is the result of 
individual responses to chemical signals from other trout 
rather than a thought-out response on the part of the trout, 
the result is that population numbers may  
for extended periods. The trout will produce more offspring 
and mature to a reproductive size at a faster rate when 
populations are threatened, such as when aggressive fishing 
takes place. When space and food are scarce, such as when a 
lot of fish are living together in a small pond, the trout 
remain smaller and reproduce more slowly. Experiments 
have shown that no matter what number of lake trout a pond 
is stocked with in the beginning, the population will increase 
until it reaches a particular density, then level off at about the 
same number.
