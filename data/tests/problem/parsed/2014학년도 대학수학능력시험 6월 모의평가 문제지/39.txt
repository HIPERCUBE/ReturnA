in the ones where he could do something. In the classes in

realized that he was not a slow or unmotivated learner; he was 
a kinesthetic learner. ( ② ) Once he figured this out, he 
started to use this information to his advantage. ( ③ ) He 
would draw out what he learned from class on notes, posters, 
and doodles. ( ④ ) He would act out things and work with 
other students on projects using role play and drama. ( ⑤ )

a result, he not only enjoyed school more, but his grades also 
went up.
