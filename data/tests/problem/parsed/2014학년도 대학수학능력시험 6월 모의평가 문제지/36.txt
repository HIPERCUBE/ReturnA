36. When a company comes out with a new product, its 
competitors typically go on the defensive, doing whatever 
they can to (A)  the odds that the offering will eat 
into their sales. Responses might include increasing marketing 
efforts, offering discounts to channel partners, and even 
lobbying for regulations that would hinder the rival’s 
expansion. In many cases, though, such actions are misguided. 
Although the conventional wisdom that a rival’s launch will 
hurt profits is often correct, my research shows that 
companies sometimes see profits increase after a rival’s 
launch. The underlying mechanism is pretty simple: When a 
company comes out with a new product, it often raises the 
prices of its existing products. This might be designed to 
make the new product look (B)  and thus more 
attractive by comparison. As that company adjusts its pricing, 
its competitors can do the same without risking customer 
defections over price. [3점]
