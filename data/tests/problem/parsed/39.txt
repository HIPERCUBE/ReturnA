This hasn’t escaped the attention of some savvy Internet 
retailers and we are therefore starting to see the emergence 
of social shopping sites. 
E-tail is obviously a massive trend but in many ways online 
shopping is still divorced from the real world. ( ① ) Online 
supermarkets are usually just text-based lists of products ―
you can’t walk through the store. ( ②  ) Indeed, despite the 
convenience factor, online shopping has nothing in common with 
its real-world equivalent. ( ③ ) For example, online you 
generally have to know what you’re looking for and most people 
shop alone. ( ④ ) In the real world, however, shopping is

experts. ( ⑤ ) These are a mixture of search engines and 
social networking sites and allow shoppers to browse and buy 
based on other customers’ recommendations.
