bout fifty years ago a Pygmy named Kengo took his first trip 
t of the dense, tropical forests of Africa and onto the open 
ins in the company of an anthropologist.
Rather, because Kengo had lived his entire life in a dense 
jungle that offered no view of the horizon, he had failed to 
learn what most of us take for granted, namely, that things 
look different when they are far away. 
At that time, buffalo appeared in the distance ― small black 
dots against a white sky ― and Kengo surveyed them 
curiously. Finally, he turned to the anthropologist and asked 
what kind of insects they were. 
When he told Kengo that the insects were buffalo, Kengo 
roared with laughter and told the anthropologist not to tell 
such stupid lies. But the anthropologist wasn’t stupid and he 
hadn’t lied.

rson A Concern over the environmental impact of burning 
ssil fuels has helped spur interest in an alternative fuel. As for 
is issue, I strongly believe that we should choose biomass as an 
ernative fuel. Biomass is plant-derived material usable as a 
newable energy source which does not deplete existing 
pplies. It contains almost no sulfur, little ash, and gives off few 
llutants, so it is very clean. Another good point is that it is 
adily available and in large supply because plants are probably 
e of the richest resources in the world. Most of all, biomass 
chnology is simple, so biomass can be burned as easily as coal 
d liquefied even more easily than coal. I believe one day it will 
place fossil fuels.
rson B Some people argue that we should use biomass as 
ernative energy. They insist that biomass fuels are clean, 
adily available, and easily converted into gas or liquid form. 
wever, I think they ignore the fact that biomass has low 
ficiency, resulting in high production costs. One-third to 
o-thirds of energy is lost in most biomass conversion. The 
conversion rates of biomass lead to burning more plants, 
nerating much more carbon dioxide and pollution gases. I am 
nvinced that this fact is strongly against the idea that biomass 
clean energy. The low efficiency also requires substantial 
ounts of land, which will increase the possibility that biomass 
el crops will eventually                                                  .
