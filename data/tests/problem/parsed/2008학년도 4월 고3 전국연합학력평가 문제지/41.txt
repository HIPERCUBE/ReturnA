41. When it comes to buying clothes, shoppers can feel 
overwhelmed by the choices. Now dressing rooms equipped with   A
cameras and interactive displays could lead to intelligent fitting ou
rooms. They connect shoppers to a social fashion network, pla
where they could see themselves and others wearing different 
outfits. In the intelligent fitting room, the shopper sees a mirror (A)
flanked by displays. Directly in front, she sees herself in the 
actual mirror. To the left of the mirror, she sees herself on a 
display wearing the outfit she tried on previously. To the right 
of the mirror, she sees another display showing images of other 
people wearing similar clothes or completely different styles. (B)
This allows her to compare multiple outfits at the same time.
