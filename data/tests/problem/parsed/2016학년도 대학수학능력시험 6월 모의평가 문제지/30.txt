Ellie walked to school in her new shoes. “I like those,” 
Megan whispered. “Cool.” Ellie felt happy. ① She knew

“Bring your books to me if you’ve finished.” Ellie

took a deep breath. “The shop didn’t have black shoes,  
Miss Smith,” ④ she said. Her voice came out in a 
whisper. “The school uniform requires black or dark blue 
shoes,” said Miss Smith. “Report to me in proper shoes, 
please. On Monday.” ⑤ She used her quiet-shout voice 
and Ellie shivered.
