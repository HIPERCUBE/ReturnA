They quickly pick out a whole series of items of the 
same type, making a handful of, say, small screws. 
People make extensive use of searching images. One 
unexpected context is sorting. Suppose you have a bag of 
small hardware ― screws, nails, and so on ― and you 
decide to organize them into little jars. You dump the 
stuff out on a table and begin separating the items into 
coherent groups. ( ① ) It is possible to do this by 
randomly picking up individual objects, one by one, 
identifying each one, and then moving it to the 
appropriate jar. ( ② ) But what most people do is very 
different. ( ③ ) They put them in the jar and then go 
back and do the same for a different kind of item. ( ④ ) 
So the sorting sequence is nonrandom, producing runs of 
items of a single type. ( ⑤ ) It is a faster, more 
efficient technique, and much of the increased efficiency 
is due to the use of searching images. [3점]
