School physical education programs should offer a 
balanced variety of activities that allow young people to 
develop ability in lifetime activities that are personally 
meaningful and enjoyable. A balance should exist in 
any physical education program among team, dual, 
and individual (lifetime) sports. ① Team sports such as 
basketball and soccer provide an opportunity for students 
to develop skills and to enjoy working and competing 
together as a team. ② However, in many school physical 
education programs, team sports dominate the curriculum 
at the expense of various individual and dual sports, like 
tennis, swimming, badminton, and golf. ③ In such cases, 
the students lose the opportunity to develop skills in 
activities that they can participate in throughout their 
adult lives. ④ Baseball, in particular, is one of the most 
popular sports frequently broadcast on TV. ⑤ Only through 
a balanced program of team, dual, and individual sports 
is it possible to develop well-rounded individuals.
