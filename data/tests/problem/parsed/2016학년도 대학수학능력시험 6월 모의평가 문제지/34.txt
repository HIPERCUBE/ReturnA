Problems can be distinguished according to whether 
they are reasonable or unreasonable. Reasonable problems 
are of the kind that can be solved in a step-by-step 
manner. A crossword puzzle is of this nature. Given a 
sufficient vocabulary, the empty spaces can be filled in 
one by one. Unreasonable problems, (A) , cannot be 
treated this way because the task contains some ‘trick’ or 
‘catch’ that must be understood before someone can 
arrive at a solution. This feature frustrates any step-by-step 
process that proceeds without the realization that “things 
aren’t what they seem.” (B) , successful problem 
solving in these cases requires that the person acquire an 
insight into the nature of the trick. Riddles provide 
commonplace instances of such insight problems, such as 
the classic riddle that the Sphinx posed to Oedipus.
(A) (B)
