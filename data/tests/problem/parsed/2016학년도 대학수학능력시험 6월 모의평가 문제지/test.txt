19. 다음 글에 드러난 Gabby의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Stepping up to the microphone, Gabby could feel the sweat 
starting to run down her face and neck. She tried to take a deep 
breath, but couldn’t. As her name was called, Gabby became 
more afraid of speaking before a large audience. Then, she 
suddenly remembered the words of a woman who had gradually 
overcome the same fear: “Fear, rapid heartbeat, quick breathing, 
and sweating are simply the body’s declaration that we are ready 
to fight.” Recalling this, Gabby calmed down and remembered 
clearly what she had to say. Assured, Gabby smiled and started 
to deliver her speech. The words flowed out like water, and 
her beating heart gave her more and more mental strength. 
The performance was successful. She had overcome her fear.
① hopeful → scared ② indifferent → refreshed
③ jealous → delighted ④ anxious → confused
⑤ worried → confident
20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Planning involves only the half of your brain that controls 
your logical thinking. The other intuitive half of your brain 
is left out of this planning process. If you insist on always 
having a plan, you cut yourself off from your intuitive self 
and the inner joy it provides. To break planning addiction, 
allow yourself one freedom. Decide to spend a day exploring 
a park or a neighborhood with curiosity as your only guide. 
The next time you feel attracted to someone, and want to 
introduce yourself, go ahead. You’ll be likely to make a new 
friend. By giving yourself freedom to follow your intuition, 
you develop your sensitivity to your inner voice. You learn to 
hear the quiet messages that can make your life an adventure.
① 내면의 즐거움을 얻기 위해 친구를 많이 사귀어라.
② 학습 계획을 수립할 때는 시간 배분을 적절히 해라. 
③ 사고력 향상을 위해 가능한 한 산책 시간을 늘려라.
④ 새로운 모험을 시작하기 전에 주변 사람들과 상의해라. 
⑤ 계획 수립에 얽매이지만 말고 때로는 직관에 따라 행동해라.

21. Although the Internet seems truly global these days, 
less than half of the world’s population has access to 
it. Some four billion people are still unconnected. This 
spring, IT engineers will begin to shift to the next phase 
in a grand plan to bring the Internet to everyone. Their 
goal is to establish a network of high-altitude balloons 
that will rain 4G LTE signals down to anyone with a 
4G device. Regional telecom companies will transmit the 
signals to the balloons, and then each balloon will relay 
the signals to a ground area many miles in diameter. In 
this way, farmers in remote areas will be able to access 
weather data, and rural children will be able to pursue 
online educations. By the end of the year, the engineers 
aim to have 100 balloons about 13 miles up.
* altitude: 높이, 고도
① Balloons for Weather Forecasting
② Balloons to Connect the World
③ A One-Day Tour in a Balloon
④ Online Education for Farmers
⑤ 4G: The Fastest Connection
22. Inflation can be a major life concern for most people. 
It makes it difficult for households to plan ahead. This is 
because ‘future problems’ concerning inflation often make 
us change our plans for the future. For instance, how 
much should the parents of a newborn start regularly 
saving to pay for her college education? If inflation 
averages two percent, prices roughly double every thirty-six 
years. But if inflation gets up to eight percent, prices 
roughly double every nine years. A Harvard education 
that currently costs $100,000 may therefore end up costing 
half a million dollars for an infant born today. Millions 
of workers who retired with pensions during the 1960s 
and 1970s found that inflation pushed up costs far beyond 
their expected expenses. Many had to reenter the workforce 
just to make ends meet.
① What Causes Inflation? 
② Inflation Affects Future Plans
③ Various Ways to Reduce the Inflation Rate
④ Actual Benefits Exceed Estimated Expenses
⑤ How Quickly Can the Inflation Rate Climb?
23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Tourism is important for more than just vacationing. 
Tourism allows people from different places and cultures 
to come together, and then tourists and host communities 
learn about each other’s differences and similarities. They 
also learn new tastes and ways of thinking, which may 
lead to a better understanding between hosts and tourists. 
Another positive effect of tourism is the aid it provides 
for the survival of a society’s culture, especially the 
culture’s art forms. The opportunity to sell native artworks 
to tourists or perform folk dances for them may encourage 
local artists to preserve traditional art forms. For example, 
Fijians have developed their palm mat and shell jewelry 
crafts into profitable tourist businesses. They also earn 
additional income by performing folk dances and fire 
walking.
① misunderstandings between hosts and tourists
② various ways of creating tourism products 
③ negative effects of cultural exchanges
④ disappearance of traditional cultures
⑤ cultural benefits of tourism

25. 교황 Julius Ⅱ의 무덤에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 
않는 것은? 
The project of creating the tomb of Pope Julius Ⅱ was 
originally given to Michelangelo in 1505, but the tomb 
was not completed until 1545. It was designed by 
Michelangelo himself as the pope requested. The design 
called for some 40 statues, and the tomb was to be a 
giant structure. Just less than a year after the initial work 
on the tomb began, it stopped because of lack of funds. 
When Pope Julius Ⅱ died in 1513, he left money for the 
completion of his tomb, so Michelangelo started work 
again. After some years of carving, he completed Moses, 
one of the most famous statues of the tomb. However, 
the next pope, Leo X, had little interest in continuing the 
project. As time went on, its scale was reduced, and the 
project for the tomb was revised again and again.
① Michelangelo가 디자인했다.
② 자금 부족으로 작업이 중단된 적이 있다.
③ Moses는 무덤의 가장 유명한 조각상 중 하나이다. 
④ 교황 Leo X는 프로젝트를 지속하는 것에 관심이 많았다. 
⑤ 프로젝트는 여러 차례 수정되었다.

An independent artist is probably the one ① who lives 
closest to an unbounded creative situation. Many artists 
have considerable freedom from external requirements 
about what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and why. 
At the same time, however, we know that artists usually 
limit themselves quite ② forcefully by choice of material 
and form of expression. To make the choice to express a 
feeling by carving a specific form from a rock, without 
the use of high technology or colors, ③ restricting the 
artist significantly. Such choices are not made to limit 
creativity, but rather to cultivate ④ it. When everything is 
possible, creativity has no tension. Creativity is strange in 
that it finds its way in any kind of situation, no matter 
how restricted, just as the same amount of water flows 
faster and stronger through a narrow strait ⑤ than across 
the open sea.

The desert locust lives in two remarkably different 
styles depending on the availability of food sources and 
the density of the local locust population. When food is 
scarce, as it usually is in their native desert habitat, 
locusts are born with coloring designed for camouflage 
and lead (A) solitary / social  lives. But when rare periods 
of significant rain produce major vegetation growth, 
everything changes. At first, the locusts continue to be 
loners, just feasting off the (B) insufficient / abundant  
food supply. But as the extra vegetation starts to die 
off, the locusts find themselves crowded together. 
Suddenly, baby locusts are born with bright colors and a 
preference for company. Instead of avoiding one another 
and hiding from predators through camouflage and 
inactivity, these locusts gather in vast groups, feed 
together, and (C) overwhelm / overestimate their predators 
simply through numbers.

Ellie walked to school in her new shoes. “I like those,” 
Megan whispered. “Cool.” Ellie felt happy. ① She knew 
it was hard to get compliments from Megan and couldn’t 
hide her smile. The two friends had desks side by side at 
the back. “Stop talking, you two,” said Miss Smith. 
“Bring your books to me if you’ve finished.” Ellie 
followed Megan to the front of the class. ② She always 
let Megan go first. She felt scared when Miss Smith 
was upset. Miss Smith noticed ③ her new shoes. “Those 
aren’t suitable for school,” she said, her voice cold. Ellie 
took a deep breath. “The shop didn’t have black shoes,  
Miss Smith,” ④ she said. Her voice came out in a 
whisper. “The school uniform requires black or dark blue 
shoes,” said Miss Smith. “Report to me in proper shoes, 
please. On Monday.” ⑤ She used her quiet-shout voice 
and Ellie shivered.

31. In an increasingly globalized world, literature in 
translation has an especially important role. Increasingly, 
writers, readers, and publishers are turning to literature as 
a bridge between cultures, particularly Western and Arab 
societies. This growing interest is, in turn, driving a 
boom in translation. However, not surprisingly perhaps, 
most translations are from English into other languages, 
not from another language, such as Arabic, into English. 
Hence, the huge American market is seen as driving the  
. Bookstores in the United States, for example, 
rarely stock more than Nobel Prize winner Naguib 
Mahfouz’s Cairo Trilogy, a masterful, realistic account of 
life in Cairo and of a merchant family in the mid-20th 
century. Western readers likely know little of Mahfouz’s 
more experimental work, his political and religious 
allegories, or his historical dramas. The result is a kind 
of one-way mirror between America and the rest of the 
world. [3점]

32. We tend to assume that the way to get more time is 
to speed up. But speeding up can actually slow us down. 
Anyone who has ever rushed out of the house only to 
realize that their keys and wallet are sitting on the 
kitchen table knows this only too well. And it’s not just our 
efficiency that is reduced. The quality of the experience 
suffers too, as we become less aware or ‘mindful.’ Have 
you ever eaten an entire meal without tasting any of it? 
Hurrying up doesn’t just give us less time, it can also 
steal the pleasure and benefit from the time that we do 
have. For many of us, hurrying is a way of life. Some 
of us enjoy the thrill that it gives us while others are 
driven crazy by the constant pressure and feel that their 
lives are speeding up to an unacceptable degree. Either 
way, there are almost certainly areas of our life that 
could be .  [3점]
① affected by temporary sufferings
② disturbed by inconsistent behaviors
③ enhanced by a little go-slow behavior
④ complicated by slow-but-steady actions 
⑤ dominated by a little speedy decision making
33. The audience receives a sound signal entirely through 
the vibrations generated in the air, whereas in a singer 
some of the auditory stimulus is conducted to the ear 
through the singer’s own bones. Since these two ways of 
transferring sound have quite different relative efficiencies 
at various frequencies, the overall quality of the sound 
will be quite different. You have probably experienced this 
when you have listened to your own voice, as on tape or 
through a public address system. It is easy to blame the 
‘sound of a stranger’ on ‘poor electronics,’ but this is 
only partly justified. The major effect comes from the fact 
that you hear yourself differently from the way others hear 
you. This is one of the main reasons why even the most 
accomplished singers have to listen to the opinion of 
coaches and voice teachers as to ‘how they sound,’ whereas 
no concert violinist would have to do such a thing. To the 
violinist  
to someone else standing nearby. [3점]
* frequency: 주파수
① the coaches are more helpful than they are
② sounds spread a lot more widely than they do
③ the audience response is just as important as it is
④ playing sounds almost exactly the same as it does
⑤ the ‘sound of a stranger’ matters more than it does

Problems can be distinguished according to whether 
they are reasonable or unreasonable. Reasonable problems 
are of the kind that can be solved in a step-by-step 
manner. A crossword puzzle is of this nature. Given a 
sufficient vocabulary, the empty spaces can be filled in 
one by one. Unreasonable problems, (A) , cannot be 
treated this way because the task contains some ‘trick’ or 
‘catch’ that must be understood before someone can 
arrive at a solution. This feature frustrates any step-by-step 
process that proceeds without the realization that “things 
aren’t what they seem.” (B) , successful problem 
solving in these cases requires that the person acquire an 
insight into the nature of the trick. Riddles provide 
commonplace instances of such insight problems, such as 
the classic riddle that the Sphinx posed to Oedipus.

① in contrast …… Hence
② in contrast …… Nevertheless

School physical education programs should offer a 
balanced variety of activities that allow young people to 
develop ability in lifetime activities that are personally 
meaningful and enjoyable. A balance should exist in 
any physical education program among team, dual, 
and individual (lifetime) sports. ① Team sports such as 
basketball and soccer provide an opportunity for students 
to develop skills and to enjoy working and competing 
together as a team. ② However, in many school physical 
education programs, team sports dominate the curriculum 
at the expense of various individual and dual sports, like 
tennis, swimming, badminton, and golf. ③ In such cases, 
the students lose the opportunity to develop skills in 
activities that they can participate in throughout their 
adult lives. ④ Baseball, in particular, is one of the most 
popular sports frequently broadcast on TV. ⑤ Only through 
a balanced program of team, dual, and individual sports 
is it possible to develop well-rounded individuals.

Cultural characteristics are not only passed from 
parents to children, but may be passed on from any one 
individual to another by word of mouth or by writing.
(A) Like those infectious diseases, cultural habits such as 
pop music preferences and clothing fashions may 
spread very quickly nowadays, especially through the 
media of radio and television.
(B) So some cultural changes may be adopted quite 
quickly by a whole population. Transmission of 
culture is rather like transmission of an infection. Flu 
and colds spread very quickly, especially with the 
large amount of contact that people now have with 
each other.
(C) However, other deep-rooted cultural characteristics of 
races and racial subgroups are much more difficult to 
change. These are the cultural patterns that are so 
resistant to alteration that they have the appearance 
of being inherent.

The timing of positive versus negative behavior seems 
to influence attraction. Several studies have identified  
what has been called the loss-gain effect.
(A) Studies suggest that you would not. In fact, people 
are more attracted to individuals who are consistently 
negative than to people who initially behave positively 
and then switch to negative behavior.
(B) The reason is this: people who start out being nice 
get our hopes up, so the letdown we experience 
when we discover that they are not nice makes it 
worse than if they had acted badly from the start.
(C) This effect reflects what happens to attraction when a 
person’s behavior moves from positive to negative or 
from negative to positive. For example, if someone 
seemed very nice to you early in the interaction, but 
then began to act like a fool, would you be more 
attracted to that person than if that person were a 
fool from the start?

The spoonful of 95℃ soup hitting your foot hurts, but 
not as badly as it would if you accidentally spilled the 
entire pot of 95℃ soup on your foot.
Heat and temperature are two quantities that can be 
easily confused. Imagine cooking a very large pot of 
chicken soup on the stove. Let’s suppose you heat the 
soup until it is 95℃, quite hot. ( ① ) You grab a spoon 
and take out a spoonful of soup to taste. ( ② ) As you 
remove the spoonful of soup from the pot, it has the 
same temperature as the larger sample. ( ③ ) Unfortunately, 
as you bring the soup towards your mouth to taste it, the 
spoon slips from your hand, pouring its contents on your 
bare foot. ( ④ ) If both the spoonful and the pot full of 
soup have the same temperature, why would the larger 
sample cause more damage if it came in contact with 
your skin? ( ⑤ ) The answer to the question lies in the 
difference between temperature and heat.

They quickly pick out a whole series of items of the 
same type, making a handful of, say, small screws. 
People make extensive use of searching images. One 
unexpected context is sorting. Suppose you have a bag of 
small hardware ― screws, nails, and so on ― and you 
decide to organize them into little jars. You dump the 
stuff out on a table and begin separating the items into 
coherent groups. ( ① ) It is possible to do this by 
randomly picking up individual objects, one by one, 
identifying each one, and then moving it to the 
appropriate jar. ( ② ) But what most people do is very 
different. ( ③ ) They put them in the jar and then go 
back and do the same for a different kind of item. ( ④ ) 
So the sorting sequence is nonrandom, producing runs of 
items of a single type. ( ⑤ ) It is a faster, more

There are two types of managers in business 
organizations: functional managers and project managers. 
Both types of managers have different roles and 
qualities. Functional managers head one of a firm’s 
departments such as marketing or engineering, and they 
are specialists in the area they manage. They are skilled 
at breaking the components of a system into smaller 
elements, knowing something of the details of each 
operation for which they are responsible. On the other 
hand, project managers begin their career as specialists 
in some field. When promoted to the position of project 
manager, they must transform from technical caterpillar 
to generalist butterfly. They oversee many functional 
areas, each with its own specialists. Therefore, what is 
required is an ability to put many pieces of a task 
together to form a coherent whole. Thus, to understand 
a frog, for example, functional managers cut it open to 
examine it, but project managers watch it swim with 
other frogs and consider the environment.

It isn’t going to be easy making changes to the food 
your children eat, and even the most careful, patient 
parents will probably find that the little ones will resist 
at some point and to some degree. The problem is that 
many of us were forced to eat in a healthy way as 
children: we learned the hard way. And the temptation 
to continue with these parental habits with our own 
children is strong.
If you were made to sit at the table until you had 
cleaned your plate, you are not alone: most of the adult 
population have suffered this at some point ― at school 
if not at home. Forcing your children to eat, especially 
if they don’t like what is on the plate, is completely 
. “Sit there until you finish” may be 
how we learned, and may also be the only way you feel 
able to achieve your goal, but think about it: the 
experience of eating a pile of unwanted cabbage until 
they feel sick is hardly going to make children jump for 
joy the next time it is served. 
This strict approach is very old-fashioned, and you 
may win the battle but you definitely won’t win the 
war. Delaying puddings used to be thought of as a good 
idea too, but guess what? That doesn’t work either. “No 
pudding until you have finished your main course” was 
the standard line when most parents of today were 
young and is still commonly used, but it only makes 
sweet things seem more desirable.

(A) 
In 1887, when the land was up for sale, grandpa 
bought two hundred acres from the Granger family. In 
1918, (a) he bought another two hundred. It was good 
rich land. However, there were bank loans for and taxes on 
the land. Unfortunately, there had not been enough money 
from the cotton to pay both of them and live on. To 
make things worse, the price of cotton dropped in 1930.
(B)
Some of it belonged to Stacey, Christopher, and John, 
not to mention the part that belonged to big mama and 
mama. However, papa never divided the land in his mind; 
it was simply the land of our family. For it, (b) he would 
work the long, hot summer pounding steel; mama would 
teach and run the farm; and big mama, in her sixties, 
would work like a woman in her twenties in the cotton 
fields and keep the house; but always, the taxes would be 
paid. Papa said that one day I would understand.
(C)
When he came back from Louisiana, I asked papa 
why he had to go away and why the land was so 
important. (c) He took my hand and said in his quiet 
way: “Look out there, Cassie. All that belongs to you. 
You will never have to live on other people’s land. As 
long as the family survives, you will have your own 
place. That’s important. You may not understand now, 
but one day you will.” I looked at papa strangely, for I 
knew that all the land did not belong to me.
(D) 
That was why papa had gone to work, ending up in 
Louisiana in 1931. (d) He set out looking for work, first 
going far north and south, and finally west into Louisiana. 
It was there he found work laying track for the railroad. 
He worked the remainder of the year away from us, not 
returning until the deep winter. The following spring after 
the planting was finished, (e) he did the same. Now it 
was 1933, and papa was again in Louisiana laying track.
