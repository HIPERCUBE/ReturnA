The spoonful of 95℃ soup hitting your foot hurts, but 
not as badly as it would if you accidentally spilled the 
entire pot of 95℃ soup on your foot.
Heat and temperature are two quantities that can be 
easily confused. Imagine cooking a very large pot of 
chicken soup on the stove. Let’s suppose you heat the 
soup until it is 95℃, quite hot. ( ① ) You grab a spoon 
and take out a spoonful of soup to taste. ( ② ) As you 
remove the spoonful of soup from the pot, it has the 
same temperature as the larger sample. ( ③ ) Unfortunately, 
as you bring the soup towards your mouth to taste it, the 
spoon slips from your hand, pouring its contents on your 
bare foot. ( ④ ) If both the spoonful and the pot full of 
soup have the same temperature, why would the larger 
sample cause more damage if it came in contact with 
your skin? ( ⑤ ) The answer to the question lies in the 
difference between temperature and heat.
