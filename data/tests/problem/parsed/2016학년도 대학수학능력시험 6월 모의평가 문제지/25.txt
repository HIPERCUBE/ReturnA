25. 교황 Julius Ⅱ의 무덤에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 
않는 것은? 
The project of creating the tomb of Pope Julius Ⅱ was 
originally given to Michelangelo in 1505, but the tomb 
was not completed until 1545. It was designed by 
Michelangelo himself as the pope requested. The design 
called for some 40 statues, and the tomb was to be a 
giant structure. Just less than a year after the initial work 
on the tomb began, it stopped because of lack of funds. 
When Pope Julius Ⅱ died in 1513, he left money for the 
completion of his tomb, so Michelangelo started work 
again. After some years of carving, he completed Moses, 
one of the most famous statues of the tomb. However, 
the next pope, Leo X, had little interest in continuing the 
project. As time went on, its scale was reduced, and the 
project for the tomb was revised again and again.
