Tourism is important for more than just vacationing. 
Tourism allows people from different places and cultures 
to come together, and then tourists and host communities 
learn about each other’s differences and similarities. They 
also learn new tastes and ways of thinking, which may 
lead to a better understanding between hosts and tourists. 
Another positive effect of tourism is the aid it provides 
for the survival of a society’s culture, especially the 
culture’s art forms. The opportunity to sell native artworks 
to tourists or perform folk dances for them may encourage 
local artists to preserve traditional art forms. For example, 
Fijians have developed their palm mat and shell jewelry 
crafts into profitable tourist businesses. They also earn 
additional income by performing folk dances and fire 
walking.
