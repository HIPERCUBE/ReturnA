There are two types of managers in business 
organizations: functional managers and project managers. 
Both types of managers have different roles and 
qualities. Functional managers head one of a firm’s 
departments such as marketing or engineering, and they 
are specialists in the area they manage. They are skilled 
at breaking the components of a system into smaller 
elements, knowing something of the details of each 
operation for which they are responsible. On the other 
hand, project managers begin their career as specialists 
in some field. When promoted to the position of project 
manager, they must transform from technical caterpillar 
to generalist butterfly. They oversee many functional 
areas, each with its own specialists. Therefore, what is 
required is an ability to put many pieces of a task 
together to form a coherent whole. Thus, to understand 
a frog, for example, functional managers cut it open to 
examine it, but project managers watch it swim with 
other frogs and consider the environment.
