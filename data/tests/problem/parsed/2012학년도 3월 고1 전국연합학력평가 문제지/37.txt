My wife and I were running an ice­cream shop. Staying
open so late at night wasn’t such a big deal because we
made good money. After a while it didn’t work. Closing at
1:00 am and then coming back to open the store again at
11:00 am was physically painful. Those extra few dollars
earned at midnight just weren’t worth it when we looked at
what it did to us. So we closed our doors at 9:00 pm. By
forcing ourselves to close on time, our customers showed up
before our closing. We spent more time with our kids and
got good rest. We were also better prepared to go to work
the next day.
