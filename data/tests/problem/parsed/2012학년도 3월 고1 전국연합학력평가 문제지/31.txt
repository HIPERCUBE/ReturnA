31. Every day, I type passwords into programs and computers
many times. I keep checking emails over and over. And one

part of me, due to repetition. My password was “tennis,” and
although I did not always think about tennis on purpose, I
found that it was my favorite activity. It was what I put a
lot of time and effort in, and it was what I did most outside
of work. I later changed my passwords to a goal I’ve been
working on. They became .
① famous for being simple
② exposed to others in the end
③ annoying things to do everyday
④ easy for my friends to remember
⑤ regular reminders of my dreams
