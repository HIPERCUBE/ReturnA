What I learned from a man who runs a non­profit
organization is “Free advice, free upgrade, and free entry.
None are valued.” Free advice is seldom wanted. A free
upgrade is something you are going to get anyway. Free
entry? The band playing tonight must not be any good.
People link the value of a service with the amount of money
that is exchanged for it. Most people accept that lawyers
can charge them $400 an hour. They naturally guess that if
it costs an arm and a leg, then it must be worth it.
① More demands lead to higher prices.
② People do not respect things that are free.
③ Non­profit organizations need more donation.
④ Expensive concerts do not always satisfy you.
