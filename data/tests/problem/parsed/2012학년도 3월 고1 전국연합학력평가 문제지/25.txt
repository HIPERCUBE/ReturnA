25. 다음 글에 드러난 Jancsi의 심정으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Jancsi was up bright and early that morning. He didn’t
sleep well last night, as Cousin Kate was coming today. She
was the only cousin he had, and she was a city girl. A real
city girl from Budapest. Ever since the letter came from his
uncle, he was walking around with his head up on the big
Hungarian plain. He was the only boy in the neighborhood
who had a cousin in the city, and she was coming today to
stay for a long time. He decided to tell everybody about her
at school.
