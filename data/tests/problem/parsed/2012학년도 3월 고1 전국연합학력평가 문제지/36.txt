My brother, the mountain climber, once took me and a
friend up the 13,776­foot Grand Teton. It was terrifying!
As we ① climbed, the mountain went straight up. At that
point, we tied ourselves together with ropes to save our
lives if one of us ② fell. That rope kept me from taking
thousand­foot falls to my death two times. By ③ blocking
each other and trusting in the ropes, we finally reached the
top safely. You will do a lot more in life if you rope up and
④ borrow strength from others. The more ropes you have,
the ⑤ better your chances are for success.
