neighbor calls to my mother. As they talk, I wander to the
backyard of the neighbor’s.
(A) She makes the best barking sound I have ever heard a
human make. The dog cries and runs away. My mother
turns and says, “You have to show them who’s boss!”
(B) Suddenly, a German shepherd jumps at me. Awowwow! It
is tied with a chain. I am screaming. My mother runs to
me and asks, “What is it?” I say, “It’s a dog!” She asks,
“A dog? Around there?”

yells again. Awowwowow! I jump back. But my mother
pulls me forward and she barks back at the dog.
