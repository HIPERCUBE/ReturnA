Cesaria Evora was born in 1941, grew up in a poor family,
and was raised in an orphanage after her father died. She
began performing as a teenager at sailors’ restaurants and on
the ships at the harbor in Mindelo. She gave up music in
the 1970s because she was unable to make a living. But in
1985, she came back on the stage, and won the Grammy
Award in 2003. She was known as the “Barefoot Diva”
because she always performed without shoes. Cesaria Evora,
who brought the music of the tiny Cape Verde islands to a
worldwide audience, died in her native country at the age
of 70.
