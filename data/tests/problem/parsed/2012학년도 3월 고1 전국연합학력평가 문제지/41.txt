If you are looking to improve muscles, it can be very
tempting to really push your body beyond its limits. Many
people seem to agree that exercise should be painful. But
the truth of the matter is that this is a very dangerous idea.
Fatigue and pain are your body’s ways of saying that it is in
danger and is being overworked. While a good workout
should offer pressure and challenges, it should absolutely
never be painful. Likewise, you should never be pushing
your body every day.
