23. 다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?
There is a need out here that your station could fill. Ask
yourself, “What is more widely found in homes and offices
than even computers or TVs?” Answer: the potted plant. But
are these plants healthy and growing? Many times not. I
think a weekly evening program on basic indoor plant care
would be a big hit with your listeners. Rather than
overwhelm your audience with agricultural information, take
a light approach to the subject. Put some fun into describing
plants and plant care. The program could touch on
little­known topics like the effect of office music or
electromagnetic fields on plants. You could even have a
call­in segment for people to ask questions and share their
experiences. Doesn’t this sound like a winner? I think so.

In Philadelphia, planners have been experimenting with a new
way of slowing drivers down: painted 3­D triangles ① that
look like speed bumps. At one quarter of the cost of physical
bumps, the devices also have the advantage of not tearing
up emergency vehicle axles as they speed over ② them. A
month of investigation on a half­mile stretch of road found
that driver speeds ③ fell from an average of 38 miles per
hour to 23 miles per hour. While this drop is impressive,
the effect may be temporary as drivers, particularly those
who regularly travel that route, ④ to learn which bumps are
just illusions. Still, ⑤ slowing down the tourists might
provide enough benefit to be worth the cost.
* axle: 차축
25. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
There are several advantages to a partnership which is an
agreement between two or more people to finance and operate
a business. ①With more than one owner, the ability to raise
funds may be increased, both because two or more partners
may be able to contribute more funds and because their
borrowing capacity may be greater. ②As a partnership may
benefit from the combination of complementary skills of two
or more people, there is a wider pool of knowledge, skills and
contacts. ③ Partnerships can be cost­effective as each partner
specializes in certain aspects of their business. ④ In addition,
partnerships may have a limited life; they may end up with the
withdrawal or death of a partner. ⑤ Partnerships will provide
moral support and allow more creative brainstorming.
26. 다음 글에 나타난 “We”의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Far below, squeezed into a narrow valley, was Fontana Lake.
At the lake’s western end stands a big hydroelectric dam, the
biggest dam in America east of Mississippi. We hastened
down the trail to it as we expected that there would be a
visitors’ center there. This meant the possibility of a
cafeteria and other gratifying contacts with the developed
world. At the very least, we thought, there would be
vending machines and rest rooms, where we could wash and
get fresh water. There was indeed a visitors’ center, but it
was shut. The vending machine was empty and unplugged,
and even the rest rooms were locked. We found a tap on an
outside wall and turned it, but the water had been shut off.
① frightened → relieved ② bored → excited
③ hopeful → disappointed ④ annoyed → satisfied
⑤ embarrassed → thankful

A year after the Flip Video camcorders hit the market,
they had a 13 percent market share. They got that market
share with a product that did almost nothing compared to its
competitors. It only had a 2x zoom. It had only three
buttons― one to record and stop recording, one to play
video, and one to trash video. It wasn’t HD at the time. You
couldn’t take pictures with it. So, what made it so
successful? The Flip was simple. Your mastery was almost
immediate, and so was your sense of pride and happiness.
While it had a simple solution, that didn’t mean that
underlying technology was simple or that the underlying
business model was simple. It just meant that the experience
for the customer was simple. And people loved that.

28. According to field researchers, chimpanzees eat some
plants for . Chimps occasionally eat Aspilia,
which is not part of chimps’ usual diet because its leaves
are rough, sharp and extremely nasty to eat. They usually
eat it first thing in the morning and in a very different way
than normal food. They do not chew the leaves, but roll
them around in their mouth before swallowing. It looks just
as if they are taking old­fashioned medicine. Some African
people use Aspilia to relieve stomach complaints or remove
intestinal worms. It also has antibiotic properties. It is
thought that chimps use Aspilia for the same purposes.
① mood change ② nutritional balance
③ medicinal purposes ④ additional moisture
⑤ social interaction
29. When blood passes through cold muscles, oxygen in the
blood can’t detach itself from its hemoglobin very easily. It’s
as if the oxygen says, “It’s too cold in there. I’m staying
right here in the blood with my hemoglobin buddy.” As muscle
temperature rises, oxygen breaks away from the hemoglobin
more rapidly and more completely. If you plunge into an activity
without warming up, your “cold” muscles are, in effect, short of
oxygen for the first few minutes. You’ve probably experienced
this although you may not have understood it. There may
have been days when you hadn’t had time to warm up, and
the first ten minutes of jogging got you out of breath.
Essentially it’s because .
[3점]
① your muscles lacked oxygen
② your blood pressure was high
③ blood carried oxygen too rapidly
④ your blood had too much hemoglobin
⑤ oxygen was separated from the hemoglobin
30. Males and females compete for many of the same reasons
― to achieve leadership positions or feel good about their
abilities. In addition, both males and females tend to be more
motivated to win when they play on a team, compared to
when they play individually. There is a difference, though. In
one experiment, college students were asked to solve computer
maze puzzles. First, they solved the puzzles alone, without
any comparison of their results. Then the students were
asked to compete against each other in a tournament. The
men’s performance improved substantially when they were in
competition, but the women’s performance did not change from
when they were playing alone. The conclusion researchers made
was that, in general, .
① females are less interested in computer games than males
② playing on a team or alone doesn’t make any difference
③ females are not as motivated by competition as males
④ encouraging, not comparing, makes more desirable results
⑤ males are more cooperative than females in a tournament

The above graph shows the rate of parents who respond
they are doing a “very good” job as a parent or in balancing
work and family. ①Women are more likely than men to say
they are doing a very good job both as a parent and in
balancing work and family. ② Eight­in­ten mothers of younger
children rate themselves as a very good parent, while 63 %
of fathers with younger children do so. ③About two­thirds
of fathers with older children say they are doing a very
good job as a parent. ④More than three quaters of mothers
with older children say they are doing a very good job in
balancing work and family. ⑤ Fathers with older children are
less likely than those with younger children to give
themselves high marks in balancing work and family.
36. whistling thorn에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
A whistling thorn is an acacia tree which is commonly
seen on the savannas of East Africa. If you stand next to
the tree, you might hear it whistling. The noise comes from
the wind blowing through holes in swellings at the base of
the thorns, which act like tiny flutes. Thanks to its musical
ability, the acacia tree is called the whistling thorn. The
swollen thorns provide homes for particularly aggressive
types of ants, the acacia ants. In addition, the tree produces
sugary secretions that feed the ants. In return, the ants
protect the tree from animals. In fact, this particular acacia
doesn’t have the toxic chemicals that keep away insects and
animals like other species of acacias do. So, when a giraffe
tries to grab a mouthful of leaves with its tongue, the ants
swarm out of their thorns and attack with vicious stings.
* secretion: 분비액
① 동아프리카의 사바나 지역에 서식한다.
② 가시 아래 부분의 부푼 곳에 구멍이 있다.
③ 바람이 불 때 나는 소리로 인해 이름이 붙여졌다.
④ 개미에게 서식처와 먹이를 제공한다.
⑤ 자신을 보호하기 위한 독성 물질을 만들어 낸다.
37. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
An experiment was conducted using a diverse set of
behavioral measures to determine whether the use of dietary
supplements, such as vitamins, minerals or amino acids, would
influence subsequent health­related behaviors. Participants in
Group A were instructed to take a multivitamin and participants
in the control group were assigned to take a placebo.
However, all the participants actually took placebo pills. The
result from the experiment demonstrated that participants
who believed they had taken dietary supplements felt safe
from health problems, thus leading them to engage in
health­risk behaviors. To put it simply, people who take
dietary supplements may make poor decisions when it comes
to their health― such as choosing fast food over a healthy
and organic meal.
* placebo: 위약(僞藥)
① 패스트푸드를 자주 먹으면 영양 불균형을 피할 수 없다.
② 운동이 병행되지 않은 식이요법은 효과가 제한적이다.
③ 건강 보조 식품 사용이 소홀한 건강 관리로 이어질 수 있다.
④ 위생적인 생활 환경 관리는 면역 체계 강화에 필수적이다.
⑤ 효과적인 치료에 환자의 심리적 안정이 반드시 필요하다.

Caves, like the Pech Merle in southern France, are adorned
with paintings of white horses with black spots. Past studies
of ancient DNA had only turned up evidence of brown and
black horses during that time. That led scientists to question
whether the spotted horses were real or fantasy. An
international team analyzed DNA from fossilized bones and
teeth from 31 prehistoric horses. The samples were recovered
from more than a dozen archaeological sites in Siberia,
Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. It turned out six of the
horses had a genetic mutation that gave rise to a spotted
coat, suggesting that ancient artists were drawing what they
were seeing. Anthropologist John Shea said that cave artists
were in tune with their surroundings since they needed to
know all they could about their prey to hunt them.

① Cave: Birthplace of Ancient Art
② Cave Painters Were Realists
③ Imagination of Cave Artists
④ Horse: An Ancient Symbol of Wealth

But there is more and more evidence that some animals
use symbolic tools in much the same way.
Symbolic tool use is something people do every time they
pay for an item with paper bills or coins.　 Some monkeys
and apes in captivity have learned to use tokens that they
trade for various foods. (① )　But Robert W. Shumaker, the
author of Orangutans, is more interested in the sort of
symbolic tools that can affect emotions. (② )　Children often
have a special stuffed animal or blanket that is much more
than a toy;　 the object represents comfort or security to
them, and they use it to feel better.　(③ ) This behavior of
children is what scientists once considered uniquely human.
(④ )　 Shumaker would see great apes in times of great
stress or sadness, like a female who had an infant that died.
(⑤ ) “That female would create something that researchers
called a doll and then treat it exactly as she had treated her
infant that had recently died,” he says.

There was a series of experiments about factors which
affect the way of people’s behaviors. In the first of the
experiments, commuters gave more money to a charity
collector at the top of an escalator than to one at the
bottom. In another experiment 60 volunteers were asked
to give out an amount of hot chilli sauce to be eaten by
a stranger who they were told disliked hot food. Those
who had been taken up to a stage dished out less than
half the amount than those who had been taken down to
an orchestra pit. And in a third, people were less likely
to inflict punishment on another person after they
ascended steps― and were crueler after they went down
stairs. The link between where we are and how we
behave may sound unlikely, but psychologists say there
are plenty of clues linking the two in real life.
According to the experiments above, people’s (A) is
likely to be influenced by the (B) of the place where
they are located.

② generosity height

[41-42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Daniel, a freshman in college, enrolled in a public
speaking course. There was one senior in the class
named Rick, who spoke with authority. Daniel would sit
fascinated by the sound of his voice. Rick would stand
behind the podium, almost motionless, with only the
slightest twist of the wrist or a subtle tilting of his head
to emphasize a point. What confidence! Daniel now had a
role model for speaking.
As he practiced his speech, Daniel literally spent hours
trying to Rick’s deep, resonant musical notes.
As he practiced, his body wanted to dance. But Daniel
restricted his movement, so he could Rick’s
subtle gestures and posturing. His practice was paying
off. He was speaking and moving just like Rick.
One morning in class, Daniel got up to speak. His
voice was deep like Rick’s. His gestures were as subtle
as any Rick had presented. In fact, Daniel felt like he
was Rick! But something wasn’t right. It wasn’t until
after class that Lucy, one of the other students, came up
to Daniel and said, “I liked the ‘friendly’ Daniel more.”
That’s all she had to say. She liked the old Daniel, and
not his imitation of Rick. Daniel took Lucy’s comment to
heart, and two weeks later he delivered his next speech
in a more relaxed and conversational tone of voice. He
talked and moved naturally. He wasn’t acting like
somebody else. And it felt right.

(A)
One day Howard Kelly, a poor boy, who was selling
goods from door to door to pay his way through school,
found he had only one thin dime left, and he was
hungry. He decided he would ask for a meal at the next
house. However, he lost his nerve when Grace, a lovely
young woman, opened the door. Instead of a meal he
asked for a drink of water.
(B)
Years later Grace became critically ill. Her doctor was
baffled. (a) He finally sent her to the big city, where
they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr.
Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When
he heard the name of the town she came from, a
strange light filled his eyes. Immediately (b) he rose and
went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed
in his doctor’s gown he went in to see her. He
recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation
room determined to do his best to save her life. From
that day on he gave special attention to the case.
* baffle: 당황하게 하다
(C)
She thought (c) he looked hungry, so she brought him
a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly, and then
asked, “How much do I owe you?” “You don’t owe me
anything. Mother has taught us never to accept pay for
an act of kindness,” she replied. “Then I thank you from
the bottom of my heart,” he said. As Howard Kelly left
that house, (d) he not only felt stronger physically, but
his faith in man was stronger.
(D)
After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly
requested the business office to pass Grace’s final bill to
him for approval. (e) He looked at it, then wrote
something on the edge and the bill was sent to her
room. She feared to open it, for she was sure it would
take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally she
looked, and something caught her attention on the side
of the bill. She began to read the following words: “Paid
in full with one glass of milk. Dr. Howard Kelly.”
