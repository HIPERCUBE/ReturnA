Caves, like the Pech Merle in southern France, are adorned
with paintings of white horses with black spots. Past studies
of ancient DNA had only turned up evidence of brown and
black horses during that time. That led scientists to question
whether the spotted horses were real or fantasy. An
international team analyzed DNA from fossilized bones and
teeth from 31 prehistoric horses. The samples were recovered
from more than a dozen archaeological sites in Siberia,
Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. It turned out six of the
horses had a genetic mutation that gave rise to a spotted
coat, suggesting that ancient artists were drawing what they
were seeing. Anthropologist John Shea said that cave artists
were in tune with their surroundings since they needed to
know all they could about their prey to hunt them.
