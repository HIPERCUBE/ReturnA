Every Sunday evening Jane’s mother opened the little square 
piano and picked out hymns. Those evenings on which ① she 
opened it were the happiest hours of Jane’s childhood. Whenever　
② she started toward the instrument, Jane used to follow her 
with great interest and irrepressible joy. Jane’s mother used to 
allow her to sit by her side and sometimes ③ she would even let 
Jane interrupt her by chiming in with strange harmonies. Always 
on such evenings, when the music was over,　④ she would hold 
Jane close. Many and many a night　⑤ she thus fell asleep in her 
mother’s arms. The memory of that picture has more than once 
kept her from straying too far from the place of purity and safety 
in which her mother’s arms held her.
