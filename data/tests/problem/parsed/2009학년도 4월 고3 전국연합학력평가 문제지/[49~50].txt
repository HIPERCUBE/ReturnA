The old suit of clothes will answer for another season; a 
cold bath and a brisk walk will prove more exciting than 
(a) a ride in the finest coach; a social chat and an evening’s 
reading in the family circle will be far more pleasant than 
(b) a five hundred dollar party when the reflection on the 
difference in cost is indulged in by those who begin to 
know (c) the pleasures of saving. Thousands of men are 
kept poor, and tens of thousands are made so after they have 
acquired quite sufficient money to support them well through 
life, in consequence of (d) spending their pay on unnecessary

luxuries, until in a short time their expenses swallow up their 
income, and they become ruined in their ridiculous attempts to 
keep up appearances, and make a sensation.
