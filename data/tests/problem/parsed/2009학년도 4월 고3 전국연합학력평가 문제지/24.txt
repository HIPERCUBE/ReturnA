24.  Most people know what a check is: an authorization to pay a 
designated amount of money out of an established account. But 
what does a check look like? The obvious answer is that it is a 
piece of paper and specially imprinted with the name and 
number of the bank. Although most checks would meet this 
description, not all checks have been so                  . Unless 
specific laws or regulations specify otherwise, any legitimate 
written authorization to pay money out of an account is an 
acceptable check. Thus, checks have been written on 
newspapers, handkerchiefs, and countless other unusual 
materials. A Canadian bank cashed a check written on the shell 
of a hard-boiled egg. A check of Manhattan Bank made of solid 
steel was so heavy that it had to be carried by two men.
