27.  The standard written language that we know today was 
established during the early part of the Modern English period. 
The standardization of the language was due in the first place to 
the need of the central government for regular procedures by 
which to conduct its business, to keep its records, and to 
communicate with the citizens of the land. John H. Fisher argues 
that standard English was first the language of the Court of 
Chancery, founded in the fifteenth century to give prompt 
justice to English citizens and to consolidate the King’s influence 
in the nation. Standard languages are                                      , 
developed to meet a specific administrative need rather than 
spontaneous developments of the folk or the artifice of writers 
and scholars. [3점]
