Why do my ears pop when I go up in a plane? In the middle 
part of each ear, there is a sac of air behind the eardrum. The 
air there usually has the same air pressure as the air outside. 
When you take off in an airplane, the air pressure outside the 
ear goes down, but the pressure inside the ear stays the same 
as it was on the ground. The inside air starts to push against 
the eardrum, causing pain. From the sac of air in each ear leads 
a tube called the Eustachian tube, which connects to the nasal 
passages and outside into the environment. When we swallow 
or yawn, the tubes open up allowing the pressure in the ear to 
become more like the pressure outside the ear. This causes the 
popping sound. The same thing happens when your plane goes 
to land.

[46~48] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A) Mr. Beezley has been an elementary school teacher for 
many years, but teaching school in a small agricultural town in 
northwestern New Mexico is a new experience for him. 
Although he’s been in town since early July, he hasn’t attended 
any of the social events in the local community. By September, 
he’s acquired a reputation as a cold and arrogant Easterner.
(B) On one occasion early in the school year, Mr. Beezley was 
quite surprised to see a boy get out of his seat to help a 
classmate with an assignment. A few minutes later, two other 
boys left their seats to work with classmates. When he 
approached them, they continued to talk as if he weren’t even 
there. He was shocked by their bold behavior. Back in 
Massachusetts, where he taught students, his presence alone 
was enough to silence any misbehaving students.
(C) And that evening, he went to the home of one of his 
students and had dinner with several of his students’ families. 
After dinner, when a neighbor’s truck broke down, the entire 
group went to the man’s aid. Two parents drove to town for 
needed parts. Several people held lights, and others offered 
occasional suggestions and strategies. Through the experiences, 
he discovered how different families often live very 
intermingled lives. Mr. Beezley finally feels comfortable enough 
with the others. He now realizes one of the aspects of Navajo 
culture that he was completely unaware of. 
(D) So he angrily snatched the assignments on which the two 
students had been collaborating and insisted they return to their 
seats. A few children were very upset by their teacher’s
reaction. A few days later, his students with their parents 
visited him after school. “Come...,” said one of the parents. 
“...and join us for dinner...,” added another. “...for it will give us 
a chance...,” continued a third. “...to get to know one another,”
finished a fourth. They talked as a collective group!
