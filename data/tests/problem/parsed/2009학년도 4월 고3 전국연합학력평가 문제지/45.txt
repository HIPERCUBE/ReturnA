Why do my ears pop when I go up in a plane? In the middle 
part of each ear, there is a sac of air behind the eardrum. The 
air there usually has the same air pressure as the air outside. 
When you take off in an airplane, the air pressure outside the 
ear goes down, but the pressure inside the ear stays the same 
as it was on the ground. The inside air starts to push against 
the eardrum, causing pain. From the sac of air in each ear leads 
a tube called the Eustachian tube, which connects to the nasal 
passages and outside into the environment. When we swallow 
or yawn, the tubes open up allowing the pressure in the ear to 
become more like the pressure outside the ear. This causes the 
popping sound. The same thing happens when your plane goes 
to land.
