It is a small sum of money periodically given to children by 
their parents, typically on a weekly or monthly basis. Their 
parents allow them a fixed amount of money within a given 
period of time. It is a way for children to learn about handling 
money and about saving or spending. Most children can begin to 
understand these ideas at age six or seven, and so that is a good 
time to start giving it. Often parents demand that certain 
household duties such as cleaning or sharing be done as a 
condition of receiving it, in an attempt to teach their children 
about responsibility. Earning it can teach children to understand 
how the economic system works.
