A wave is a rhythmic movement that carries energy through 
matter or space. In the ocean, waves move through seawater. 
Several terms are used to describe waves, as shown in the 
figure above. The crest is the ① highest point of each wave. 
The ② trough is the lowest point of each wave. Wavelength is 
the ③ horizontal distance between the crests or between the 
troughs of two adjacent waves. Wave height is the vertical 
distance between ④ crest and trough. Half the distance of the 
⑤ wavelength is called the amplitude of the wave. The 
amplitude squared is proportional to the amount of energy the 
wave carries. 
*squared: 제곱한
