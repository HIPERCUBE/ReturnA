25.  Umbrellas and automobiles are different. Not just because of 
size, function, and cost, but for a reason we seldom stop to 
consider. A person can use an umbrella without buying another 
product. An automobile, by contrast, cannot be used without 
fuel, repair services, and spare parts. The umbrella, therefore, is 
an individual, so to speak, delivering value to its user 
irrespective of any other products. The auto, by contrast, is        
. It completely depends on other products. So do  
tape recorders, refrigerators, and thousands of other products 
that work only when combined with others. The television set 
would stare blankly into the living room if someone somewhere 
were not transmitting images to it.
