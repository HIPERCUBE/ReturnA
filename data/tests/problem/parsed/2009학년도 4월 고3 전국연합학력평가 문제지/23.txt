The dream of employing beams of energy is actually not new. 
The concept of using rays as a practical weapon is shown 
through history and in old films. ① In 214 B.C., Archimedes is 
believed to have created large batteries of solar reflectors that 
focused the sun’s rays onto the sails of enemy ships. ② Ray guns 
burst onto the science fiction scene in 1889 with H. G. Wells’s 
classic War of the Worlds, in which aliens from Mars devastate 
entire cities by shooting beams of heat energy. ③ In medical 
science, doctors typically take advantage of ultrasonic waves in 
surgical operations. ④ During World War II, the Nazis 
experimented with various forms of ray guns. ⑤ Weapons 
created from focused light beams entered the public imagination 
with the James Bond movie Goldfinger, the first Hollywood film 
to feature a laser.
