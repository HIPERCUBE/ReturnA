I’m an eleventh-grade student at Kalaua High School. Our 
school is working to keep the environment clean. To help our 
community take care of its trash problem, my science class has 
decided to pick up all the trash along Booth Street on Saturday, 
April 25. Would your grocery store please help us by donating 
60 garbage bags? I have attached my teacher’s description of the 
project, along with his signature. I will contact you on Saturday, 
April 18, about this project. If your answer is yes, then I will 
pick up the bags on April 24. In return for your donation, we will 
mention your store in our news release.
