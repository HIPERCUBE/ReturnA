It is a small sum of money periodically given to children by 
their parents, typically on a weekly or monthly basis. Their 
parents allow them a fixed amount of money within a given 
period of time. It is a way for children to learn about handling 
money and about saving or spending. Most children can begin to 
understand these ideas at age six or seven, and so that is a good 
time to start giving it. Often parents demand that certain 
household duties such as cleaning or sharing be done as a 
condition of receiving it, in an attempt to teach their children 
about responsibility. Earning it can teach children to understand 
how the economic system works.
① 용돈 ② 주식 ③ 예금
④ 벌금 ⑤ 월급
19. 밑줄 친 she가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Every Sunday evening Jane’s mother opened the little square 
piano and picked out hymns. Those evenings on which ① she 
opened it were the happiest hours of Jane’s childhood. Whenever　
② she started toward the instrument, Jane used to follow her 
with great interest and irrepressible joy. Jane’s mother used to 
allow her to sit by her side and sometimes ③ she would even let 
Jane interrupt her by chiming in with strange harmonies. Always 
on such evenings, when the music was over,　④ she would hold 
Jane close. Many and many a night　⑤ she thus fell asleep in her 
mother’s arms. The memory of that picture has more than once 
kept her from straying too far from the place of purity and safety 
in which her mother’s arms held her.

When we enter a room, we immediately recognize the floor, 
chairs, furniture, tables, and so forth. But when a robot scans 
a room, it sees nothing but a vast collection of straight and 
curved lines, (A) which / what it converts to pixels. It takes 
an enormous amount of computing time to make sense out of 
this jumble of lines. A computer sees only a collection of 
circles, ovals, spirals, straight lines, curly lines, corners, and 
so on. (B) Spending / Spent an enormous amount of computing 
time, a robot might finally recognize the object as a table. But 
if you rotate the image, the computer has to start all over 
again. In other words, robots can see, and in fact they can see 
(C) much / very better than humans, but they don’t understand 
what they are seeing.

Although life is different from nonlife, it is not ① completely 
different. Living things exist in a nonliving universe and depend 
on ② it in many ways. Plants absorb energy from sunlight, and 
bats find shelter in caves. Indeed, living things are made of the 
same tiny particles ③ that make up nonliving things. What makes 
organisms different from the materials that compose them ④ are 
their level of organization. Living things exhibit not just one but 
many layers of biological organization. This tendency toward 
order is sometimes ⑤ modeled in a pyramid of life.
23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
The dream of employing beams of energy is actually not new. 
The concept of using rays as a practical weapon is shown 
through history and in old films. ① In 214 B.C., Archimedes is 
believed to have created large batteries of solar reflectors that 
focused the sun’s rays onto the sails of enemy ships. ② Ray guns 
burst onto the science fiction scene in 1889 with H. G. Wells’s 
classic War of the Worlds, in which aliens from Mars devastate 
entire cities by shooting beams of heat energy. ③ In medical 
science, doctors typically take advantage of ultrasonic waves in 
surgical operations. ④ During World War II, the Nazis 
experimented with various forms of ray guns. ⑤ Weapons 
created from focused light beams entered the public imagination 
with the James Bond movie Goldfinger, the first Hollywood film 
to feature a laser.

24.  Most people know what a check is: an authorization to pay a 
designated amount of money out of an established account. But 
what does a check look like? The obvious answer is that it is a 
piece of paper and specially imprinted with the name and 
number of the bank. Although most checks would meet this 
description, not all checks have been so                  . Unless 
specific laws or regulations specify otherwise, any legitimate 
written authorization to pay money out of an account is an 
acceptable check. Thus, checks have been written on 
newspapers, handkerchiefs, and countless other unusual 
materials. A Canadian bank cashed a check written on the shell 
of a hard-boiled egg. A check of Manhattan Bank made of solid 
steel was so heavy that it had to be carried by two men.
① touchable ② diverse
③ counterfeit ④ inconvenient
⑤ conventional
25.  Umbrellas and automobiles are different. Not just because of 
size, function, and cost, but for a reason we seldom stop to 
consider. A person can use an umbrella without buying another 
product. An automobile, by contrast, cannot be used without 
fuel, repair services, and spare parts. The umbrella, therefore, is 
an individual, so to speak, delivering value to its user 
irrespective of any other products. The auto, by contrast, is        
. It completely depends on other products. So do  
tape recorders, refrigerators, and thousands of other products 
that work only when combined with others. The television set 
would stare blankly into the living room if someone somewhere 
were not transmitting images to it. 
① a team player ② a status symbol
③ a necessary evil ④ a modern convenience
⑤ a must-have device
26.  We’re constantly making decisions, ranging from what to eat 
for dinner each night to whom we should marry, not to mention 
all those flavors of ice cream. We base many of our decisions on 
whether we think a particular preference will increase our 
well-being. Intuitively, we seem convinced that the more 
choices we have, the better off we’ll ultimately be. But our 
world of unlimited opportunity                                               . 
In what one psychologist calls “the paradox of choice,” facing 
many possibilities leaves us stressed out, and less satisfied with 
whatever we do decide. Having too many choices keeps us 
wondering about all the opportunities missed.
① imprisons us more than it makes us happy
② introduces various leisure activities to us
③ offers a wide choice of business partners
④ encourages us to lead a happy life
⑤ helps us achieve our goals in life
27.  The standard written language that we know today was 
established during the early part of the Modern English period. 
The standardization of the language was due in the first place to 
the need of the central government for regular procedures by 
which to conduct its business, to keep its records, and to 
communicate with the citizens of the land. John H. Fisher argues 
that standard English was first the language of the Court of 
Chancery, founded in the fifteenth century to give prompt 
justice to English citizens and to consolidate the King’s influence 
in the nation. Standard languages are                                      , 
developed to meet a specific administrative need rather than 
spontaneous developments of the folk or the artifice of writers 
and scholars. [3점]
*the Court of Chancery: (영국의) 대법관 법정
① the reflection of modern technology
② the voice of the common people
③ the results of foreign influences
④ the byproducts of bureaucracy
⑤ the basis of ancient literature
28. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적절한 
것은? 
The great awakening of Greek art to freedom took place 
between, roughly, 520 and 420 B.C. Toward the end of the fifth 
century, artists became fully (A) conscious / deprived of their 
power and mastery, and so did the public. An increasing number 
of people began to be interested in their work for its own sake, 
and not only for the sake of its religious or political functions. 
People compared the (B) merits / perils of the various ‘schools’ 
of art; that is to say, of the various methods, styles and traditions 
which distinguished the masters in different cities. There is no 
doubt that the comparison and competition between these schools 
(C) stimulated / simulated the artist to make ever greater 
efforts, and helped to create that variety which we admire in 
Greek art.
   (A)   (B)     (C)
① conscious …… merits …… stimulated
② conscious …… perils …… stimulated
③ deprived …… merits …… simulated
④ deprived …… perils …… simulated

29. 파도에 대한 글의 내용 중, 밑줄 친 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 
것은? [3점] 
A wave is a rhythmic movement that carries energy through 
matter or space. In the ocean, waves move through seawater. 
Several terms are used to describe waves, as shown in the 
figure above. The crest is the ① highest point of each wave. 
The ② trough is the lowest point of each wave. Wavelength is 
the ③ horizontal distance between the crests or between the 
troughs of two adjacent waves. Wave height is the vertical 
distance between ④ crest and trough. Half the distance of the 
⑤ wavelength is called the amplitude of the wave. The 
amplitude squared is proportional to the amount of energy the 
wave carries. 
*squared: 제곱한
30. 다음 글에 드러난 필자의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
We drove there after dinner, filled ourselves with tea, and then 
set out, all four of us, to take a walk through the grove. 
Bizmionkov took old lady Ozhogina’s arm; I, Liza’s. The day was 
already giving way to evening. I was then at the very height of 
first love, in that state of passionate and intense admiration. 
Until that day I had never had a chance to take Liza by the arm. 
We went along together, side by side, quietly walking across the 
green grass. A light breeze seemed to be fluttering around us, 
among the white trunks of the birches, from time to time tossing 
the ribbon of her hat into my face. I persistently followed her 
with my eyes until, finally, she turned cheerfully to me, and we 
both smiled at each other. My head was spinning from an excess 
of pleasure. The birds sang approvingly above us, the blue sky 
pierced gently through the fine leaves. 
*flutter: 펄럭이다
① happy and joyful ② nervous and worried
③ cold and indifferent ④ lost and disappointed
⑤ sorry and apologetic
36. American pika에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The American pika is a small hamster-like animal with short 
limbs and round ears. They spend most of the daytime searching 
for food and guarding their territory. They are vocal animals, so 
they can use both calls and songs to communicate with one 
another. The American pika is very sensitive to high 
temperatures and can die within an hour if the outside 
temperature exceeds 75℉. So, the American pika’s thick fur can 
be its downfall. As their habitat’s temperature rises, they move 
higher up the mountainsides. For this reason, they are 
considered to be one of the best early warning systems for 
detecting global warming in the western United States.

37. CIV에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The CIV, an ultra-light scout vehicle, is built to run ahead and 
find a safe route before the heavy machinery rolls through in an 
Antarctic expedition. Made of 80 percent aircraft-grade 
aluminum, the CIV weighs only 793 pounds. The CIV is light 
enough that its crew can drag it across the snow if the ground 
gets too rough. The vehicle glides on three Teflon-coated skis, 
each mounted independently to shock absorbers that can flex 
more than two feet in case of a particularly brutal bump. Once 
out in front of the group, the CIV uses ice-penetrating radar to 
detect crevasses and other hazards in order to map out a route 
for two six-wheel trucks carrying the rest of the crew and 
equipment.

38.  If you bang your knee on the car door getting out of the car, 
you really feel it. Your knee is sore. You don’t deny it or repress 
it. You feel it. However, you also know that there are more 
important things to think about in your office than your sore 
knee. In fact, you can probably still go inside and do what you 
were going to do despite the sore knee. And if you really get 
enthused about what you’re doing, the awareness of the sore 
knee disappears, and you hardly think about it again. This is a 
very healthy way to deal with physical pain. Although you pay 
attention to it, you always know that there’s more to you than 
the pain. You, in effect, forget it. It’s your lifelong habit. And 
the habit serves you.

⑤ 경미한 교통사고도 신체에 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있다.
39.  Overgrazing of the savanna is one of the biggest factors in the 
shrinking of the lake, according to the scientists, Coe and Foley. 
“As the climate became drier, the vegetation that supported 
grazing livestock began to disappear. Vegetation has a big 
influence, especially in semiarid regions, in determining weather 
patterns,” said Foley. “The loss of vegetation in itself 
contributed to a drier climate.” The situation is a “domino 
effect,” the researchers say. Overgrazing reduces vegetation, 
which in turn reduces the ecosystem’s ability to recycle 
moisture back into the atmosphere. That contributes to the 
retreat of the monsoons. The consequent drought conditions 
have triggered a huge increase in the use of lake water for 
irrigation, while the Sahara has gradually edged southward.

Our experiences may consist partly of certain emotions we 
feel and partly of certain thoughts we think, but most of them 
will be a cluster of sense impressions.
(A) Similarly, to present a winter day, Shakespeare gives 
hanging “icicles,” milk “frozen,” and Marian’s “red and raw” 
nose as well as the melancholy “Tu-whit, tu-who” of the 
owl in his poem, Winter.
(B) The sense impressions of a spring day, for instance, will 
consist of seeing blue sky and white clouds, budding leaves 
and daffodils. Poets seeking to express the experience of a 
spring day, therefore, provide a selection of sense 
impressions. 
(C) Had he not done so, he might have failed to evoke the 
emotions of a winter day that accompany these sensations. 
The poet’s language, then, is more sensuous than ordinary 
language. It is richer in imagery.

41.  In the past twenty years, the number of practicing doctors in 
America has nearly doubled. So you would think, with all those 
new doctors running around, that Americans would be consulting 
their medical professionals at every opportunity. They’re not. In 
fact, the biggest trend in American health care is DIYDs ―
Do-It-Yourself Doctors. These are people who research their 
own symptoms, diagnose their own illnesses, and administer 
their own cures. If they have to call on doctors at all, they either 
treat them like ATM machines for prescriptions they already 
“knew” they need, or they show up in their offices with 
full-color descriptions of their conditions, self-diagnosed on 
the medical websites.
① Go and See a Doctor at Once!
② DIYDs Trend: Self Health Care
③ Do Not Ignore Physical Changes!
④ Regular Check Up: Life Preserver

42.  Rangers in Kenya have outfitted elephants with 
cellphone-and GPS-equipped collars that send warning 
messages when the pachyderms are about to raid farms. In 2006 
the rangers tested the collars on a repeat offender named 
Kimani, who had broken through electric fences 20 nights in a 
row and caused thousands of dollars in damage to crops and 
farm equipment. Most farmers had no idea that their field was 
being raided until the damage was done. Now Kimani’s collar 
texts his hourly position to a server in Nairobi, where software 
compares the animal’s location with a database of virtual borders 
established around villages and farms. If Kimani strays across 
one of those borders, the system alerts researchers and rangers 
in the area so they can coax him away from trouble.

43. 다음 글의 분위기로 가장 적절한 것은? 
The sea was cast into tremendous confusion. There was a 
fearful, sullen sound of rushing waves and broken surges. Deep 
called unto deep. At times the black column of clouds overhead 
seemed torn apart by flashes of lightning, which shook along the 
foaming surges and made the succeeding darkness doubly 
terrible. The thunders yelled over the wild waste of waters, and 
were echoed and prolonged by the mountain-sized waves. The 
ship was rising and falling among these roaring waves. Her yards 
would dip into the water: her bow was almost buried beneath the 
waves. Sometimes an impending surge appeared ready to 
overwhelm her.

At first, it would perhaps crawl a few inches there, but soon 
be exhausted by　the enormous gravitational pull of the planet.
It is believed that the life-forms on this planet first evolved in 
the sea. ( ① ) When there were no animals yet to be found on 
land, the sea was already filled with life. ( ② ) Then at some 
point, one of the sea creatures must have started to venture onto 
dry land. ( ③ ) So it would return to the water, where gravity is 
almost nonexistent and where it could live with much greater 
ease. ( ④ ) And then it tried again and again, and much later 
would adapt to life on land, grow feet instead of fins, and develop 
lungs instead of gills. ( ⑤ ) What made fish leave their habitat 
and evolve may have been a large sea area that got cut off from 
the main ocean where the water gradually receded over 
thousands of years.

Why do my ears pop when I go up in a plane? In the middle 
part of each ear, there is a sac of air behind the eardrum. The 
air there usually has the same air pressure as the air outside. 
When you take off in an airplane, the air pressure outside the 
ear goes down, but the pressure inside the ear stays the same 
as it was on the ground. The inside air starts to push against 
the eardrum, causing pain. From the sac of air in each ear leads 
a tube called the Eustachian tube, which connects to the nasal 
passages and outside into the environment. When we swallow 
or yawn, the tubes open up allowing the pressure in the ear to 
become more like the pressure outside the ear. This causes the 
popping sound. The same thing happens when your plane goes 
to land.

(A) Mr. Beezley has been an elementary school teacher for 
many years, but teaching school in a small agricultural town in 
northwestern New Mexico is a new experience for him. 
Although he’s been in town since early July, he hasn’t attended 
any of the social events in the local community. By September, 
he’s acquired a reputation as a cold and arrogant Easterner.
(B) On one occasion early in the school year, Mr. Beezley was 
quite surprised to see a boy get out of his seat to help a 
classmate with an assignment. A few minutes later, two other 
boys left their seats to work with classmates. When he 
approached them, they continued to talk as if he weren’t even 
there. He was shocked by their bold behavior. Back in 
Massachusetts, where he taught students, his presence alone 
was enough to silence any misbehaving students.
(C) And that evening, he went to the home of one of his 
students and had dinner with several of his students’ families. 
After dinner, when a neighbor’s truck broke down, the entire 
group went to the man’s aid. Two parents drove to town for 
needed parts. Several people held lights, and others offered 
occasional suggestions and strategies. Through the experiences, 
he discovered how different families often live very 
intermingled lives. Mr. Beezley finally feels comfortable enough 
with the others. He now realizes one of the aspects of Navajo 
culture that he was completely unaware of. 
(D) So he angrily snatched the assignments on which the two 
students had been collaborating and insisted they return to their 
seats. A few children were very upset by their teacher’s
reaction. A few days later, his students with their parents 
visited him after school. “Come...,” said one of the parents. 
“...and join us for dinner...,” added another. “...for it will give us 
a chance...,” continued a third. “...to get to know one another,”
finished a fourth. They talked as a collective group!

[49~50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
The old suit of clothes will answer for another season; a 
cold bath and a brisk walk will prove more exciting than 
(a) a ride in the finest coach; a social chat and an evening’s 
reading in the family circle will be far more pleasant than 
(b) a five hundred dollar party when the reflection on the 
difference in cost is indulged in by those who begin to 
know (c) the pleasures of saving. Thousands of men are 
kept poor, and tens of thousands are made so after they have 
acquired quite sufficient money to support them well through 
life, in consequence of (d) spending their pay on unnecessary 
things. Prosperity is a more severe hardship than adversity, 
especially sudden prosperity. “                                     ,” is 
an old and true proverb. A spirit of pride and vanity is the 
undying worm which bites the very vitals of a man’s 
possessions. Many persons, as they begin to prosper, 
immediately expand their ideas and start (e) expending for 
luxuries, until in a short time their expenses swallow up their 
income, and they become ruined in their ridiculous attempts to 
keep up appearances, and make a sensation.
