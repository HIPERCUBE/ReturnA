33.  When people read critical essays, they usually look for “proof.” 
Like scientists who require proof of the sort that they can 
duplicate in their own laboratories, readers of criticism want 
access to every process of inference, analysis, and deduction that 
has led to your conclusions. However, if that requirement were 
placed on literary analysis, a critical essay would be interminable, 
since more can always be said about any interpretive point. 
Therefore, providing persuasive proof of a major point is more 
effective than attempting to prove every point in the critical 
essays. Writers’ sound and concrete handling of major points 
makes readers trust their judgment on lesser matters.
