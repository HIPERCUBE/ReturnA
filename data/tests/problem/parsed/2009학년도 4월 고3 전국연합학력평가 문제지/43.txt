The sea was cast into tremendous confusion. There was a 
fearful, sullen sound of rushing waves and broken surges. Deep 
called unto deep. At times the black column of clouds overhead 
seemed torn apart by flashes of lightning, which shook along the 
foaming surges and made the succeeding darkness doubly 
terrible. The thunders yelled over the wild waste of waters, and 
were echoed and prolonged by the mountain-sized waves. The 
ship was rising and falling among these roaring waves. Her yards 
would dip into the water: her bow was almost buried beneath the 
waves. Sometimes an impending surge appeared ready to 
overwhelm her.
