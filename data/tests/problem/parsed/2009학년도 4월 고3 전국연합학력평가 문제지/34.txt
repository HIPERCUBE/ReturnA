34.  “A long, long, long time ago...” ― so begins every Korean fairy 
tale. The repetition not only contributes to creating a stable, 
calm tone for the narrative but also reflects the “triple repetition” 
rule for Korean tales. The final repetition of “long” can 
sometimes be substituted with something like “back when tigers 
smoked pipes,” but it should never be omitted altogether. The 
rule of threes does not apply only to the beginning sentence but 
also to different elements throughout the story. For instance, in 
Kongjui and Patjui, the Korean version of the Cinderella story, 
Kongjui’s stepmother orders her to complete three impossible 
chores. And in the tale of Sister Sun and Brother Moon, three 
helpers each take turns rescuing the poor brother and sister from 
the tiger’s tormenting. Less than three is always too few; more 
than three is like too much frosting on a cake.
