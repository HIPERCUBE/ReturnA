42.  Rangers in Kenya have outfitted elephants with 
cellphone-and GPS-equipped collars that send warning 
messages when the pachyderms are about to raid farms. In 2006 
the rangers tested the collars on a repeat offender named 
Kimani, who had broken through electric fences 20 nights in a 
row and caused thousands of dollars in damage to crops and 
farm equipment. Most farmers had no idea that their field was 
being raided until the damage was done. Now Kimani’s collar 
texts his hourly position to a server in Nairobi, where software 
compares the animal’s location with a database of virtual borders 
established around villages and farms. If Kimani strays across 
one of those borders, the system alerts researchers and rangers 
in the area so they can coax him away from trouble.
