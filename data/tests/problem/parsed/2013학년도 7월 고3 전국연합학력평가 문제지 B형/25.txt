In Western culture, playing the masculine role has 
traditionally required traits such as independence, assertiveness, 
and dominance. Females are expected to be more nurturing and 
sensitive to other people. Are these masculine and feminine 
roles universal? Could biological differences between the sexes 
lead inevitably to gender differences in behavior? In 1935, 
anthropologist Margaret Mead compared the gender roles 
adopted by people in three tribal societies on the island of 
New Guinea, and her observations are certainly 
thought­provoking. In the Arapesh tribe, both men and women 
were taught to play what we would regard as a feminine role: 
They were cooperative, non­aggressive, and sensitive to the 
needs of others. Both men and women of the Mundugumor 
tribe were brought up to be aggressive and emotionally 
unresponsive to other people ─ a masculine pattern of behavior 
by Western standards. Finally, the Tchambuli tribe displayed a 
pattern of gender­role development that was the direct 
opposite of the Western pattern: Males were passive, 
emotionally dependent, and socially sensitive, whereas females 
were dominant, independent, and assertive.
