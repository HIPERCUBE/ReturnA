The biggest game­changer in our future is life 
prolongation. It works for mice and worms, and surely it 
will work for the rest of us some day. Biologists are now 
tinkering with so­called anti­aging substances, trying to get 
you the benefit of life prolongation. But, life gets its edge 
from the possibility of its ending. What will life be like 
when we live forever? No one dies. No one gets older. No 
more evolution. No need to hurry. If you want something 
done, give it to a busy man, but nobody needs to be busy 
when you have forever. Who is going to do the real work, 
then? Chosen people who will volunteer or be volunteered to 
be mortal. Life without death changes absolutely everything. 
If we want things to stay as they are, then things will have 
to change.
