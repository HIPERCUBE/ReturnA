33. In the command­and­control management model, plans were 
considered destiny. Top management formulated exacting plans 
for every aspect of operations and then kept everything under 
tight control to “meet the plan.” All too often, however, plans 
were derailed by unanticipated events. Planning is no longer the 
exclusive domain of top management; it now typically involves 
those who carry out the plans because they are closer to the 
customer. Planning experts, who recommend strategic agility, 
say managers need to                              to take 
advantage of opportunities. A good analogy of this would be an 
improvisational comedy act. The stand­up comic has a plan for 
the introduction, structure of the act, some tried­and­true jokes, 
and closing remarks. Within this planned framework, the comic 
will play off the audience’s input and improvise as necessary.
