36. When a certain word which is to be defined crops up in its 
own definition, we call it a circular definition. The point of 
defining a term is to explain its meaning; this obviously cannot   
be achieved if you need already to understand the meaning of   
the term in order to understand the definition.     
. For example, 
to define “stress” as “the physiological and psychological 
responses to stressful situations” would be to give a circular 
definition. This is because stressful situations are presumably   
only recognizable from the fact that they tend to produce 
stress: but the meaning of “stress” is the very thing which 
someone requesting the definition is seeking to understand, 
and so should not be presupposed in the definition. To define 
“philosophy” as “the activity carried out by philosophers” would 
be another example of a circular definition. [3점]
