32. Scientists and educators have long sought to understand 
the emergence of expertise, artistic and otherwise. Many 34
researchers have argued that exceptional achievement can a
simply come down to                     . Studies of eminent h
scientists in the 1950s supported this view by underscoring o
the individuals’ capacity for endurance, concentration and g
commitment to effortful practice. Benjamin Bloom, an education o
psychologist, wrote in 1985 that none of his subjects achieved t
expertise without a supportive environment and a long and t
intensive period of training. This education came first from a
encouraging instructors and later from demanding master l
teachers. A few years later psychologist K. Anders Ericsson p
of Florida State University conducted studies of experts in f
piano, violin, chess, or athletics. The investigations revealed a
that a person’s level of achievement correlated strongly with  
the amount of practice put in. a[

. In the command­and­control management model, plans were 
nsidered destiny. Top management formulated exacting plans 
r every aspect of operations and then kept everything under 
ht control to “meet the plan.” All too often, however, plans 
re derailed by unanticipated events. Planning is no longer the 
clusive domain of top management; it now typically involves 
ose who carry out the plans because they are closer to the 
stomer. Planning experts, who recommend strategic agility, 
y managers need to                              to take 
vantage of opportunities. A good analogy of this would be an 
provisational comedy act. The stand­up comic has a plan for 
e introduction, structure of the act, some tried­and­true jokes, 
d closing remarks. Within this planned framework, the comic 
ll play off the audience’s input and improvise as necessary.
