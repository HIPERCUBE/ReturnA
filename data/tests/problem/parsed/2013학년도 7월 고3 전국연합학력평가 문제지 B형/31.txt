31. The relationship between physical products and individual co
ownership is undergoing a profound evolution. We don’t want fo
the CD; we want the music it plays. We don’t want the disc; tig
we want the storage it holds. We don’t want the answering we
machine; we want the messages it saves. We don’t want the ex
DVD; we want the movie it carries. In other words, we want th
not the stuff but the needs or experiences it fulfills. As our cu
possessions “dematerialize” into the intangible, our sa
preconceptions of ownership are changing, creating a dotted ad
line between “what’s mine,” “what’s yours,” and “what’s im
ours.” This shift is fueling a world where             has th
more value than possession, and as Kevin Kelly, a founder of an
Wired magazine, puts it, where “access is better than wi
ownership.”
