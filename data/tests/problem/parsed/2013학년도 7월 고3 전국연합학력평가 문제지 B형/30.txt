Without question saffron is the most expensive spice in 
the world. Out of 100,000 to 250,000 handpicked plants, one 
pound of saffron is yielded. First found in the Near East in 
Asia Minor, it was used by the Persians as both a flavor 
enhancer and dye. The blue­violet and lily shaped flowers of 
the plant appear in autumn. At the center of these flowers 
are three blood­red stigmas, which are the saffron threads 
that form the spice. It is better to buy the stigma rather 
than powdered saffron because the powder may be already 
mixed with other ingredients. Very little should be used, not 
only because of the expense, but because too much can emit 
a medicinal taste. In Indian cooking it is used in pilafs and 
biryani dishes. Saffron is also found on the foreheads of 
Indian women denoting their social class.
