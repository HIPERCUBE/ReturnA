The decline in manufacturing will inevitably bring about a 
new protectionism. The first reaction to a period of 
turbulence is to try to build a wall that ① shields one’s own

Mexican economy ④ failed. Mexico actually became 
increasingly dependent on imports from other countries. It 
was finally ⑤ obliged to open itself to the outside world.
