In college, McCormack was a pretty amazing golfer. One 
day, ① he had the good fortune to play against future golfing 
legend Arnold Palmer. After ② his collegiate golf days, 
McCormack got a law degree, and his friend Palmer turned 
to him for legal advice. At the time, athletes were not the 
constant presence in pop culture and advertising as they are 
today. But McCormack noticed that professional athletes were 
like actors. And ③ he recognized that they had adoring fans 
who wanted to meet them in person and, possibly, use the 
products they used. As a lawyer, ④ he understood how 
agencies helped get endorsements for their actors. Using that 
model, he arranged for Palmer to play golf with heads of 
companies to connect ⑤ his image with products just like 
actors did. Before long, Palmer’s income jumped. Other 
golfers signed on, and McCormack created IMG, the first 
major sports management agency.
