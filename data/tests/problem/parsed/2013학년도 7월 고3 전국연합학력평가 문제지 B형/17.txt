One of the key fears we all have is fear that this is the   
wrong time to start whatever our project is, and we should 
wait until the “time is right.” Tim Ferriss, author of the 
bestselling book The 4­Hour Workweek, has this to say 
about timing: “For all the most important things, the timing 
is always wrong. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? 
The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will 
never all be green at the same time. Conditions are never 
perfect. ‘Someday’ is a disease that will take your dreams to 
the grave with you. If it’s important to you and you want to 
do it ‘eventually,’ just do it and correct course along the 
way.” If you wait for the timing to be right before you make 
a move, you may never make a move at all. 
① 원하는 일은 때를 기다리지 말고 바로 실행하라.
② 꿈을 실현하기 위한 구체적인 계획을 세워라.
③ 결과보다는 노력의 과정에 의미를 부여하라.
④ 성공을 위해 일의 우선순위를 정하라.
⑤ 과거의 실패에 얽매이지 마라.

The biggest game­changer in our future is life   
prolongation. It works for mice and worms, and surely it 26
will work for the rest of us some day. Biologists are now 
tinkering with so­called anti­aging substances, trying to get   
you the benefit of life prolongation. But, life gets its edge 
from the possibility of its ending. What will life be like 
when we live forever? No one dies. No one gets older. No 
more evolution. No need to hurry. If you want something 
done, give it to a busy man, but nobody needs to be busy 
when you have forever. Who is going to do the real work, 
then? Chosen people who will volunteer or be volunteered to 
be mortal. Life without death changes absolutely everything. 
If we want things to stay as they are, then things will have 
to change.
