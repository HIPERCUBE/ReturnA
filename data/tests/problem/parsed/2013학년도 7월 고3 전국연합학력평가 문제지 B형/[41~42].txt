For years, Switzerland had been trying to find a place to 
store radioactive nuclear waste. One location designated as 
a potential nuclear waste site was the small village of 
Wolfenschiessen. In 1993, some economists surveyed the 
residents of the village, asking whether they would vote to 
accept a nuclear waste repository, if the Swiss parliament 
decided to build it there. Although the facility was widely 
viewed as an undesirable addition to the neighborhood, a 
slim majority (51 percent) of residents said they would 
accept it. Apparently their sense of civic duty outweighed 
their concern about the risks. Then the economists added a 
sweetener: suppose parliament offered to compensate each 
resident with an annual monetary payment. Then would you 
favor it?
The result: support went down, not up. Adding the 
financial incentive cut the rate of acceptance in half, from 
51 to 25 percent. Even when the economists increased the 
monetary offer, the result was unchanged. Why would more 
people accept nuclear waste for free than for pay? Standard 
economic analysis suggests that offering people money to 
accept a burden would increase, not decrease their 
willingness to do so. But the economists who led the study 
point out that the price effect is sometimes invalidated by   
. For villagers, willingness to accept the 
nuclear waste site reflected public spirit ― a recognition 
that the country as a whole depended on nuclear energy 
and that the nuclear waste had to be stored somewhere. 
Against the background of this civic commitment, the 
offer of cash to residents of the village felt like a bribe, 
an effort to buy their vote.
