Mechanization was the key that unlocked the Industrial 
Revolution. In the ① pre-industrial period, manufacturing had 
been carried out by self-employed individuals in their homes, 
or in small workshops in which a craftsman oversaw the work 
of apprentices. Commonly, one person would undertake all the 
tasks ② involved in producing an item, from start to finish. 
However, the pioneering economist Adam Smith pointed out 
that this craft-based approach was ③ efficient. Taking the 
example of a pin factory, Smith said that one man working 
alone would ④ struggle to complete one pin a day, whereas if 
ten different workers each undertook one stage in the process, 
the factory might produce 48,000 pins a day. Such a ⑤ division 
of labour, Smith argued, also encouraged the development of 
new machinery.

Suddenly everyone was startled by the children running 
toward their grandmother, screaming and shouting in terror, “A 
bear! A bear!” The grandmother called to all the children to run 
as fast as possible for home. When the children had all started 
for home, the grandmother ran too. Shouting to the children not 
to stop running, she turned around and saw that the bear was 
very close to her. She soon realized that she could never outrun 
the animal. She must do something. Turning suddenly, she 
pointed an umbrella straight at the bear. To her surprise the 
bear stopped, though he still growled. The grandmother, seeing 
the bear’s fright, held the umbrella aimed at him, and to her 
great relief he turned around in the path and fled out of sight.
① happy → sorrowful ② frightened → relieved
③ surprised → depressed ④ nervous → disappointed

34. Thinking is hard work. If you do not keep your working 
memory clear, then you are weakening your ability to think 
about what is going on in your class or meeting. This might 
seem obvious, but if you look around the room at many 
meetings, you will find yourself face-to-face with one of the 
true demons of modern life: multitasking. Sitting in a meeting, 
you will see that some people are taking care of work that is 
unrelated to the current meeting. Others are checking their 
e-mail. Still others are reading. Each of these activities takes 
up your working memory. You cannot maximize the quality of 
the new knowledge you are taking in if you do not give 
yourself every opportunity to                                  . [3점]
① pay attention ② share experiences
③ boost confidence  ④ assign responsibility
⑤ develop personality 
35. In seeking goals, it is important to know about the 
“eleventh hour.” Have you ever noticed in life that things 
can look really gloomy just before a dramatic turn for the 
better? A successful businessman reports that just before 
he made his fortune, he was about to quit. He was up the 
creek without a paddle when, suddenly, everything began to 
fall into place. He held out to the end to get his payoff. 
Perhaps you have had this experience; when wondering if 
life was worth all the effort, you met somebody who made 
the dark clouds go away. Life is like that because there is 
a principle at work here ─ the “eleventh hour” principle. It 
is always darkest and coldest just before dawn. But if we   
, we will get our rewards. [3점]
① remain punctual ② set realistic goals  
③ hang on long enough ④ enjoy new experiences 
⑤ do good deeds in secret 
36. Ideas sometimes occur                                                   . 
This is how the idea for Harry Potter came to author J. K. 
Rowling. She was taking a long train journey from Manchester 
to London and the idea for Harry just fell into her head. 
Another recent example is Trevor Bayliss’s human-powered 
windup radio. This idea suddenly “hit” him after he had been 
watching a television program about the alarming spread of 
AIDS in Africa. The program had mentioned the problem of 
providing education to prevent the disease in isolated regions 
without electrical power. In an instant he realized that a windup 
radio could help to solve the problem. Straight away he went 
into his workshop and began working on the idea. [3점]

If you can find a pattern, rule, or underlying principle in the 
material, you will likely be able to learn it more easily.    
(A)       , if you arrange the number 376315374264 in four 
groups of three, it is easier to remember (376-315-374
-264). The task is even easier if you can see some patterns or 
relationships among the four groups. The first three groups all 
start with 3, and the first and third groups both have a 7 next; 
the second digits in the last two groups are only one digit apart 
(7 and 6), and the last digit is the same (4). Noticing such 
patterns helps make the number more meaningful.     (B)      , 
looking for patterns in phone numbers, addresses, dates, or any 
other numbers will help you remember them.

Our ability to recognize and respond to discomfort is critical 
for preventing physical damage to the body. ① Consider how 
often you shift position in your chair when you are studying or 
sitting in a lecture. ② If you were unable to receive signals of 
discomfort from your body, you would not move to relieve 
pressure on your skin. ③ Movement or noise in the classroom 
may distract the students from their work. ④ The parts of 
your skin under continuous pressure would develop sores or 
bruises. ⑤ Since many everyday experiences would be 
damaging to our bodies if we were not able to detect discomfort, 
a lack of ability to detect pain could cause serious problems.

Then there came a knock at the door and, “Santa Claus!” shouted the children.
Even when the father of seven children had been injured and 
was in the hospital, the children were sure that Santa Claus 
would fill their stockings. ( ① ) To the mother, the situation 
was desperate, because the family needed food and clothing, 
and there were long weeks ahead before her husband could 
leave the hospital. ( ② ) While the children talked about roller 
skates, dolls and Christmas trees, she was trying to figure out 
how to keep the home going. ( ③ ) It was not Santa Claus, but 
Mr. Adams, who lived next door, with a smile extending clear 
across his face. ( ④ ) He carried a bag filled with toys in his 
arms. ( ⑤ ) Behind him stood the whole neighborhood, bringing 
toys and food and clothing; enough to carry the family through 
the weeks ahead.
