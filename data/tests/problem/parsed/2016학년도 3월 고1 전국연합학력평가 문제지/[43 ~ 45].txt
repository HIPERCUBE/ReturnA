(A) 
Families don’t grow strong unless parents invest 
precious time in them. In New Man, Gary Oliver writes 
about a difficult decision made by professional baseball 
player Tim Burke concerning his family. From the time 
Tim can first remember, his dream was to be a 
professional baseball player. Through years of hard work 
(a) he achieved that goal.
(B) 
When Tim left the stadium for the last time, a 
reporter stopped him. And then (b) he asked why he 
was retiring. “Baseball is going to do just fine without 
me,” he said to the reporter. “It’s not going to miss a 
beat. But I’m the only father my children have and I’m 
the only husband my wife has. And they need me a lot 
more than baseball does.”
(C) 
While he was a successful pitcher for the Montreal 
Expos, (c) he and his wife wanted to start a family but 
discovered that they were unable to have children. After 
much thought, they decided to adopt four special­needs 
international children. This led to one of the most 
difficult decisions of Tim’s life.
(D) 
He discovered that his life on the road conflicted with 
his ability to be a quality husband and dad. Over time, it 
became clear that (d) he couldn’t do a good job at both. 
After more thought, he made what many considered an 
unbelievable decision: (e) he decided to give up 
professional baseball.
