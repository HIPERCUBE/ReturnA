But there will be times in your life when there is no 
one around to stand up and cheer you on.
It’s great to have people in your life who believe in you 
and cheer you on. ( ① ) They are truly interested in what 
you are trying to achieve and support you in all of your 
goals and efforts. ( ② ) Each of us needs people in our 
lives who encourage us so that we can feel confident in our 
capabilities and move forward toward our goals. ( ③ ) When 
this happens, don’t get depressed. ( ④ ) Instead, become 
your own cheerleader. ( ⑤ ) Give yourself a motivational 
pep talk because nobody knows your strengths and talents 
better than you and no one can motivate you better than 
you.
