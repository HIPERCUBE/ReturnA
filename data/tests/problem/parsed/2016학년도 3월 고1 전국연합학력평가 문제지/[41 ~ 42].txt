Food is one of the most important tools you can use 
as a manager. Having a full stomach makes people feel 
satisfied and happier. Eating together gives employees 
time to make connections with each other. Providing an 
occasional snack or paying for a lunch now and then can 
help your employees feel appreciated and make the 
office feel more welcoming. These do not need to be 
elaborate setups. If you have a small budget, you’re not 
going to want to buy lunch at a restaurant for your 
entire group. Bringing in some cookies once in a while is 
enough; you can also encourage employees to bring in 
food themselves.
The key to using food effectively is for it not to 
become a            event. If everyone knows you bring 
donuts to the Friday morning meeting, it becomes an 
expectation and not a surprise. To create goodwill, the 
food must appear to be unexpected. It is also a good 
idea to praise employees who bring food in without 
being asked; this creates an atmosphere of sharing.
