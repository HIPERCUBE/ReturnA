31. Recently on a flight to Asia, I met Debbie, who was 
warmly greeted by all of the flight attendants and was even 
welcomed aboard the plane by the pilot. Amazed at all the 
attention being paid to her, I asked if she worked with the 
airline. She did not, but she deserved the attention, for this 
flight marked the milestone of her flying over 4 million 
miles with this same airline. During the flight I learned that 
the airline’s CEO personally called her to thank her for using 
their service for a long time and she received a catalogue of 
fine luxury gifts to choose from. Debbie was able to acquire 
this special treatment for one very important reason: she 
was a           customer to that one airline. [3점]
