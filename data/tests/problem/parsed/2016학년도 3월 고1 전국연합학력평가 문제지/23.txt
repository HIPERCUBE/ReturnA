Give children options and allow them to make their own 
decisions ― on how much they would like to eat, whether 
they want to eat or not, and what they would like to have. 
For example, include them in the decision­making process of 
what you are thinking of making for dinner ― “Lisa, would 
you like to have pasta and meatballs, or chicken and a baked 
potato?” When discussing how much they should eat during 
dinner, serve them a reasonable amount; if they claim they 
are still “hungry” after they are through, ask them to wait 
five to ten minutes, and if they continue to feel hunger, 
then they can have a second plate of food. These are 
fantastic behaviors that, when taught properly, teach brilliant 
self­confidence and self­control.
