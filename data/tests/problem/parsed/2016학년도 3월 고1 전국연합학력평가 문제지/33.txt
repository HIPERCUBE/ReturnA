33. When you’re eager to get your slice of the pie, why would 
you be interested in giving a hand to other people so that 
they can get their piece? If Ernest Hamwi had taken that 
attitude when he was selling zalabia, a very thin Persian 
waffle, at the 1904 World’s Fair, he might have ended his 
days as a street vendor. Hamwi noticed that a nearby 
ice­cream vendor ran out of bowls to serve to his customers. 
Most people would have sniffed, “Not my problem,” perhaps 
even hoping the ice­cream vendor’s misfortune would mean 
more customers for them. Instead, Hamwi rolled up a waffle 
and put a scoop of ice cream on top, creating one of the 
world’s first ice­cream cones. He                 and, in the 
process, made a fortune. [3점]
