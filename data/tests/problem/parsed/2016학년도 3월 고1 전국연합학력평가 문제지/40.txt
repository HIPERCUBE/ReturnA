Children are much more resistant to giving something 
to someone else than to helping them. One can observe 
this difference clearly in very young children. Even 
though one­and­a­half­year­olds will support each other in 
difficult situations, they are not willing to share their 
own toys with others. The little ones even defend their 
possessions with screams and, if necessary, blows. This 
is the daily experience of parents troubled by constant 
quarreling between toddlers. There was no word I heard 
more frequently than “Mine!” from my daughters when 
they were still in diapers.
