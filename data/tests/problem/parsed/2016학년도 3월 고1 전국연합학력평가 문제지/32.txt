32. Some of the most extensive research on the subject of 
success was conducted by George and Alec Gallup. They 
interviewed people acknowledged as successful in a wide 
variety of areas: business, science,  literature, education, 
religion, etc. The goal of the researchers was to determine 
what these high­achieving people had in common. There was 
one thing they all had in common: the willingness to          
. All of them agreed that success wasn’t 
something that had just happened to them due to luck or 
special talents. It happened because they’d made it happen 
through continuous effort. Instead of looking for shortcuts and 
ways to avoid hard work, these people welcomed it as a 
necessary part of the process. [3점]
