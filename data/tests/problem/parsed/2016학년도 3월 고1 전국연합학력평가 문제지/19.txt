I heard something moving slowly along the walls. I 
searched for a match in the dark and tried to strike it, but 
it wouldn’t light. This time I was certain: Something was 
moving in the tunnels, something alive, and it wasn’t a rat. 
A very unpleasant smell came into my nostrils. Finally, I 
managed to light a match. At first I was blinded by the 
flame; then I saw something creeping toward me. From all 
the tunnels. Shapeless figures crawling like spiders. The 
match fell from my trembling fingers. I wanted to start 
running, but I couldn’t.
