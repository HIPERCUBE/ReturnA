Kaspar Fürstenau was a German flutist and composer. 
After he was orphaned, Anton Romberg took care of him and 
taught him to play the bassoon, but Fürstenau was more 
interested in the flute. At the age of 15, he was already a 
skilled flutist and played in a military band. In 1793-94, 
Fürstenau made his first concert tour in Germany. In 1794, 
he became a member of the “Chamber Orchestra of 
Oldenburg,” where he played until the orchestra was 
abolished in 1811. Kaspar Fürstenau continued his career as 
a flutist performing together with his son Anton Fürstenau in 
the major cities of Europe.

33. When you’re eager to get your slice of the pie, why would 
you be interested in giving a hand to other people so that 
they can get their piece? If Ernest Hamwi had taken that 
attitude when he was selling zalabia, a very thin Persian 
waffle, at the 1904 World’s Fair, he might have ended his 
days as a street vendor. Hamwi noticed that a nearby 
ice­cream vendor ran out of bowls to serve to his customers. 
Most people would have sniffed, “Not my problem,” perhaps 
even hoping the ice­cream vendor’s misfortune would mean 
more customers for them. Instead, Hamwi rolled up a waffle 
and put a scoop of ice cream on top, creating one of the 
world’s first ice­cream cones. He                 and, in the 
process, made a fortune. [3점]

What’s happening when we’re actually doing two things at 
once? It’s simple. Our brain has channels, and so we’re able 
to process different kinds of data in different parts of our 
brain.     (A)    , you can talk and walk at the same time. 
There is no channel interference. But you’re not really 
focused on both activities. One is happening in the 
foreground and the other in the background. If you were 
trying to explain on the cell phone how to operate a 
complex machine, you’d stop walking.     (B)    , if you 
were crossing a rope bridge over a valley, you’d likely stop 
talking. You can do two things at once, but you can’t focus 
effectively on two things at once.

Maybe you have watched the sun as it was setting in 
the sky. Sometimes it looks as though it is on fire, 
especially when it is shining through the clouds.
(A) But what may surprise you even more is there are 
many stars in the universe that are thousands of times 
hotter than the sun.
(B) The reason it looks that way is that the sun is on fire. 
Can you guess how hot the fire at the center of the 
sun is? 
(C) It is more than 25 million degrees on the Fahrenheit 
scale! That’s 250,000 times hotter than the hottest 
summer day at your favorite amusement park. [3점]

I did a television show once with Louis Armstrong. All 
of a sudden, as Louis was playing, a fly landed on his 
nose. 
(A) They didn’t want to let their laughter out and ruin his 
performance. When Louis finished, everybody burst into 
laughter. 
(B) So he blew it off. He kept singing, and the fly landed 
back on his nose. So he blew it off again. It was being 
taped, and everyone in the audience tried not to show 
they were laughing.
(C) And then the director came out and said: “Let’s do one 
more take without the fly.” But that was the take he 
should have put on TV.

According to him, however, entertainers who are alive 
are not included. 
Most dictionaries list names of famous people. ( ① ) The 
editors must make difficult decisions about whom to include 
and whom to exclude. ( ② ) Webster’s New World 
Dictionary, for example, includes Audrey Hepburn but leaves 
out Spencer Tracy. ( ③ ) It lists Bing Crosby, not Bob 
Hope; Willie Mays, not Micky Mantle. ( ④ ) Executive 
editor Michael Agnes explains that names are chosen based 
on their frequency of use and their usefulness to the reader. 
( ⑤ ) For that very reason, Elton John and Paul McCartney 
aren’t in the dictionary, but both Marilyn Monroe and Elvis 
Presley, who died decades ago, are.

But there will be times in your life when there is no 
one around to stand up and cheer you on.
It’s great to have people in your life who believe in you 
and cheer you on. ( ① ) They are truly interested in what 
you are trying to achieve and support you in all of your 
goals and efforts. ( ② ) Each of us needs people in our 
lives who encourage us so that we can feel confident in our 
capabilities and move forward toward our goals. ( ③ ) When 
this happens, don’t get depressed. ( ④ ) Instead, become 
your own cheerleader. ( ⑤ ) Give yourself a motivational 
pep talk because nobody knows your strengths and talents 
better than you and no one can motivate you better than 
you.

The water that is embedded in our food and manufactured 
products is called “virtual water.” For example, about 265 
gallons of water is needed to produce two pounds of wheat. 
① So, the virtual water of these two pounds of wheat is 
265 gallons. ② Virtual water is also present in dairy 
products, soups, beverages, and liquid medicines. ③ However, 
it is necessary to drink as much water as possible to stay 
healthy. ④ Every day, humans consume lots of virtual water 
and the content of virtual water varies according to 
products. ⑤ For instance, to produce two pounds of meat 
requires about 5 to 10 times as much water as to produce 
two pounds of vegetables.

Children are much more resistant to giving something 
to someone else than to helping them. One can observe 
this difference clearly in very young children. Even 
though one­and­a­half­year­olds will support each other in 
difficult situations, they are not willing to share their 
own toys with others. The little ones even defend their 
possessions with screams and, if necessary, blows. This 
is the daily experience of parents troubled by constant 
quarreling between toddlers. There was no word I heard 
more frequently than “Mine!” from my daughters when 
they were still in diapers.
