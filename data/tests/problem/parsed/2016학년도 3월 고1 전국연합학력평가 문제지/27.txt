Kaspar Fürstenau was a German flutist and composer. 
After he was orphaned, Anton Romberg took care of him and 
taught him to play the bassoon, but Fürstenau was more 
interested in the flute. At the age of 15, he was already a 
skilled flutist and played in a military band. In 1793-94, 
Fürstenau made his first concert tour in Germany. In 1794, 
he became a member of the “Chamber Orchestra of 
Oldenburg,” where he played until the orchestra was 
abolished in 1811. Kaspar Fürstenau continued his career as 
a flutist performing together with his son Anton Fürstenau in 
the major cities of Europe.
