Dear citizens,
As you all know from seeing the pictures on 
television and in the newspaper, Central America has 
been hit hard by a series of hurricanes. Tens of 
thousands of people are homeless and without basic 
necessities like food and clothing. I feel that we need 
to do something to help. So, we are asking you to 
donate canned goods, warm clothes, blankets, and 
money. Please bring all donations to the community 
center between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., Saturday, 
September 10. Thank you for helping your fellow 
human beings in their time of desperate need.
Sincerely,
George Anderson

19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
I heard something moving slowly along the walls. I 
searched for a match in the dark and tried to strike it, but 
it wouldn’t light. This time I was certain: Something was 
moving in the tunnels, something alive, and it wasn’t a rat. 
A very unpleasant smell came into my nostrils. Finally, I 
managed to light a match. At first I was blinded by the 
flame; then I saw something creeping toward me. From all 
the tunnels. Shapeless figures crawling like spiders. The 
match fell from my trembling fingers. I wanted to start 
running, but I couldn’t.
* nostril: 콧구멍
① frightened ② delighted ③ depressed
④ jealous ⑤ relieved
20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Since you can’t use gestures, make faces, or present an 
object to readers in writing, you must rely on words to do 
both the telling and the showing. Show more than you tell. 
Use words to make the reader see. For example, don’t leave 
the reader guessing about Laura’s beautiful hair. Show how 
the gentle wind touches the edge of her silky, brown hair. 
Don’t just say you felt happy. Show yourself leaping down 
the steps four at a time, coat unzipped, shouting in the 
wind, “Hurray, I did it!”
① 글을 쓰기 전에 주변을 정돈해야 한다.

④ 글의 내용과 어울리는 그림을 제시해야 한다.  
⑤ 마음속에 있는 것을 진솔하게 글에 담아야 한다. 
21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
It is important to recognize your pet’s particular needs and 
respect them. If your pet is an athletic, high­energy dog, for 
example, he or she is going to be much more manageable 
indoors if you take him or her outside to chase a ball for an 
hour every day. If your cat is shy and timid, he or she 
won’t want to be dressed up and displayed in cat shows. 
Similarly, you cannot expect macaws to be quiet and still all 
the time ― they are, by nature, loud and emotional creatures, 
and it is not their fault that your apartment doesn’t absorb 
sound as well as a rain forest.
* macaw: 마코 앵무새
① 애완동물에게는 적절한 운동이 필요하다.
② 애완동물도 다양한 감정을 느낄 수 있다.
③ 애완동물의 개별적 특성을 존중해야 한다.
④ 자신의 상황에 맞는 애완동물을 선택해야 한다.
⑤ 훈련을 통해 애완동물의 행동을 교정할 수 있다. 
22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Hydroelectric power is a clean and renewable power 
source. However, there are a few things about dams that are 
important to know. To build a hydroelectric dam, a large 
area must be flooded behind the dam. Whole communities 
sometimes have to be moved to another place. Entire forests 
can be drowned. The water released from the dam can be 
colder than usual and this can affect the ecosystems in the 
rivers downstream. It can also wash away riverbanks and 
destroy life on the river bottoms. The worst effect of dams 
has been observed on salmon that have to travel upstream 
to lay their eggs. If blocked by a dam, the salmon life cycle 
cannot be completed.
* hydroelectric: 수력 발전의  ** ecosystem: 생태계
① necessity of saving energy
② dark sides of hydroelectric dams
③ types of hydroelectric power plants
④ popularity of renewable power sources
⑤ importance of protecting the environment 
23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Give children options and allow them to make their own 
decisions ― on how much they would like to eat, whether 
they want to eat or not, and what they would like to have. 
For example, include them in the decision­making process of 
what you are thinking of making for dinner ― “Lisa, would 
you like to have pasta and meatballs, or chicken and a baked 
potato?” When discussing how much they should eat during 
dinner, serve them a reasonable amount; if they claim they 
are still “hungry” after they are through, ask them to wait 
five to ten minutes, and if they continue to feel hunger, 
then they can have a second plate of food. These are 
fantastic behaviors that, when taught properly, teach brilliant 
self­confidence and self­control.
① Be a Role Model to Your Children
② Hunger: The Best Sauce for Children
③ Table Manners: Are They Important?
④ Good Nutrition: Children’s Brain Power
⑤ Teach Children Food Independence

27. Kaspar Fürstenau에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
Kaspar Fürstenau was a German flutist and composer. 
After he was orphaned, Anton Romberg took care of him and 
taught him to play the bassoon, but Fürstenau was more 
interested in the flute. At the age of 15, he was already a 
skilled flutist and played in a military band. In 1793-94, 
Fürstenau made his first concert tour in Germany. In 1794, 
he became a member of the “Chamber Orchestra of 
Oldenburg,” where he played until the orchestra was 
abolished in 1811. Kaspar Fürstenau continued his career as 
a flutist performing together with his son Anton Fürstenau in 
the major cities of Europe. 
* abolish: (단체 등을) 없애다
① 독일의 플루트 연주자이자 작곡가였다.  
② 고아가 된 후 Anton Romberg의 보살핌을 받았다.
③ 15세에 군악대에서 연주했다.
④ 1811년에 Chamber Orchestra of Oldenburg의 일원이 되었다.
⑤ 아들과 함께 유럽의 주요 도시에서 공연했다.
28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Your parents may be afraid that you will not spend your 
allowance wisely. You may make some foolish spending 
choices, but if you ① do, the decision to do so is your own 
and hopefully you will learn from your mistakes. Much of 
learning ② occurs through trial and error. Explain to your 
parents that money is something you will have to deal with 
for the rest of your life. It is better ③ what you make 
your mistakes early on rather than later in life. Explain 
that you will have a family someday and you need to know 
how ④ to manage your money. Not everything ⑤ is taught 
at school! 
29. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적
절한 것은?
In most people, emotions are situational. Something in 
the here and now makes you mad. The emotion itself is 
(A) tied / unrelated  to the situation in which it originates. 
As long as you remain in that emotional situation, you’re 
likely to stay angry. If you leave the situation, the opposite 
is true. The emotion begins to (B) disappear / appear  as 
soon as you move away from the situation. Moving away 
from the situation prevents it from taking hold of you. 
Counselors often advise clients to get some emotional 
distance from whatever is (C) bothering / pleasing  them. 
One easy way to do that is to geographically separate 
yourself from the source of your anger.
(A) (B) (C)
① tied …… disappear …… bothering
② tied …… disappear …… pleasing
③ tied …… appear …… bothering
④ unrelated …… disappear …… pleasing
⑤ unrelated …… appear …… pleasing
30. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Six­month­old Angela is sitting in her high chair during 
lunch and sees her bottle on the table. ① She is pretty tired
― it’s been a tough day! ― and she wants her bottle. She 
looks at it as her mother, Sophie, feeds ② her and gets 
more and more frustrated. Eventually, she turns away from 
her mother’s spoonfuls, arches her back, turns around in her 
high chair, and vocalizes as if ③ she is about to cry. Sophie 
is clueless about what Angela wants. When Sophie happens 
to look at the table for another reason, ④ she notices the 
bottle on it. “That’s what you want,” she says, and gives 
Angela ⑤ her bottle. Success at last!

31. Recently on a flight to Asia, I met Debbie, who was 
warmly greeted by all of the flight attendants and was even 
welcomed aboard the plane by the pilot. Amazed at all the 
attention being paid to her, I asked if she worked with the 
airline. She did not, but she deserved the attention, for this 
flight marked the milestone of her flying over 4 million 
miles with this same airline. During the flight I learned that 
the airline’s CEO personally called her to thank her for using 
their service for a long time and she received a catalogue of 
fine luxury gifts to choose from. Debbie was able to acquire 
this special treatment for one very important reason: she 
was a           customer to that one airline. [3점]
* milestone: 획기적인 사건
① courageous ② loyal ③ complaining
④ dangerous ⑤ temporary 
32. Some of the most extensive research on the subject of 
success was conducted by George and Alec Gallup. They 
interviewed people acknowledged as successful in a wide 
variety of areas: business, science,  literature, education, 
religion, etc. The goal of the researchers was to determine 
what these high­achieving people had in common. There was 
one thing they all had in common: the willingness to          
. All of them agreed that success wasn’t 
something that had just happened to them due to luck or 
special talents. It happened because they’d made it happen 
through continuous effort. Instead of looking for shortcuts and 
ways to avoid hard work, these people welcomed it as a 
necessary part of the process. [3점]
① take a risk
② make plans ahead  
③ get rid of bad habits 
④ work long, hard hours
⑤ respect others’ opinions 
33. When you’re eager to get your slice of the pie, why would 
you be interested in giving a hand to other people so that 
they can get their piece? If Ernest Hamwi had taken that 
attitude when he was selling zalabia, a very thin Persian 
waffle, at the 1904 World’s Fair, he might have ended his 
days as a street vendor. Hamwi noticed that a nearby 
ice­cream vendor ran out of bowls to serve to his customers. 
Most people would have sniffed, “Not my problem,” perhaps 
even hoping the ice­cream vendor’s misfortune would mean 
more customers for them. Instead, Hamwi rolled up a waffle 
and put a scoop of ice cream on top, creating one of the 
world’s first ice­cream cones. He                 and, in the 
process, made a fortune. [3점]

① opened a new shop
② helped his neighbor
③ joined the big event
④ kept his recipe secret
⑤ learned from his failure

What’s happening when we’re actually doing two things at 
once? It’s simple. Our brain has channels, and so we’re able 
to process different kinds of data in different parts of our 
brain.     (A)    , you can talk and walk at the same time. 
There is no channel interference. But you’re not really 
focused on both activities. One is happening in the 
foreground and the other in the background. If you were 
trying to explain on the cell phone how to operate a 
complex machine, you’d stop walking.     (B)    , if you 
were crossing a rope bridge over a valley, you’d likely stop 
talking. You can do two things at once, but you can’t focus 
effectively on two things at once.

Maybe you have watched the sun as it was setting in 
the sky. Sometimes it looks as though it is on fire, 
especially when it is shining through the clouds.
(A) But what may surprise you even more is there are 
many stars in the universe that are thousands of times 
hotter than the sun.
(B) The reason it looks that way is that the sun is on fire. 
Can you guess how hot the fire at the center of the 
sun is? 
(C) It is more than 25 million degrees on the Fahrenheit

I did a television show once with Louis Armstrong. All 
of a sudden, as Louis was playing, a fly landed on his 
nose. 
(A) They didn’t want to let their laughter out and ruin his 
performance. When Louis finished, everybody burst into 
laughter. 
(B) So he blew it off. He kept singing, and the fly landed 
back on his nose. So he blew it off again. It was being 
taped, and everyone in the audience tried not to show 
they were laughing.
(C) And then the director came out and said: “Let’s do one 
more take without the fly.” But that was the take he 
should have put on TV.

According to him, however, entertainers who are alive 
are not included. 
Most dictionaries list names of famous people. ( ① ) The 
editors must make difficult decisions about whom to include 
and whom to exclude. ( ② ) Webster’s New World 
Dictionary, for example, includes Audrey Hepburn but leaves 
out Spencer Tracy. ( ③ ) It lists Bing Crosby, not Bob 
Hope; Willie Mays, not Micky Mantle. ( ④ ) Executive 
editor Michael Agnes explains that names are chosen based 
on their frequency of use and their usefulness to the reader. 
( ⑤ ) For that very reason, Elton John and Paul McCartney 
aren’t in the dictionary, but both Marilyn Monroe and Elvis 
Presley, who died decades ago, are.

But there will be times in your life when there is no 
one around to stand up and cheer you on.
It’s great to have people in your life who believe in you 
and cheer you on. ( ① ) They are truly interested in what 
you are trying to achieve and support you in all of your 
goals and efforts. ( ② ) Each of us needs people in our 
lives who encourage us so that we can feel confident in our 
capabilities and move forward toward our goals. ( ③ ) When 
this happens, don’t get depressed. ( ④ ) Instead, become 
your own cheerleader. ( ⑤ ) Give yourself a motivational 
pep talk because nobody knows your strengths and talents 
better than you and no one can motivate you better than 
you.

The water that is embedded in our food and manufactured 
products is called “virtual water.” For example, about 265 
gallons of water is needed to produce two pounds of wheat. 
① So, the virtual water of these two pounds of wheat is 
265 gallons. ② Virtual water is also present in dairy 
products, soups, beverages, and liquid medicines. ③ However, 
it is necessary to drink as much water as possible to stay 
healthy. ④ Every day, humans consume lots of virtual water 
and the content of virtual water varies according to 
products. ⑤ For instance, to produce two pounds of meat 
requires about 5 to 10 times as much water as to produce 
two pounds of vegetables.

Children are much more resistant to giving something 
to someone else than to helping them. One can observe 
this difference clearly in very young children. Even 
though one­and­a­half­year­olds will support each other in 
difficult situations, they are not willing to share their 
own toys with others. The little ones even defend their 
possessions with screams and, if necessary, blows. This 
is the daily experience of parents troubled by constant 
quarreling between toddlers. There was no word I heard 
more frequently than “Mine!” from my daughters when 
they were still in diapers. 
* toddler: (걸음마를 배우는) 아기

Food is one of the most important tools you can use 
as a manager. Having a full stomach makes people feel 
satisfied and happier. Eating together gives employees 
time to make connections with each other. Providing an 
occasional snack or paying for a lunch now and then can 
help your employees feel appreciated and make the 
office feel more welcoming. These do not need to be 
elaborate setups. If you have a small budget, you’re not 
going to want to buy lunch at a restaurant for your 
entire group. Bringing in some cookies once in a while is 
enough; you can also encourage employees to bring in 
food themselves.
The key to using food effectively is for it not to 
become a            event. If everyone knows you bring 
donuts to the Friday morning meeting, it becomes an 
expectation and not a surprise. To create goodwill, the 
food must appear to be unexpected. It is also a good 
idea to praise employees who bring food in without 
being asked; this creates an atmosphere of sharing.
* elaborate: 공들인

Families don’t grow strong unless parents invest 
precious time in them. In New Man, Gary Oliver writes 
about a difficult decision made by professional baseball 
player Tim Burke concerning his family. From the time 
Tim can first remember, his dream was to be a 
professional baseball player. Through years of hard work 
(a) he achieved that goal.
(B) 
When Tim left the stadium for the last time, a 
reporter stopped him. And then (b) he asked why he 
was retiring. “Baseball is going to do just fine without 
me,” he said to the reporter. “It’s not going to miss a 
beat. But I’m the only father my children have and I’m 
the only husband my wife has. And they need me a lot 
more than baseball does.”
(C) 
While he was a successful pitcher for the Montreal 
Expos, (c) he and his wife wanted to start a family but 
discovered that they were unable to have children. After 
much thought, they decided to adopt four special­needs 
international children. This led to one of the most 
difficult decisions of Tim’s life.
(D) 
He discovered that his life on the road conflicted with 
his ability to be a quality husband and dad. Over time, it 
became clear that (d) he couldn’t do a good job at both. 
After more thought, he made what many considered an 
unbelievable decision: (e) he decided to give up 
professional baseball.
