Hydroelectric power is a clean and renewable power 
source. However, there are a few things about dams that are 
important to know. To build a hydroelectric dam, a large 
area must be flooded behind the dam. Whole communities 
sometimes have to be moved to another place. Entire forests 
can be drowned. The water released from the dam can be 
colder than usual and this can affect the ecosystems in the 
rivers downstream. It can also wash away riverbanks and 
destroy life on the river bottoms. The worst effect of dams 
has been observed on salmon that have to travel upstream 
to lay their eggs. If blocked by a dam, the salmon life cycle 
cannot be completed.
