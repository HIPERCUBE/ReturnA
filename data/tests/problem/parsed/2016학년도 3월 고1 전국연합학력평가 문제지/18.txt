Dear citizens,
As you all know from seeing the pictures on 
television and in the newspaper, Central America has 
been hit hard by a series of hurricanes. Tens of 
thousands of people are homeless and without basic 
necessities like food and clothing. I feel that we need 
to do something to help. So, we are asking you to 
donate canned goods, warm clothes, blankets, and 
money. Please bring all donations to the community 
center between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., Saturday, 
September 10. Thank you for helping your fellow 
human beings in their time of desperate need.
Sincerely,
George Anderson
