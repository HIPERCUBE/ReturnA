I did a television show once with Louis Armstrong. All 
of a sudden, as Louis was playing, a fly landed on his 
nose. 
(A) They didn’t want to let their laughter out and ruin his 
performance. When Louis finished, everybody burst into 
laughter. 
(B) So he blew it off. He kept singing, and the fly landed 
back on his nose. So he blew it off again. It was being 
taped, and everyone in the audience tried not to show 
they were laughing.
(C) And then the director came out and said: “Let’s do one 
more take without the fly.” But that was the take he 
should have put on TV.
