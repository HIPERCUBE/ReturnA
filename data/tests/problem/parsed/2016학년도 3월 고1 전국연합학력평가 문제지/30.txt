Six­month­old Angela is sitting in her high chair during 
lunch and sees her bottle on the table. ① She is pretty tired
― it’s been a tough day! ― and she wants her bottle. She 
looks at it as her mother, Sophie, feeds ② her and gets 
more and more frustrated. Eventually, she turns away from 
her mother’s spoonfuls, arches her back, turns around in her 
high chair, and vocalizes as if ③ she is about to cry. Sophie 
is clueless about what Angela wants. When Sophie happens 
to look at the table for another reason, ④ she notices the 
bottle on it. “That’s what you want,” she says, and gives 
Angela ⑤ her bottle. Success at last!
