The water that is embedded in our food and manufactured 
products is called “virtual water.” For example, about 265 
gallons of water is needed to produce two pounds of wheat. 
① So, the virtual water of these two pounds of wheat is 
265 gallons. ② Virtual water is also present in dairy 
products, soups, beverages, and liquid medicines. ③ However, 
it is necessary to drink as much water as possible to stay 
healthy. ④ Every day, humans consume lots of virtual water 
and the content of virtual water varies according to 
products. ⑤ For instance, to produce two pounds of meat 
requires about 5 to 10 times as much water as to produce 
two pounds of vegetables.
