The extraordinary expansion of food production by 
aquafarming has come with high costs to the environment and 
human health. As with industrialized agriculture, most 
commercial aquafarming relies on high energy and chemical 
inputs, including antibiotics and artificial feeds made from the 
wastes of poultry processing. Such production practices tend to 
concentrate toxins in farmed fish, creating a potential health 
threat to consumers. The discharge from fish farms, which can 
be equivalent to the sewage from a small city, can pollute 
nearby natural aquatic ecosystems. Around the tropics, 
especially tropical Asia, the expansion of commercial shrimp 
farms is contributing to the loss of highly biodiverse coastal 
mangrove forests.
