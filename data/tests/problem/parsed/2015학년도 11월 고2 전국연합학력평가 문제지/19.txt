Anna received a cute handkerchief as a gift for her tenth 
birthday. Accidentally an inkpot fell onto her beloved 
handkerchief causing a huge ugly spot. Anna was heartbroken 
when she saw the hideous stain. When her uncle saw that she 
was gloomy, he took the stained handkerchief and by 
retouching the inky spot changed it into a beautiful design of a 
flower. Now the handkerchief was more gorgeous than before. 
As he handed it back to Anna, she exclaimed with joy, “Oh! Is 
that my handkerchief?” “Yes, it is,” assured her uncle. “It is 
really yours. I have changed the stain into a beautiful rose.”
