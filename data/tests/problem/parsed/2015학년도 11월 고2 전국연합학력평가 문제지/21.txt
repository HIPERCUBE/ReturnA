Competition makes the world go round. It is the engine of 
evolution and the foundation of democracy. It prompts 
innovation, drives global markets, and puts money in the 
pocket. Still, there are those who have argued that competition 
is a source of evil. They see competition in terms of 
destructiveness: they don’t believe it’s a constructive activity. 
They assert that competition kills off more prosocial behaviors, 
such as cooperation and respect. The assumption that 
competition is the opposite of cooperation is missing something 
crucial. To compete, both opponents have to cooperate on the 
rules: there’s a mutual agreement of cooperation that governs 
the competition. As well, competitions are commonly among 
teams; each individual needs to cooperate with team members 
in order to compete effectively. Healthy competition can’t 
happen without cooperation. In fact, the hormones that drive us 
to compete are the same hormones that drive us to collaborate.
