33. Imagine tossing a coin over and over, and let’s say that the 
coin has landed heads up six times in a row. Many people 
believe that in this situation the coin is more likely to come up 
tails than heads on the next toss. But this conclusion is wrong, 
and this belief is commonly referred to as the “gambler’s 
fallacy.” The logic leading to this fallacy seems to be that if the 
coin is fair, then a series of tosses should contain equal 
numbers of heads and tails. If no tails have appeared for a 
while, then some are overdue to bring about this balance. But 
how could this be? The coin has no memory, so it has no way 
of knowing how long it has been since the last tails. More 
generally, there simply is no mechanism through which    
. Therefore, 
the likelihood of a tail on toss number 7 is 50-50, just as it was 
on the first toss, and just as it is on every toss. [3점]

④ repeated exposure could cause increased perceptions of confidence
⑤ the history of the previous tosses could influence the current one
