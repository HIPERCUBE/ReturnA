An experiment was conducted by Amos Tversky at 
Harvard Medical School in 1982. The physicians were asked 
to decide to recommend either surgery or radiation for their 
patients with lung cancer. Half of the physicians were told, 
“The one-month survival rate for surgery is 90%.” Given 
this information, 84% of the physicians chose to recommend 
surgery over radiation. The other physicians were provided 
with this information about surgery outcomes: “There is a 
10% mortality rate in the first month.” Given this latter 
information, only 50% of the physicians recommended 
surgery. As you may have realized, the two statements 
describe the same outcome. However, when the same 
outcome statistics are framed in terms of ‘survival,’ 
substantially more physicians choose the surgery. But when 
the outcomes are framed in terms of ‘mortality,’ the 
percentage of physicians who choose surgery drops greatly. 
This effect has been demonstrated in politics, medicine, 
advertising, and all areas in which people make decisions.

As an expert in the area of neuroeconomics, Baba Shiv 
carried out a fantastic experiment. He thought that ‘cognitive 
load’ (having lots to hold in your head ― a situation most 
professionals find themselves in) might influence 
self-control. He gave half his volunteers a two-digit 
number to remember (representing a low cognitive load) and 
gave the other half a seven-digit number (a high load). The 
volunteers were then told to walk to another room in the 
building and in so doing pass a table where they had to 
choose between chocolate cake (high fat and sugary food) or 
fruit salad (low fat and nutritious food). Of the people with 
the high load, 59 percent opted for cake whereas only 37 
percent of the people with the low load did. 
Shiv thinks that remembering seven numbers required 
cognitive resources that had to come from somewhere, and 
in this case were taken from our ability to control our urges! 
Anatomically this is reasonable because working memory 
(where we ‘store’ the seven or two numbers) and 
self-control are both located in the same part of our brain. 
The brain cells that would normally be helping us make  
　　　　      　      were otherwise engaged in remembering seven 
numbers. In those instances we have to rely on our more 
impulsive emotions, such as ‘Mmmm yummy! Chocolate cake 
please.’

Henry’s father was a house painter. In his lifetime, he must 
have painted hundreds of houses, inside and out. He was a 
happy, outgoing man who made friends easily. It wasn’t hard 
to tell that he loved his work as well as his life. He was also 
an excellent painter. No one could paint a wall like him, 
which is why (a) his services were always in demand.
