In business school they teach an approach to management 
decisions that is designed to overcome our natural tendency to 
cling to the familiar, whether or not it works. If an executive 
wants to examine a company policy, he or she first puts aside 
whatever has been done historically, and focuses instead on 
what the policy should be. Follow the same approach as you 
examine how you should look, speak and act to best achieve 
your objectives. Don’t assume that there is some inherent value 
to the way you have always done things. Keep focused on 
becoming the best you can be, not how you have always been.
