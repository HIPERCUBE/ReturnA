31. Today it often seems we remember very little. When I wake 
up, the first thing I do is check my day planner, which 
remembers my schedule so that I don’t have to. When I climb 
into my car, I enter my destination into the GPS, whose spatial 
memory supplants my own. When I sit down to work, I open up a 
notebook that holds the contents of my interviews. Now, thanks 
to the Internet, I rarely have to remember anything more than 
the right set of search terms to access humankind’s collective 
memory. Growing up, in the days when you still had to press 
seven buttons, or turn a clunky rotary dial, to make a telephone 
call, I could recall the numbers of all my close friends and family. 
Today, I’m not sure if I know more than four phone numbers by 
heart. And that’s probably more than most people do. Our gadgets  
the need to remember such things.
