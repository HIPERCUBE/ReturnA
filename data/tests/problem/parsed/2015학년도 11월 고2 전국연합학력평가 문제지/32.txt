32. When children are very young, you first say no to protect them 
from danger. You say it because you love your child and because 
you must teach him to protect himself. Just as saying no is a tool 
to help ensure your child’s physical safety, it also contributes to 
his emotional security. When you set limits on your child’s 
behavior, whether it’s telling a five-year-old he can’t hit the baby 
or telling a teenager he can’t stay out past midnight, you’re letting 
him know that his actions don’t happen in a vacuum. He is 
connected to someone(you) who watches and cares what he does. 
All children need a safe space in which to grow and develop. While 
it’s a child’s nature to test the limits of that space, by climbing 
higher, venturing farther, or asking for more of what he wants, it’s 
also comforting for him                                                            .
