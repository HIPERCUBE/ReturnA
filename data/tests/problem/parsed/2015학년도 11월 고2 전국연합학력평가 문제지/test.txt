Harold Allen, Manager
Smalltown Transit Authority 
Dear Mr. Allen:
On behalf of the Lakeview Senior Apartment Complex, I 
want to thank the Smalltown Transit Authority for adding 
a stop on Route 16 to serve the residents. Since you 
accepted our petition, the bus company will initiate the 
service to the front door of our complex every day 
between 10 A.M. and 3 P.M. heading into town, and from 
11 A.M. to 4 P.M. returning from Smalltown. We very 
much appreciate the chance to travel independently to town 
for shopping and entertainment, and plan to support the bus 
service as best we can.
Sincerely,
Ron Miller

19. 다음 글에 드러난 Anna의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Anna received a cute handkerchief as a gift for her tenth 
birthday. Accidentally an inkpot fell onto her beloved 
handkerchief causing a huge ugly spot. Anna was heartbroken 
when she saw the hideous stain. When her uncle saw that she 
was gloomy, he took the stained handkerchief and by 
retouching the inky spot changed it into a beautiful design of a 
flower. Now the handkerchief was more gorgeous than before. 
As he handed it back to Anna, she exclaimed with joy, “Oh! Is 
that my handkerchief?” “Yes, it is,” assured her uncle. “It is 
really yours. I have changed the stain into a beautiful rose.”

20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
In business school they teach an approach to management 
decisions that is designed to overcome our natural tendency to 
cling to the familiar, whether or not it works. If an executive 
wants to examine a company policy, he or she first puts aside 
whatever has been done historically, and focuses instead on 
what the policy should be. Follow the same approach as you 
examine how you should look, speak and act to best achieve 
your objectives. Don’t assume that there is some inherent value 
to the way you have always done things. Keep focused on 
becoming the best you can be, not how you have always been.
① 우선순위를 결정한 뒤 일을 시작하라.
② 신중하게 판단하고 신속하게 결정하라. 
③ 전문성 개발을 위해 끊임없이 공부하라.
④ 목표 달성을 위해 기존의 방식을 버려라.
⑤ 실패를 성장과 개선을 위한 기회로 이용하라.

Competition makes the world go round. It is the engine of 
evolution and the foundation of democracy. It prompts 
innovation, drives global markets, and puts money in the 
pocket. Still, there are those who have argued that competition 
is a source of evil. They see competition in terms of 
destructiveness: they don’t believe it’s a constructive activity. 
They assert that competition kills off more prosocial behaviors, 
such as cooperation and respect. The assumption that 
competition is the opposite of cooperation is missing something 
crucial. To compete, both opponents have to cooperate on the 
rules: there’s a mutual agreement of cooperation that governs 
the competition. As well, competitions are commonly among 
teams; each individual needs to cooperate with team members 
in order to compete effectively. Healthy competition can’t 
happen without cooperation. In fact, the hormones that drive us 
to compete are the same hormones that drive us to collaborate. 
① Competition: Another Form of Cooperation
② Are You Ready for a Collaborative Partner?
③ No Room for Mutual Respect in Competition
④ How to Balance Competition and Cooperation
⑤ Achieve Cooperation via Active Communication
22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
The concept of ‘degrowth’ asks: “do I really need this object, 
or am I buying it because I like the feeling of buying 
something?” It originated from the ideas of ecological 
economics and anti-consumerism. The key to the concept is 
that reducing your consumption will not reduce your wellbeing; 
rather, it will maximize your happiness by allowing you to have 
more time and savings to spend on things like art, music, family, 
and community. Today we consume 26 times more stuff than 
we did 60 years ago. But ask yourself: are we 26 times happier? 
Consider what Mahatma Gandhi said: “Not all our gold and 
jewelry could satisfy our hunger and quench our thirst.”
* quench: (갈증을) 해소시키다
① 행복을 위해서 현재에 집중해야 한다.
② 물질만능주의 사회에서는 절약이 중요하다.
③ 시대의 변화에 따라 행복의 의미는 다를 수 있다.
④ 불필요한 소비를 줄이면 행복감을 높일 수 있다.
⑤ 경제 활성화를 위해 소비자 중심 정책을 강화해야 한다.
23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
The extraordinary expansion of food production by 
aquafarming has come with high costs to the environment and 
human health. As with industrialized agriculture, most 
commercial aquafarming relies on high energy and chemical 
inputs, including antibiotics and artificial feeds made from the 
wastes of poultry processing. Such production practices tend to 
concentrate toxins in farmed fish, creating a potential health 
threat to consumers. The discharge from fish farms, which can 
be equivalent to the sewage from a small city, can pollute 
nearby natural aquatic ecosystems. Around the tropics, 
especially tropical Asia, the expansion of commercial shrimp 
farms is contributing to the loss of highly biodiverse coastal 
mangrove forests.
* sewage: 오물, 하수
① necessities of ocean-based economic activities
② discoveries of profitable species for aquafarming
③ alternatives to protect endangered marine species 
④ consequences of expanding commercial aquafarming 
⑤ difficulties in reducing the levels of marine pollutants

25. Elephant Butte Reservoir에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 
않는 것은? 
Elephant Butte Reservoir is the 84th largest man-made lake 
in the United States and the largest in New Mexico by total 
surface area. It is the only place in New Mexico where one can 
find pelicans resting alongside the lake. The reservoir is also 
part of the largest state park in New Mexico, Elephant Butte 
Lake State Park. Elephant Butte Reservoir derives its name 
from an island in the lake, a flat-topped, eroded volcanic core 
in the shape of an elephant. The reservoir is part of the Rio 
Grande Project, a project to provide power to south-central 
New Mexico and west Texas. There has been a decrease in the 
water level because of years of drought. However, fishing is 
still a popular recreational activity on the reservoir, which 
mainly contains different types of bass.

33. Imagine tossing a coin over and over, and let’s say that the 
coin has landed heads up six times in a row. Many people 
believe that in this situation the coin is more likely to come up 
tails than heads on the next toss. But this conclusion is wrong, 
and this belief is commonly referred to as the “gambler’s 
fallacy.” The logic leading to this fallacy seems to be that if the 
coin is fair, then a series of tosses should contain equal 
numbers of heads and tails. If no tails have appeared for a 
while, then some are overdue to bring about this balance. But 
how could this be? The coin has no memory, so it has no way 
of knowing how long it has been since the last tails. More 
generally, there simply is no mechanism through which    
. Therefore, 
the likelihood of a tail on toss number 7 is 50-50, just as it was 
on the first toss, and just as it is on every toss. [3점]
① a gambler with more physical power always wins the game
② a sensory memory decreases the chances of losing the game
③ a gambler’s next move has much to do with his emotional state
④ repeated exposure could cause increased perceptions of confidence
⑤ the history of the previous tosses could influence the current one

One of the underlying principles of investing is based upon 
the relationship between risk and return. The risk associated 
with an investment can be defined as the probability of earning 
an expected profit.      (A)      , if you deposit $1,000 into a 
savings account at your local bank, you would expect this to be 
a low-risk investment. Banks are generally conservative, and 
savings accounts are guaranteed by the federal government 
up to a certain dollar amount. If the bank promises to pay you 
a 2 percent annual interest rate, the chances are great that at 
the end of one year you will have $1,020.      (B)      , there 
is a high probability that you will earn a 2 percent annual profit, 
and this would be considered a low-risk investment.

“To name is to call into existence ― to call out of 
nothingness,” wrote French philosopher Georges Gusdorf. 
Words give you a tool to create how you perceive the world by 
naming and labeling what you experience. ① You undoubtedly 
learned in your elementary science class that Sir Isaac Newton 
discovered gravity. ② It would be more accurate to say that he 
labeled rather than discovered it. ③ Some scientific discoveries 
often led to terrible disasters in human history. ④ His use of 
the word gravity gave us a cognitive category; we now 
converse about the pull of the earth’s forces that keeps us from flying into space. ⑤ Words give us the symbolic vehicles to 
communicate our creations and discoveries to others.

Applying a single plan to everything can be inefficient and 
sometimes comical. Perhaps you remember the folktale about 
the lazy son who gets scolded by his mother for losing the 
money he received as payment from a farmer. 
(A) For example, writing out your notes in full sentences 
makes sense if the goal is to study a textbook. But if you 
used the same plan for taking lecture notes, you’d move so 
slowly that you’d miss most of what the instructor said. 
The secret is to find a plan that fits your goal.
(B) Anxious not to anger his mother, the boy dutifully pours 
the milk into his pocket. Although his mother’s plan was 
good, it could work only when used in the right 
circumstance. The same idea applies to your study plans. 
(C) “Next time you get paid,” his mother says sternly, “be sure 
to carry it home in your pocket.” But the following day the 
boy goes to work for a dairy farmer, who pays him with a 
pail of milk instead of money.

Composition is not just about framing the picture, it is also 
pressing the camera shutter at exactly the right moment. Get 
the timing wrong, and the picture may well lose some of its 
energy. 
(A) But with other, less predictable, events there can be 
magical moments ― when constantly changing conditions 
and people suddenly come together to create a strong, 
beautiful, energetic composition. Such moments might be 
when two or more elements combine in a certain way. 
(B) For some subjects, the key times at which to take pictures 
are obvious, such as the moment when a winner crosses 
the finishing line. On such occasions, preparation and 
practice count as much as good luck. 
(C) On a stormy day, for example, a beautiful building might 
suddenly be illuminated by a shaft of light, creating a 
moody scene that might never be recaptured. To make the 
most of these decisive moments requires patience and the 
vision to see what might happen, even before it presents 
itself in the viewfinder. [3점]

For example, your boss suddenly asks you for a key fact or 
number during a big, highly anticipated meeting．
When you are stressed out, you may not even realize all of the 
ways in which your mind and body are affected. ( ① ) However, 
you can easily recognize this connection between tension and 
memory, if you stop and think about a time when your memory 
failed because you were overly anxious. ( ② ) You freeze up and 
can’t remember it even though you knew it well the night before. 
( ③ ) But if a co-worker asks you the same question while 
passing in the hall, you easily recall the information and 
immediately provide the right answer. ( ④ ) Reducing stress and 
tension will help you improve your memory dramatically. ( ⑤ ) 
Just by maintaining a calm, focused attitude toward whatever 
you are doing, you will be able to reduce the negative effects of 
intense anxiety so you can perform at your best.

They were constructed that way to minimize property taxes, 
which were based on the width of a house. 
Throughout history, people have changed their behavior to 
avoid taxes. Centuries ago, the Duke of Tuscany imposed a tax 
on salt. ( ① ) Tuscan bakers responded by eliminating salt in 
their recipes and giving us the delicious Tuscan bread we enjoy 
today. ( ② ) If you visit Amsterdam, you will notice that almost 
all the old houses are narrow and tall. ( ③ ) Consider another 
architectural example, the invention of the mansard roof in 
France. ( ④ ) Property taxes were often imposed on the number 
of rooms in a house and, therefore, rooms on the second or third 
floor were considered just as ratable as those on the ground floor. 
( ⑤) But if a mansard roof was constructed on the third floor, 
those rooms were considered to be part of an attic and not taxed.

An experiment was conducted by Amos Tversky at 
Harvard Medical School in 1982. The physicians were asked 
to decide to recommend either surgery or radiation for their 
patients with lung cancer. Half of the physicians were told, 
“The one-month survival rate for surgery is 90%.” Given 
this information, 84% of the physicians chose to recommend 
surgery over radiation. The other physicians were provided 
with this information about surgery outcomes: “There is a 
10% mortality rate in the first month.” Given this latter 
information, only 50% of the physicians recommended 
surgery. As you may have realized, the two statements 
describe the same outcome. However, when the same 
outcome statistics are framed in terms of ‘survival,’ 
substantially more physicians choose the surgery. But when 
the outcomes are framed in terms of ‘mortality,’ the 
percentage of physicians who choose surgery drops greatly. 
This effect has been demonstrated in politics, medicine, 
advertising, and all areas in which people make decisions.

As an expert in the area of neuroeconomics, Baba Shiv 
carried out a fantastic experiment. He thought that ‘cognitive 
load’ (having lots to hold in your head ― a situation most 
professionals find themselves in) might influence 
self-control. He gave half his volunteers a two-digit 
number to remember (representing a low cognitive load) and 
gave the other half a seven-digit number (a high load). The 
volunteers were then told to walk to another room in the 
building and in so doing pass a table where they had to 
choose between chocolate cake (high fat and sugary food) or 
fruit salad (low fat and nutritious food). Of the people with 
the high load, 59 percent opted for cake whereas only 37 
percent of the people with the low load did. 
Shiv thinks that remembering seven numbers required 
cognitive resources that had to come from somewhere, and 
in this case were taken from our ability to control our urges! 
Anatomically this is reasonable because working memory 
(where we ‘store’ the seven or two numbers) and 
self-control are both located in the same part of our brain. 
The brain cells that would normally be helping us make  
　　　　      　      were otherwise engaged in remembering seven 
numbers. In those instances we have to rely on our more 
impulsive emotions, such as ‘Mmmm yummy! Chocolate cake 
please.’

(A)
Henry’s father was a house painter. In his lifetime, he must 
have painted hundreds of houses, inside and out. He was a 
happy, outgoing man who made friends easily. It wasn’t hard 
to tell that he loved his work as well as his life. He was also 
an excellent painter. No one could paint a wall like him, 
which is why (a) his services were always in demand. 
(B)
Finally, his father offered Henry some advice. “Don’t worry 
about spills and messes. They can always be cleaned up. 
Treat a wall the way you treat people ― be generous, have 
fun. Always put enough paint on the brush.” With that, (b) he 
turned and applied a thick coat of paint to the wall, resuming 
his conversation with the homeowner. His father did spill a 
few drops but made a better-looking wall while having fun.
(C)
Once, while in college, Henry went to help his father paint 
a house. Henry was working inside and noticed how skilled 
his father was at quickly applying a quality coat of paint to a 
wall. As a matter of fact, while carrying on a conversation 
with the homeowner, laughing the whole time, his father 
applied generous amounts of paint to the wall. (c) He painted 
three walls compared to Henry’s one. 
(D)
At one point, Henry’s father stopped working and watched 
him. (d) He noticed how Henry took his time dipping the 
brush in the paint bucket and how he carefully wiped off both 
sides of the brush as he pulled it out in order not to waste 
any paint. Henry then spread a thin coat of paint on the wall 
without spilling a drop. It was a slow, tedious process, but 
(e) he dared not laugh or “kid around” for fear of making a 
mess and embarrassing his father.
