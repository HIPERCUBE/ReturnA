Composition is not just about framing the picture, it is also 
pressing the camera shutter at exactly the right moment. Get 
the timing wrong, and the picture may well lose some of its 
energy. 
(A) But with other, less predictable, events there can be 
magical moments ― when constantly changing conditions 
and people suddenly come together to create a strong, 
beautiful, energetic composition. Such moments might be 
when two or more elements combine in a certain way. 
(B) For some subjects, the key times at which to take pictures 
are obvious, such as the moment when a winner crosses 
the finishing line. On such occasions, preparation and 
practice count as much as good luck. 
(C) On a stormy day, for example, a beautiful building might 
suddenly be illuminated by a shaft of light, creating a 
moody scene that might never be recaptured. To make the 
most of these decisive moments requires patience and the 
vision to see what might happen, even before it presents 
itself in the viewfinder. [3점]
