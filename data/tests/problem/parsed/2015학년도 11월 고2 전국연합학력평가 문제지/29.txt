Traditionally, most ecologists assumed that community 
stability ― the ability of a community to withstand 
environmental disturbances ― is a consequence of community 
(A) complexity / simplicity . That is, a community with considerable 
species richness may function better and be more stable than a 
community with less species richness. According to this view, the 
greater the species richness, the less critically important any single 
species should be. With many possible interactions within the 
community, it is (B) likely / unlikely that any single disturbance 
could affect enough components of the system to make a 
significant difference in its functioning. Evidence for this 
hypothesis includes the fact that destructive outbreaks of pests 
are more (C) common / uncommon in cultivated fields, which 
are low-diversity communities, than in natural communities 
with greater species richness.
