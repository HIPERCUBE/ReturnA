(A)
Henry’s father was a house painter. In his lifetime, he must 
have painted hundreds of houses, inside and out. He was a 
happy, outgoing man who made friends easily. It wasn’t hard 
to tell that he loved his work as well as his life. He was also 
an excellent painter. No one could paint a wall like him, 
which is why (a) his services were always in demand. 
(B)
Finally, his father offered Henry some advice. “Don’t worry 
about spills and messes. They can always be cleaned up. 
Treat a wall the way you treat people ― be generous, have 
fun. Always put enough paint on the brush.” With that, (b) he 
turned and applied a thick coat of paint to the wall, resuming 
his conversation with the homeowner. His father did spill a 
few drops but made a better-looking wall while having fun.
(C)
Once, while in college, Henry went to help his father paint 
a house. Henry was working inside and noticed how skilled 
his father was at quickly applying a quality coat of paint to a 
wall. As a matter of fact, while carrying on a conversation 
with the homeowner, laughing the whole time, his father 
applied generous amounts of paint to the wall. (c) He painted 
three walls compared to Henry’s one. 
(D)
At one point, Henry’s father stopped working and watched 
him. (d) He noticed how Henry took his time dipping the 
brush in the paint bucket and how he carefully wiped off both 
sides of the brush as he pulled it out in order not to waste 
any paint. Henry then spread a thin coat of paint on the wall 
without spilling a drop. It was a slow, tedious process, but 
(e) he dared not laugh or “kid around” for fear of making a 
mess and embarrassing his father.
