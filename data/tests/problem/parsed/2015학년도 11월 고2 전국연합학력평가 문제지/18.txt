Harold Allen, Manager
Smalltown Transit Authority 
Dear Mr. Allen:
On behalf of the Lakeview Senior Apartment Complex, I 
want to thank the Smalltown Transit Authority for adding 
a stop on Route 16 to serve the residents. Since you 
accepted our petition, the bus company will initiate the 
service to the front door of our complex every day 
between 10 A.M. and 3 P.M. heading into town, and from 
11 A.M. to 4 P.M. returning from Smalltown. We very 
much appreciate the chance to travel independently to town 
for shopping and entertainment, and plan to support the bus 
service as best we can.
Sincerely,
Ron Miller
