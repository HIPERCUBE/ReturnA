If we create a routine, we don’t have to expend precious 
energy every day prioritizing everything. We must simply expend 
a small amount of initial energy to create the routine, and then all 
that is left to do is follow it. There is a huge body of scientific 
research to explain the mechanism (A) which / by which routine 
enables difficult things to become easy. One simplified 
explanation is that as we repeatedly do a certain task the 
neurons, or nerve cells, (B) make / making new connections 
through communication gateways called ‘synapses.’ With 
repetition, the connections strengthen and it becomes easier for 
the brain to activate them. For example, when you learn a new 
word it takes several repetitions at various intervals for the 
word to be mastered. To recall the word later you will need to 
activate the same synapses until eventually you know the word 
without consciously thinking about (C) it / them .
