On a spring day in New York’s Central Park, a balloon 
salesman was busy trying to sell ① his balloons. In order to 
gain the attention of those walking in the park, from time to 
time ② he would release a brightly colored balloon and let it 
rise into the sky. In the sunny afternoon, a little 
African-American boy approached ③ him. The boy was shy 
and had a poor self-image. ④ He had been watching the man 
and had a question for him. “Mister, if you let a black balloon 
go, will it rise too?” The balloon salesman knew what he was 
asking. “Sweetheart,” ⑤ he explained. “It doesn’t matter what 
color the balloon is. It’s not what’s on the outside that makes it 
rise; it’s what’s on the inside that makes it go up.”
