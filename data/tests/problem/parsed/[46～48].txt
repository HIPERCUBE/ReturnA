(A)
Sometimes, someone saying you can’t do something is 
good for you. It builds mental toughness and conviction. 
I often tell people, “Anyone with young children will 
tell you, if you ask them not to do something, they’re 
guaranteed to do it.” The following story is an example 
of how my dad used this to (a) his (and ultimately my) 
advantage.
(B)
I was so annoyed and upset by (b) his response that I 
worked tirelessly for the remainder of the school year. In 
those critical few months I worked so hard that I ended 
up winning three awards at the end of year prize-giving. 
The best part was being able to tell my dad that I’d 
been awarded a place at college. On hearing this news, 
he simply lowered his newspaper and, with a smile, said, 
“Well done, I always knew you would.” At that moment, 
I realized what (c) he had done by ‘discouraging’ me.
(C)
This was my first experience of ‘reverse psychology.’ 
Some people might say it’s a risky strategy, but it has 
certainly worked for me. It has been extremely valuable in 
my life, giving me the confidence, determination and 
motivation to succeed, even when the odds are stacked 
against me. Now as a father myself, I sometimes use the 
same technique to motivate my own son. Often enough, 
he ends up with favorable results. I just hope one day 
(d) he also realizes that I had his best interests in mind.
(D)
As a child I wasn’t particularly academic or ambitious, 
and certainly didn’t work very hard at my studies. It 
wasn’t until I was coming to the end of the eleventh 
grade―and facing the prospect of leaving school without 
any sense of what I wanted to do as a career―that I 
decided to apply to the local college to pursue further 
study. Feeling pleased with myself for having made this 
monumental decision, I proudly announced my plan to 
my dad. (e) His immediate reaction was to say, “You’ll 
never do that. They’ll never accept you.”
