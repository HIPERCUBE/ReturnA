While most of us assume that “use-by date” is
synonymous with “expiration date,” those numbers have
nothing to do with food safety and actually aren’t under any
federal regulation at all. “Use-by” dates are set by the
manufacturers and only indicate by what date the product
should be used for “peak quality.” Once a product has
passed its “use-by” date, most consumers will throw it
out, incorrectly concluding that the product is expired and
therefore no longer good to use. And what do we do
when we’ve run out of a product? Buy more, of course.
Unfortunately, misunderstanding over these “use-by”
dates leads to a lot of food waste. A research shows that
almost 50 percent of consumers don’t understand “use-by”
dates on food labels and that up to 20 percent of food
waste is linked to this misunderstanding. Currently infant
formula is the only product whose “use-by” date is
regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture.
As it doesn’t look like regulation of these dates will receive
attention anytime soon, it’s up to you to be a smart shopper.
Use your common sense (and new-found knowledge) to
determine whether or not a food product is .
Sometimes, a good sniff is all you need.
