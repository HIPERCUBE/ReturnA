For five hundred years beginning in the eighth century
A.D., the Moors ruled large portions of southern Europe
including Spain. The Spanish, originally a people of milky
skin color, intermarried with the dark-skinned Moors,
producing the darker-skinned Spanish people of today.
(A) , certain members of the Spanish aristocracy
did not associate with the Moors but were allowed to live
undisturbed in the mountains of Castile. Here, these old
families deliberately avoided the sun to preserve their light
skin color and thus set themselves apart from the foreign
invaders. (B) , their skin became very pale and, in
the case of the older people, very translucent. This allowed
blood vessels to show through the skin in vivid blue, which
led to these pure, upper-class Castilians being referred to
as “bluebloods.”
