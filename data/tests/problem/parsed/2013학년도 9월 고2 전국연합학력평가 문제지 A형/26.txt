Like many of our other units of measure, inches, feet, and
yards resulted from man’s early tendency to measure things
with parts of his body. The inch came from the approximate
width of a man’s thumb, which was used to measure small
distances. The foot is, of course, based upon the length of a
man’s foot, which he used to step off longer distances. The
yard is about the distance between the tip of a man’s nose
and the fingers of his outstretched arm, a distance that
became a standard for measuring lengths of cloth. Other
units of measure based on human dimensions are the cubit,
the distance from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger,
and the digit, the width of a finger.
