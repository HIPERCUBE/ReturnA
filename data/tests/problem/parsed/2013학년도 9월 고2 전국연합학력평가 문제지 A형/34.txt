34. A new study suggests that influence our
experience of the food. People perceived yogurt as denser
and more expensive when eaten with lighter spoons, the
researchers report today in the journal Flavour, probably
because those spoons matched their expectations. But yogurt
tasted with that spoon was also rated as less sweet than
when eaten with heavier or larger spoons. And the people
thought yogurt tasted sweeter when they ate it with a white
spoon than with a black one. In a final experiment with
different types of cheese, the researchers found that people
rated cheese as saltier when they sampled it with a knife
insead of a fork, spoon, or toothpick. This may have been
because eating with a knife is an unusual behavior, the
researchers speculated, or because it reminded people of
using a knife to try samples in a cheese shop, where
cheeses tend to be more aged and therefore saltier. [3점]
