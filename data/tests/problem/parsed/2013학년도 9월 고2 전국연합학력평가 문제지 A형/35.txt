35. “Once in a blue moon” is an appropriate way to describe
. A blue moon can occur when
large quantities of dust or other fine debris travel high
enough into the atmosphere to filter the moon’s reflected
light. One such blue moon occurred in 1883 when a volcanic
eruption on the island of Krakatoa emitted volcanic dust thirty
miles into the air. This dust, which spread three thousand
miles, filtered the moon’s light, making it appear pale blue.
As recently as 1950, another blue moon occurred when a
forest fire along the Alaskan highway in northern Canada sent
smoke, dust, and sulfur high into the atmosphere. For many
days the people of Great Britain witnessed a blue moon.
Thus, events that can occur, but only under the most
uncommon circumstances, are well described by the phrase
“once in a blue moon.” [3점]
