In 1954 the British government held an auction for
commercial television regions. Many companies were
interested in bidding for the franchises.
(A) Sydney Bernstein, a managing director of Granada
Cinemas, also wanted to compete in the auction, but with
a different perspective. He told his people, “Don’t look
for the richest region; look for the wettest. Find me the
region with highest rainfall.”
(B) They performed the population analysis of the locations
of the franchises to identify which were the wealthiest
regions that would produce the most advertising
revenues. The result was that they focused on London
and the South-East of England, the richest regions in
England.
(C) This turned out to be the North-West of England.
Granada bid for this and won it. Bernstein’s idea was
that it was better to have a region where it rained so
much that people stayed in and watched TV. He
succeeded by approaching the problem from a different
point of view.
