The pupil of your eye is the little black spot in the center
of the colored circle. The pupil is the window of your eye,
the only place where light can get in. ①The colored circle
around it is called the iris. ② It is a little circular sheet of
muscle that can make the pupil larger or smaller. ③The
reason that you blink is to prevent foreign bodies from
coming into your eye and causing you pain. ④ The iris
muscle is controlled by nerves that connect to give a neat
reflex action, the kind of nerve control you never think
about. ⑤That way, the iris works automatically to regulate
the size of the pupil and the amount of light that it lets into
your eyes.
