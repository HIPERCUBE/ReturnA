The graph above shows the average number of vacation
days the workers received and the days they actually used
in five countries last year. ① U.S. workers received the
least granted vacation days among the five countries, an
average of 12 days, of which they used only 10. ② On
average, U.K. workers received seven more vacation days
than Canadian workers. ③ Also, the average number of
granted vacation days of U.K. workers was more than twice
that of U.S. workers. ④While the Japanese workers were
granted 15 days off, they actually used less than half of
them. ⑤The average vacation days French workers received
were more than the combined days Canadian and Japanese
workers received.
