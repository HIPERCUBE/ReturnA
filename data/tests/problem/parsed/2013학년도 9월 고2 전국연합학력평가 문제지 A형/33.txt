It’s 5:30 a.m. on the opening day of hunting season and my
alarm explodes into a racket that would wake an army. I roll
out of bed and rub the sleep from my eyes. I only slept six
hours last night because my family and I were preparing for
the hunt, getting the guns ready, laying out hunting clothes,
everything. As I throw some pants on, the smell of fresh
pancakes wakes me up. Now I realize the season that makes
me feel happy finally has come. Since January, I have been
waiting for this day to come. Today begins the annual nine
day season that brings our family together each November.
