(A)
When you watch a baseball game, you can quickly tell
by the umpire’s gestures if the pitch was a ball or a
strike. What would baseball be without hand signals for
verbally called “ball” or “strike”? William Hoy, one of the
deaf major league baseball players, has been widely
credited with creating the hand signals that are still used
in baseball today.

(B)
Thanks to the umpire’s signals, the coach’s call signals,
and such supportive gestures from the crowds, Hoy went on
to play for several different major league teams as an
outfielder for fifteen years. It is amazing to see a deaf
person bring so much history into baseball. Hoy ended his
major league career in 1902 and he died in 1961 at the age
of 99. Sadly, (a) he has never been put in the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown. But he was one of the great
pioneers of baseball.
(C)
Soon, the coach was also signaling the opposing team’s
balls and strikes to Hoy when (b) he played outfield.
Gradually, hand signals became common use in baseball
among the players, coaches, and umpires. He even
inspired a sort of sign language in the crowds. With Hoy
being such a loved player, the crowds would jump up and
wave their arms to cheer for (c) him when he made a
great play.
(D)
Hoy was born in Ohio, on May 23, 1862. Due to an
illness in his childhood, he lost his hearing. He graduated
from the Ohio School for the Deaf and started his
professional career in 1886 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. When
(d) he started his baseball career, the umpire shouted all
the calls. When Hoy was up to bat, he asked his
third-base coach to raise his right arm to indicate a
strike and (e) his left arm to indicate a ball.
