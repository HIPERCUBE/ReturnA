23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Leaders and managers used to be told to keep a stiff
upper lip and not show emotion, to remove emotion from the
situation at hand and just deal with the facts. Despite all
your efforts to mask emotions, they will come out in some
form and people have an innate ability to pick up on this.
Emotions are always at play, so we need to reframe the
role that emotions play in the workplace. We need to view
emotions as the fuel that drives the engine of productivity
and innovation. The reality is that you will never separate
emotions from your workplace. Individuals who are good at
dealing with the tough stuff are those who have learned, and
even mastered, the art of managing emotions. So, instead of
spending time in trying to push aside or suppress emotions,
it is far better to learn how to manage them well.
① 감정 표출은 정신 건강에 이롭다.

25. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Have you ever noticed that some people can effortlessly
learn new concepts and materials while others struggle?
Some were born with extraordinarily high IQs, but certainly
not all. Fortunately, there is one technique that will help
you to learn faster, study better, and begin absorbing
information like a sponge. If there’s something you want to
learn, try teaching it to someone else. Traditional studying
helps you to memorize ideas, but teaching those ideas to
someone else forces you to truly “get” all of the concepts
and apply them to a number of solutions. To teach others
you must anticipate any potential questions and explore the
topic from all angles, dramatically increasing your own
understanding.

26. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Like many of our other units of measure, inches, feet, and
yards resulted from man’s early tendency to measure things
with parts of his body. The inch came from the approximate
width of a man’s thumb, which was used to measure small
distances. The foot is, of course, based upon the length of a
man’s foot, which he used to step off longer distances. The
yard is about the distance between the tip of a man’s nose
and the fingers of his outstretched arm, a distance that
became a standard for measuring lengths of cloth. Other
units of measure based on human dimensions are the cubit,
the distance from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger,
and the digit, the width of a finger.

적절한 것은? [3점]
It is easier for right-handed people to push buttons on
the right through holes on the left. This is why men’s
clothes (A) have / having buttons on the right since most
people are right-handed. But what about women, who are
also mostly right-handed? When buttons first came to be
used, they were very expensive and were worn primarily
by the rich. Women in that class did not usually dress
(B) them / themselves but were dressed by maids. Since
a maid would be facing a woman she was dressing,
dressmakers put the buttons on the maid’s right, and this,
of course, put them on the woman’s left (C) which / where

않은 것은? [3점]
Openness is important no matter what your business or
venture. The Charity Water website ① includes a Google
Map location and photographs of every well. When you look
at the site, you can see what Charity Water is doing. Many
people are ② hesitant to give to nonprofits, because they
don’t know where or how their money is actually going to
be used. This is why it can be a good idea to get
individuals or an organization to underwrite your operational
costs. This way, all the donations you collect go straight
to the people you are working to help ― making your
donors feel ③ uncertain their dollars are doing good things
― and that only creates more generosity on their part. Being
open also ④ encourages you to be responsible with the
money you take in. If people are aware of where their
money goes, you’ll be ⑤ less likely to spend it on a fancy
office or high salaries.

It’s 5:30 a.m. on the opening day of hunting season and my
alarm explodes into a racket that would wake an army. I roll
out of bed and rub the sleep from my eyes. I only slept six
hours last night because my family and I were preparing for
the hunt, getting the guns ready, laying out hunting clothes,
everything. As I throw some pants on, the smell of fresh
pancakes wakes me up. Now I realize the season that makes
me feel happy finally has come. Since January, I have been
waiting for this day to come. Today begins the annual nine
day season that brings our family together each November.

34. A new study suggests that influence our
experience of the food. People perceived yogurt as denser
and more expensive when eaten with lighter spoons, the
researchers report today in the journal Flavour, probably
because those spoons matched their expectations. But yogurt
tasted with that spoon was also rated as less sweet than
when eaten with heavier or larger spoons. And the people
thought yogurt tasted sweeter when they ate it with a white
spoon than with a black one. In a final experiment with
different types of cheese, the researchers found that people
rated cheese as saltier when they sampled it with a knife
insead of a fork, spoon, or toothpick. This may have been
because eating with a knife is an unusual behavior, the
researchers speculated, or because it reminded people of
using a knife to try samples in a cheese shop, where
cheeses tend to be more aged and therefore saltier. [3점]
① ages ② places ③ genders
④ utensils ⑤ ingredients
35. “Once in a blue moon” is an appropriate way to describe
. A blue moon can occur when
large quantities of dust or other fine debris travel high
enough into the atmosphere to filter the moon’s reflected
light. One such blue moon occurred in 1883 when a volcanic
eruption on the island of Krakatoa emitted volcanic dust thirty
miles into the air. This dust, which spread three thousand
miles, filtered the moon’s light, making it appear pale blue.
As recently as 1950, another blue moon occurred when a
forest fire along the Alaskan highway in northern Canada sent
smoke, dust, and sulfur high into the atmosphere. For many
days the people of Great Britain witnessed a blue moon.
Thus, events that can occur, but only under the most
uncommon circumstances, are well described by the phrase
“once in a blue moon.” [3점]

① very difficult situations
② completely fictional objects
③ rare but actual occurrences
④ disasters caused by humans
⑤ steadily occurring phenomena
36. With old friends, you can argue about politics, tell
informal jokes, and reveal sensitive personal facts. With new
coworkers, though, you probably avoid discussions of politics,
tell only the cleanest jokes, and avoid lots of highly personal
topics. Over time, you may overhear jokes told by colleagues
and get a sense of what type of humor is appropriate in your
workplace. Chances are, though, that when you tell jokes of
your own to the group, you will keep your topics well within
the borders defined by the jokes you have heard told by
your colleagues. That is, the first jokes you hear told by
your colleagues help . When
you tell a joke of your own, you are testing that belief. The
safest way to test that belief is to stick within the range of
what you already believe to be acceptable. [3점]
① to shape your political belief
② to strengthen a belief through discussion
③ to maintain relationships with old friends
④ to release tension you may not be aware of
⑤ to form a belief about what is appropriate

For five hundred years beginning in the eighth century
A.D., the Moors ruled large portions of southern Europe
including Spain. The Spanish, originally a people of milky
skin color, intermarried with the dark-skinned Moors,
producing the darker-skinned Spanish people of today.
(A) , certain members of the Spanish aristocracy
did not associate with the Moors but were allowed to live
undisturbed in the mountains of Castile. Here, these old
families deliberately avoided the sun to preserve their light
skin color and thus set themselves apart from the foreign
invaders. (B) , their skin became very pale and, in
the case of the older people, very translucent. This allowed
blood vessels to show through the skin in vivid blue, which
led to these pure, upper-class Castilians being referred to
as “bluebloods.”

38. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
The pupil of your eye is the little black spot in the center
of the colored circle. The pupil is the window of your eye,
the only place where light can get in. ①The colored circle
around it is called the iris. ② It is a little circular sheet of
muscle that can make the pupil larger or smaller. ③The
reason that you blink is to prevent foreign bodies from
coming into your eye and causing you pain. ④ The iris
muscle is controlled by nerves that connect to give a neat
reflex action, the kind of nerve control you never think
about. ⑤That way, the iris works automatically to regulate
the size of the pupil and the amount of light that it lets into
your eyes.

Researchers at the University of Maryland have developed
a solution to this problem by using a paper-thin layer of
wood fibers.
As we look toward a future of more renewable energy
dependency, having reliable energy storage to back up wind and
solar will be necessary for everything to run smoothly. ( ① )
Lithium-ion batteries are great for gadgets and even cars, but
on a larger scale they’re too expensive and aren’t very
environmentally friendly. ( ② ) Many researchers believe
sodium-ion batteries are the answer because sodium is cheap
and eco-friendly, but the major obstacle to advancing these
batteries has been a very short life. ( ③ ) The wood is able
to withstand the swelling and contracting of the anode and
allows the battery to survive more than 400 charge cycles. ( ④ )
At the end of the charging cycles, the wood is wrinkled, but still
intact. ( ⑤ ) Computer models show that those wrinkles relax
the stress in the battery during charging and recharging, creating
a flexible and long-lasting battery.

In 1954 the British government held an auction for
commercial television regions. Many companies were
interested in bidding for the franchises.
(A) Sydney Bernstein, a managing director of Granada
Cinemas, also wanted to compete in the auction, but with
a different perspective. He told his people, “Don’t look
for the richest region; look for the wettest. Find me the
region with highest rainfall.”
(B) They performed the population analysis of the locations
of the franchises to identify which were the wealthiest
regions that would produce the most advertising
revenues. The result was that they focused on London
and the South-East of England, the richest regions in
England.
(C) This turned out to be the North-West of England.
Granada bid for this and won it. Bernstein’s idea was
that it was better to have a region where it rained so
much that people stayed in and watched TV. He
succeeded by approaching the problem from a different
point of view.

While most of us assume that “use-by date” is
synonymous with “expiration date,” those numbers have
nothing to do with food safety and actually aren’t under any
federal regulation at all. “Use-by” dates are set by the
manufacturers and only indicate by what date the product
should be used for “peak quality.” Once a product has
passed its “use-by” date, most consumers will throw it
out, incorrectly concluding that the product is expired and
therefore no longer good to use. And what do we do
when we’ve run out of a product? Buy more, of course.
Unfortunately, misunderstanding over these “use-by”
dates leads to a lot of food waste. A research shows that
almost 50 percent of consumers don’t understand “use-by”
dates on food labels and that up to 20 percent of food
waste is linked to this misunderstanding. Currently infant
formula is the only product whose “use-by” date is
regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture.
As it doesn’t look like regulation of these dates will receive
attention anytime soon, it’s up to you to be a smart shopper.
Use your common sense (and new-found knowledge) to
determine whether or not a food product is .
Sometimes, a good sniff is all you need.

(A)
When you watch a baseball game, you can quickly tell
by the umpire’s gestures if the pitch was a ball or a
strike. What would baseball be without hand signals for
verbally called “ball” or “strike”? William Hoy, one of the
deaf major league baseball players, has been widely
credited with creating the hand signals that are still used
in baseball today.
*umpire: (야구경기의)심판
(B)
Thanks to the umpire’s signals, the coach’s call signals,
and such supportive gestures from the crowds, Hoy went on
to play for several different major league teams as an
outfielder for fifteen years. It is amazing to see a deaf
person bring so much history into baseball. Hoy ended his
major league career in 1902 and he died in 1961 at the age
of 99. Sadly, (a) he has never been put in the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown. But he was one of the great
pioneers of baseball.
(C)
Soon, the coach was also signaling the opposing team’s
balls and strikes to Hoy when (b) he played outfield.
Gradually, hand signals became common use in baseball
among the players, coaches, and umpires. He even
inspired a sort of sign language in the crowds. With Hoy
being such a loved player, the crowds would jump up and
wave their arms to cheer for (c) him when he made a
great play.
(D)
Hoy was born in Ohio, on May 23, 1862. Due to an
illness in his childhood, he lost his hearing. He graduated
from the Ohio School for the Deaf and started his
professional career in 1886 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. When
(d) he started his baseball career, the umpire shouted all
the calls. When Hoy was up to bat, he asked his
third-base coach to raise his right arm to indicate a
strike and (e) his left arm to indicate a ball.
