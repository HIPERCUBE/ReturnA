20. Popular prejudice offers a black­and­white picture of the 
brain versus body paradigm. We are often told that exercise 
develops the body while reading, writing, and thinking are 
meant to develop the brain. This is a flawed perception. 
While mental activities such as reading, writing, solving 
mathematical problems, doing crosswords or participating in 
seminars are primarily concerned with the brain, they are 
also relevant to the body and have an impact on it. The 
emotions and sensory reactions created by these activities 
have an influence, however subtle, through chemical signals, 
on the body and its health.
