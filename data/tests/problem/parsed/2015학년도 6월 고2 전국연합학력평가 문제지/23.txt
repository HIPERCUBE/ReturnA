importance and can be the primary source of the norms with 
which they strive to conform. Peer pressure among them can 
affect how they drive a vehicle. Young drivers experience 
higher peer pressure than older drivers to commit traffic 
violations such as speeding, driving under the influence of 
alcohol and dangerous overtaking. Direct peer pressure may

female, drive faster and with a shorter following distance at 
road junctions if they have young passengers in the car.
