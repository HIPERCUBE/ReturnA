32. An illustration of the dangers of unrealistic optimism 
comes from a study of weight loss. In that study, 
psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that the obese women 
who were confident that they would succeed lost 26 pounds 
more than self­doubters, as expected. Meanwhile, Oettingen 
also asked the women to tell her what they imagined their 
roads to success would be like. The results were surprising: 
women who believed they would succeed easily lost 24 
pounds less than those who thought their weight­loss 
journeys would be hard. Believing that the road to success 
will be rocky leads to greater success, because it forces us 
to put in more effort and persist longer in the face of 
difficulty. It is necessary to cultivate our realistic optimism 
by combining a positive attitude with                       .
