21. Drinking water can contribute to good health, and schools 
are in a unique position to promote healthy dietary 
behaviors, including drinking sufficient water. More than 95% 
of children and adolescents are enrolled in schools, and 
students typically spend at least 6 hours at school each day. 
Ensuring that students have access to safe, free drinking 
water throughout the school environment gives them a 
healthy substitute for sugar­sweetened beverages. Access to 
clean and free water helps to increase students’ overall 
water consumption, maintain hydration, and reduce unhealthy 
calories intake. Adequate hydration may improve cognitive 
function among children and adolescents, which is important 
for learning.
