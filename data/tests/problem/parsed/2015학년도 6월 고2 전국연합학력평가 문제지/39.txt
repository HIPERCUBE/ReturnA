Keith Chen, a professor at Yale, had a question about 
what would happen if he could teach a group of monkeys 
to use money. Chen went to work with seven male 
monkeys at a lab.
(A) Once they learned how to use the coins, it turned out 
that individual monkeys had strong preferences for 
different treats. The monkey would exchange his coins 
for whichever food he preferred.
(B) So Chen gave the monkey a coin and then showed a 
treat. Whenever the monkey gave the coin back to 
Chen, he got the treat. It took months, but the 
monkeys eventually learned that the coins could buy the 
treats.
(C) When Chen gave a monkey a coin, he sniffed it and, 
after determining he couldn’t eat it, he tossed it aside. 
When Chen repeated this, the monkey started tossing 
the coin at him.
