Historical evidence points to workers being exploited by 
employers in the ① absence of appropriate laws. This 
means that workers are not always compensated for their 
② contributions, for their increased productivity, as 
economic theory would suggest. Employers will be able to 
exploit workers if they are not legally ③ controlled. Thus, 
the minimum wage laws may be the only way to prevent 
many employees from working at wages that are ④ above 
the poverty line. This point of view means that minimum 
wage laws are a source of correcting for existing market 
failure, ⑤ enhancing the power of markets to create 
efficient results.
