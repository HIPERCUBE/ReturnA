Black ice refers to a thin coating of glazed ice on a 
surface. While not truly black, it is virtually transparent, 
allowing black asphalt roadways or the surface below to be 
seen through it—hence the term “black ice”. ① Black ice is 
often practically invisible to drivers or persons stepping on 
it. ② There is, thus, a risk of sudden sliding and subsequent 
accidents. ③ To ensure safe driving, it is best to examine 
your car before starting. ④ On December 1, 2013, heavy 
post­Thanksgiving weekend traffic encountered black ice on 
the westbound I-290 expressway in Worcester, 
Massachusetts. ⑤ A chain reaction series of crashes 
resulted, involving three tractor­trailers and over 60 other 
vehicles.
