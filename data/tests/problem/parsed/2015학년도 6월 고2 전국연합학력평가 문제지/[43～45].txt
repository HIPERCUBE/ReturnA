(A)
On Christmas Eve in 2002, the W­Mart in Cleburne, 
Texas, was jammed and hectic. Dozens of people were 
waiting in long lines at checkout counters to purchase 
presents that would be next­morning treasures under 
someone’s tree. Emily was standing in cashier Melissa’s 
line. Emily lived on government support. Her clothes 
were worn; (a) her hands were those of a person who’d 
worked hard for what she had. 
(B)
And then an amazing thing happened. At the back of 
the line, a woman took out (b) her handbag, pulled out 
$100 and passed it forward. As the cash moved up the 
line, a twenty­dollar bill was added here, a ten­dollar bill 
there. Someone threw in a bunch of dollars. When the 
collection finally reached the register, Melissa counted 
$220. Strangers had fulfilled a poor woman’s Christmas 
wish to give her son his dream gift. The people in 
Melissa’s line in the Cleburne, Texas, W­Mart on that 
Christmas Eve had become one.
(C)
She held a single item in her arms as she patiently 
waited to move to the front of the line. Her son would 
get the one present he had asked for: a video game 
player. (c) She had saved all year for this; with tax, 
the total would be close to $220. As Melissa scanned 
the game player’s bar code into her register, the 
woman panicked. Where was her money? It wasn’t 
where (d) she remembered putting it earlier in the day. 
Her fear became obvious to the customers in line 
behind her as she started to cry.
(D)
‘Why my line?’ Melissa thought as she watched the 
frantic woman search through (e) her clothes. She was 
going to have to call her manager to cancel the sale and 
return the game player to a locked shelf. She’d have to 
shut down her checkout line and wait for the manager to 
come from another part of the crowded store. This was 
not something that any store manager or cashier wants 
on Christmas Eve.
