22. People are strongly influenced by irrelevant factors―the 
ones that speak to our unconscious desires and motivations. 
For example, in a study, subjects were given three different 
boxes of detergent and asked to try them all out, then 
report on which they liked best and why. One box was 
yellow, another blue, and the third was blue with splashes of 
yellow. The subjects overwhelmingly favored the detergent 
in the box with mixed colors. Their comments included much 
about the relative merits of the detergents, but none 
mentioned the box. Why should they? A pretty box doesn’t 
make the detergent work better. But in reality, it was just 
the box that differed―the detergents inside were all 
identical.
