36. 
That’s because she didn’t control for any other factors 
that could be related to both vitamin C and colds.
When researchers find that two variables are related, they 
often automatically leap to the conclusion that those two 
variables have a cause­and­effect relationship. ( ① ) For 
example, suppose a researcher found that people who took 
vitamin C every day reported having fewer colds than people 
who didn’t. ( ② ) Upon finding these results, she wrote a 
paper saying vitamin C prevents colds, using this data as 
evidence. ( ③ ) Now, while it may be true that vitamin C 
does prevent colds, this researcher’s study can’t claim that. 
( ④ ) For example, people who take vitamin C every day 
may be more health­conscious overall, washing their hands 
more often and exercising more. ( ⑤ ) Until you do a 
controlled experiment, you can’t make a cause­and­effect 
conclusion based on relationships you find. [3점]
