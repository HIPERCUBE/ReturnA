The process of job advancement in the field of sports ① is 
often said to be shaped like a pyramid. That is, at the wide 
base are many jobs with high school athletic teams, while at 
the narrow tip are the few, highly desired jobs with 
professional organizations. Thus there are many sports jobs 
altogether, but the competition becomes ② increasingly tough 
as one works their way up. The salaries of various positions 
reflect this pyramid model. For example, high school football 
coaches are typically teachers who ③ paid a little extra for 
their afterclass work. But coaches of the same sport at big 
universities can earn more than $1 million a year, causing 
the salaries of college presidents ④ to look small in 
comparison. One degree higher up is the National Football 
League, ⑤ where head coaches can earn many times more 
than their best­paid campus counterparts.
