Imagine you are climbing a rock wall in the mountains. 
You are halfway up the wall, hundreds of feet above the 
valley floor. You have just come to a small ledge. You know 
you would be vulnerable if the wind picked up, but on that 
ledge you have at least some sense of security. The 
problem is that to keep moving up, you have to abandon the 
security and reach for another hold. Letting go of that sense 
of security is the challenge, whether you are rock climbing 
or taking a new path in life. You have to release your hold 
on the old and grab on to the new.
* ledge: 절벽에서 선반처럼 튀어나온 바위

19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘Jessie’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
“I can’t believe we made – how much did we make?” cried 
Megan once they got back to her house. “One hundred and 
four dollars each. Each!” shouted Jessie. She couldn’t stop 
hopping from one foot to the other. “I’ve never seen so 
much money in my life!” Jessie was already running 
numbers in her head. Subtracting the eighty dollars that she 
and Megan had spent on lemonade and cups, each girl had 
made a profit of sixty­four dollars. If they doubled the 
number of their franchises from thirteen to twenty­six, they 
could each make one hundred and twenty­eight dollars in one 
day! Jessie pulled out a piece of paper and scribbled down a 
graph. The sky was the limit.
① excited ② nervous ③ jealous
④ disappointed ⑤ curious
[20～21] 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
20. Popular prejudice offers a black­and­white picture of the 
brain versus body paradigm. We are often told that exercise 
develops the body while reading, writing, and thinking are 
meant to develop the brain. This is a flawed perception. 
While mental activities such as reading, writing, solving 
mathematical problems, doing crosswords or participating in 
seminars are primarily concerned with the brain, they are 
also relevant to the body and have an impact on it. The 
emotions and sensory reactions created by these activities 
have an influence, however subtle, through chemical signals, 
on the body and its health.
① steps to improve academic skills
② how to develop brain function efficiently
③ benefits of enhancing physical conditions
④ the effect of mental activities on the body
⑤ the correlation between exercise and body
21. Drinking water can contribute to good health, and schools 
are in a unique position to promote healthy dietary 
behaviors, including drinking sufficient water. More than 95% 
of children and adolescents are enrolled in schools, and 
students typically spend at least 6 hours at school each day. 
Ensuring that students have access to safe, free drinking 
water throughout the school environment gives them a 
healthy substitute for sugar­sweetened beverages. Access to 
clean and free water helps to increase students’ overall 
water consumption, maintain hydration, and reduce unhealthy 
calories intake. Adequate hydration may improve cognitive 
function among children and adolescents, which is important 
for learning. 
①　importance of a well­balanced diet
②　difficulty of securing clean water sources
③ harm of sugar­sweetened beverages for children
④ necessity of providing drinkable water at school
⑤ warnings against excessive water use in public areas

22. People are strongly influenced by irrelevant factors―the 
ones that speak to our unconscious desires and motivations. 
For example, in a study, subjects were given three different 
boxes of detergent and asked to try them all out, then 
report on which they liked best and why. One box was 
yellow, another blue, and the third was blue with splashes of 
yellow. The subjects overwhelmingly favored the detergent 
in the box with mixed colors. Their comments included much 
about the relative merits of the detergents, but none 
mentioned the box. Why should they? A pretty box doesn’t 
make the detergent work better. But in reality, it was just 
the box that differed―the detergents inside were all 
identical. 
① Detergents: Newer Is Better
② Why Can’t Stop Impulse Buying?
③ Requirements for Quality Detergents
④ Unconsciousness: Secrets to Creativity
⑤ A Hidden Controller in Decision­Making
23. For many young people, peers are of significant 
importance and can be the primary source of the norms with 
which they strive to conform. Peer pressure among them can 
affect how they drive a vehicle. Young drivers experience 
higher peer pressure than older drivers to commit traffic 
violations such as speeding, driving under the influence of 
alcohol and dangerous overtaking. Direct peer pressure may 
be exerted on a young driver’s behavior through the 
influence of a passenger. Young drivers, both male and 
female, drive faster and with a shorter following distance at 
road junctions if they have young passengers in the car. 
① A Friend in Need Is a Friend Indeed!
② What Makes Young People Drive Carelessly?
③ Traffic Violations: A Sign of Self­Destruction
④ Differences Between Male and Female Drivers
⑤ How to Protect the Young from Peer Pressure
24. turkey vulture에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The turkey vulture is the most widespread vulture in the 
Americas. It ranges from southern Canada to the 
southernmost tip of South America, inhabiting subtropical 
forests, pastures, and deserts. The turkey vulture feeds 
almost exclusively on dead animals. It finds its food using 
its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to 
detect the gases produced by decaying animal bodies. It 
nests in caves and hollow trees. Each year, it generally 
raises two chicks. It has very few natural predators, and has 
legal protection in the United States under the Migratory 
Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

American E­book Readers 
by Age Group in 2012 and 2013
The graph above shows the percentage of American people 
by age group who read at least one e­book in 2012 and 2013. 
①As a whole, the e­book reading rates in 2013 were higher 
in each age group, compared to 2012. ②The percentage gap 
between 2012 and 2013 was the smallest for the eldest group. 
③The percentage of young adults aged 18­29 who read one 
e­book or more in 2012 almost doubled in 2013. ④The e­book 
reading rates of the second youngest group increased from 
25% in 2012 to 42% in 2013. ⑤ About two out of ten 
American adults aged 50­64 read at least one e­book in 2012; 
more than half of the same age group did so in 2013.

28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
The process of job advancement in the field of sports ① is 
often said to be shaped like a pyramid. That is, at the wide 
base are many jobs with high school athletic teams, while at 
the narrow tip are the few, highly desired jobs with 
professional organizations. Thus there are many sports jobs 
altogether, but the competition becomes ② increasingly tough 
as one works their way up. The salaries of various positions 
reflect this pyramid model. For example, high school football 
coaches are typically teachers who ③ paid a little extra for 
their afterclass work. But coaches of the same sport at big 
universities can earn more than $1 million a year, causing 
the salaries of college presidents ④ to look small in 
comparison. One degree higher up is the National Football 
League, ⑤ where head coaches can earn many times more 
than their best­paid campus counterparts.


33. Different goods and services have different values. 
National income accounting requires measuring the value of 
production. The most common measure is Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP). It is the market value of all final goods and 
services produced in a year within a country’s borders. This 
definition excludes any production not traded on markets. 
For example, voluntary labor, such as fixing a friend’s bike 
or helping a neighbor with their lawnmower, constitutes 
unpaid service provision. It is not about a worker earning a 
wage or a consumer buying a service. In a similar fashion, 
housework performed by members of the household is not 
included in the GDP, even though the same work, when 
performed by paid house cleaners, is. These cases mean that 
the official GDP calculations                               . 
[3점]
① do not cover all the actual production
② reflect the value of unpaid housework
③ ignore the principle of supply and demand
④ contain the total amount of a country’s imports
⑤ include the profits only produced by foreign trade

Fishing is the most obvious ocean­based economic activity. 
People in many coastal areas make their living by fishing, 
and fish and shellfish make up a major part of their diet.  
(A)    , about one billion people worldwide rely on fish 
as their main source of animal protein. In terms of fishing 
as an economic activity, the largest segment of world 
fisheries is commercial fishing. Fish caught by commercial 
fishermen include salmon, tuna, shellfish and other edible 
species such as squid. Consumers are used to buying these 
seafoods in grocery stores, restaurants, and village markets 
around the world.     (B)    , the supply is not infinite. As 
the world’s population swells, the demand for fishing 
products puts intense pressure on fish populations. The 
worldwide catch of ocean fish swelled from 81 million tons 
in 2003 to 148 million tons in 2010.

Black ice refers to a thin coating of glazed ice on a 
surface. While not truly black, it is virtually transparent, 
allowing black asphalt roadways or the surface below to be 
seen through it—hence the term “black ice”. ① Black ice is 
often practically invisible to drivers or persons stepping on 
it. ② There is, thus, a risk of sudden sliding and subsequent 
accidents. ③ To ensure safe driving, it is best to examine 
your car before starting. ④ On December 1, 2013, heavy 
post­Thanksgiving weekend traffic encountered black ice on 
the westbound I-290 expressway in Worcester, 
Massachusetts. ⑤ A chain reaction series of crashes 
resulted, involving three tractor­trailers and over 60 other 
vehicles.

That’s because she didn’t control for any other factors 
that could be related to both vitamin C and colds.
When researchers find that two variables are related, they 
often automatically leap to the conclusion that those two 
variables have a cause­and­effect relationship. ( ① ) For 
example, suppose a researcher found that people who took 
vitamin C every day reported having fewer colds than people 
who didn’t. ( ② ) Upon finding these results, she wrote a 
paper saying vitamin C prevents colds, using this data as 
evidence. ( ③ ) Now, while it may be true that vitamin C 
does prevent colds, this researcher’s study can’t claim that. 
( ④ ) For example, people who take vitamin C every day 
may be more health­conscious overall, washing their hands 
more often and exercising more. ( ⑤ ) Until you do a 
controlled experiment, you can’t make a cause­and­effect 
conclusion based on relationships you find. [3점]

Then one doctor suggested that the babies be held 
several times daily. 
The need for touch may seem like common sense. ( ① ) 
However, in the early 1900s, people in Europe believed that 
touching newborns was not good for them and they thought 
that it would spread germs and make the babies weak and 
whiny. ( ② ) In the orphanages at that time, it was not 
permitted to cuddle newborn babies. ( ③ ) The babies were 
well fed and cared for, but many of them became ill. ( ④ ) 
The sick babies began to get better gradually. ( ⑤ ) Recent 
research that has confirmed the importance of touch for 
babies encourages parents and nurses to touch and stroke 
premature babies as much as possible.

The subjective approach to probability is based mostly 
on opinions, feelings, or hopes. Therefore, we don’t 
typically use this approach in real scientific attempts.
(A) But the probability of an event in either case is mostly 
subjective, and although this approach isn’t scientific, it 
sure makes for some great sports talk amongst the 
fans.
(B) Although the actual probability that the Ohio State 
football team will win the national championship is out 
there somewhere, no one knows what it is. Some fans 
will have ideas about what that chance is based on how 
much they love or hate Ohio State.
(C) Other people will take a slightly more scientific 
approach―evaluating players’ stats, analyzing all the 
statistics of the Ohio State team over the last 100 
years, looking at the strength of the competition, and 
so on.

Keith Chen, a professor at Yale, had a question about 
what would happen if he could teach a group of monkeys 
to use money. Chen went to work with seven male 
monkeys at a lab.
(A) Once they learned how to use the coins, it turned out 
that individual monkeys had strong preferences for 
different treats. The monkey would exchange his coins 
for whichever food he preferred.
(B) So Chen gave the monkey a coin and then showed a 
treat. Whenever the monkey gave the coin back to 
Chen, he got the treat. It took months, but the 
monkeys eventually learned that the coins could buy the 
treats.
(C) When Chen gave a monkey a coin, he sniffed it and, 
after determining he couldn’t eat it, he tossed it aside. 
When Chen repeated this, the monkey started tossing 
the coin at him.

In today’s marketing and advertising­soaked world, 
people cannot escape brands. The younger they are when 
they start using a brand or product, the more likely they 
are to keep using it for years to come. But that’s not 
the only reason companies are aiming their marketing 
and advertising at younger consumers. As James U. 
McNeal, a professor at Texas A&M University, puts it, 
󰡒Seventy­five percent of spontaneous food purchases 
can be traced to a nagging child. And one out of two 
mothers will buy a food simply because her child 
requests it. To trigger desire in a child is to trigger 
desire in the whole family.󰡓 In other words, kids have 
power over spending in their households, they have 
power over their grandparents and they have power over 
their babysitters. That’s why companies use tricks to 
manipulate their minds.

Years ago, the G.E. Company was faced with the 
delicate task of removing Charles Steinmetz from the 
head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first 
magnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as 
the head of the calculating department. Yet the company 
didn’t dare offend the man. He was indispensable - and 
highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They 
made him Consulting Engineer of G.E. - a new title for 
work he was already doing - and let someone else head 
up the department. Steinmetz was happy. So were the 
officers of G.E. They had done it without a storm by 
letting him save face.
How important, how vitally important that is! And how 
few of us ever stop to think of it! We do not think 
about the feelings of others, getting our own way, 
finding fault, and criticizing an employee in front of 
others, without ever considering the hurt to the other 
person’s pride. On the contrary, a few minutes’ thought, 
a considerate word or two, and a genuine understanding 
of the other person’s attitude would go so far toward 
relieving the hurt. Even if we are right and the other 
person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by 
causing someone to lose face. A legendary French author 
once wrote: 󰡒I have no right to say or do anything that 
diminishes a man in his own eyes.󰡓What matters is not 
what we think of him, but what he thinks of himself. 
Hurting a man’s                    is a crime.

(A)
On Christmas Eve in 2002, the W­Mart in Cleburne, 
Texas, was jammed and hectic. Dozens of people were 
waiting in long lines at checkout counters to purchase 
presents that would be next­morning treasures under 
someone’s tree. Emily was standing in cashier Melissa’s 
line. Emily lived on government support. Her clothes 
were worn; (a) her hands were those of a person who’d 
worked hard for what she had. 
(B)
And then an amazing thing happened. At the back of 
the line, a woman took out (b) her handbag, pulled out 
$100 and passed it forward. As the cash moved up the 
line, a twenty­dollar bill was added here, a ten­dollar bill 
there. Someone threw in a bunch of dollars. When the 
collection finally reached the register, Melissa counted 
$220. Strangers had fulfilled a poor woman’s Christmas 
wish to give her son his dream gift. The people in 
Melissa’s line in the Cleburne, Texas, W­Mart on that 
Christmas Eve had become one.
(C)
She held a single item in her arms as she patiently 
waited to move to the front of the line. Her son would 
get the one present he had asked for: a video game 
player. (c) She had saved all year for this; with tax, 
the total would be close to $220. As Melissa scanned 
the game player’s bar code into her register, the 
woman panicked. Where was her money? It wasn’t 
where (d) she remembered putting it earlier in the day. 
Her fear became obvious to the customers in line 
behind her as she started to cry.
(D)
‘Why my line?’ Melissa thought as she watched the 
frantic woman search through (e) her clothes. She was 
going to have to call her manager to cancel the sale and 
return the game player to a locked shelf. She’d have to 
shut down her checkout line and wait for the manager to 
come from another part of the crowded store. This was 
not something that any store manager or cashier wants 
on Christmas Eve.
