Years ago, the G.E. Company was faced with the 
delicate task of removing Charles Steinmetz from the 
head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first 
magnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as 
the head of the calculating department. Yet the company 
didn’t dare offend the man. He was indispensable - and 
highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They 
made him Consulting Engineer of G.E. - a new title for 
work he was already doing - and let someone else head 
up the department. Steinmetz was happy. So were the 
officers of G.E. They had done it without a storm by 
letting him save face.
How important, how vitally important that is! And how 
few of us ever stop to think of it! We do not think 
about the feelings of others, getting our own way, 
finding fault, and criticizing an employee in front of 
others, without ever considering the hurt to the other 
person’s pride. On the contrary, a few minutes’ thought, 
a considerate word or two, and a genuine understanding 
of the other person’s attitude would go so far toward 
relieving the hurt. Even if we are right and the other 
person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by 
causing someone to lose face. A legendary French author 
once wrote: 󰡒I have no right to say or do anything that

what we think of him, but what he thinks of himself. 
Hurting a man’s                    is a crime.
