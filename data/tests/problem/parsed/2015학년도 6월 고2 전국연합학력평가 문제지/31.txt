31. Ant colonies have their own personalities, which are       
. Having a personality means 
showing a consistent pattern of behavior over time. Colonies 
of several hundreds of ants show differences in the way 
they behave, just like individual people do. Researchers from 
the University of Arizona studied colonies of rock ants 
across the western US, both in the wild and in the lab. 
They found certain behaviors go together―for example, a 
colony that explores more widely for food also tends to 
respond more aggressively to an intruder. Such a colony has 
a more “risk­taking” personality and this is more common in 
the north, where the climate is colder. The study suggests 
those more adventurous personalities could be an adaptation 
to the limited period of activity caused by the long, snowy 
northern climate. [3점]
