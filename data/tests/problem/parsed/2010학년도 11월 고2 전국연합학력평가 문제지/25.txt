25.  Baseball players often place a weighted ring around their bat 
before taking their warm­up swings. They say repeatedly 
swinging a heavier bat makes the unweighted bat feel lighter in 
comparison. The primary principle underlying this effect is 
known as perceptual contrast. Simply put, the characteristics of 
objects are perceived in comparison to others. If you are asked 
to pick up a ten­pound weight in a gymnasium, it will appear 
lighter if you had first picked up a twenty­pound weight and 
heavier if you had first picked up a five­pound weight. Nothing 
has actually changed about the ten­pound weight except your 
perception of it. This psychological process holds for almost 
any type of judgment you could make. In every case the 
perceptual process is the same:                               colors 
perception.
