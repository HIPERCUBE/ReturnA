Jason woke up in the middle of the night, when he heard glass 
shattering. From the balcony of the fourth­floor room, Jason saw 
black smoke pouring from the windows of the hotel. He watched 
o ne window blow out, and then another, and heard people shouting. Some young guests were throwing ropes made from 
twisted bedsheets off their balconies, and a couple of them were 
trying to climb down. There was so much smoke that he couldn’t 
see five feet in front of him. Jason ran out into the corridor and 
began pounding on doors and shouting, “Fire!” He heard people 
yelling and trying to get out in sheer chaos. He pulled the fire 
alarm system and nothing happened. He didn’t know what to do 
at that moment.
