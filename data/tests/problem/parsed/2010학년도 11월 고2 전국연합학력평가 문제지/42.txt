42.  How many times a day do you brush your teeth? Do you keep 
a strict schedule for keeping your teeth clean? Of course this is 
good for having strong, healthy teeth but now it seems this 
could also help prevent heart disease ― double the reason to 
keep your teeth clean! If you don’t brush your teeth properly 
your mouth can become inflamed with bacteria which can lead 
to gum disease. As well as causing your teeth to fall out, 
inflammation and bleeding of the gums can lead to your arteries 
becoming blocked, which is known to lead to heart attacks. Be 
sure to keep brushing your teeth. Even if there is only a chance 
it will help your heart, it will definitely still help your teeth!
