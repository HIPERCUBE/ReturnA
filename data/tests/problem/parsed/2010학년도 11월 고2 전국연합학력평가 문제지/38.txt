38.  Studies have shown that time spent in nature does us good. 
Specifically, a recent study done with 1,200 people found that 
even just five minutes in a leafy park can significantly boost 
our mood. It might be because we inhaled some bacteria, named 
mycobacterium vaccae, among the leaves and grass. Injecting 
this bacteria into mice has already been shown to increase 
serotonin levels and decrease anxiety. But the researchers 
wondered if it might have a subsequent effect on learning. 
They fed the bacteria to mice and then tested the mice in a 
maze. These mice navigated the maze twice as fast as mice 
who received no bacteria. This might give a clue to why we get 
an improvement in mood and clear thinking, when we just take
