26.  There’s an old joke that goes: There are two kinds of people 
in the world ― those who believe that everything can be divided 
into two categories and the rest of you. Human beings somehow 
seem naturally inclined to see life in contrasting pairs. East 
versus West. Mars versus Venus. Logic versus emotion. Left 
versus right. Yet, in most realms we usually don’t have to   
and it’s often dangerous if we do. For 
instance, logic without emotion is a chilly, cold­hearted 
existence. Emotion without logic is a chaotic, hysterical world 
where the clocks are never right and the buses always late. In 
the end, yin always needs yang.
* yin: 음(陰)   ** yang: 양(陽)
