In 1990, Elizabeth Newton, a psychologist, studied a simple 
game in which she assigned people to one of two roles ―  
‘tappers’ or ‘listeners.’ Tappers received a list of well known 
songs such as ‘Happy Birthday to You.’ Each tapper was 
asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener. 
The listener’s job was to guess the song, based on the 
rhythm being tapped. Before the listeners guessed the song, 
the tappers predicted the listeners would guess 50 percent 
of the songs correctly. But the result was that listeners 
guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs. Why? When a tapper 
tapped, she was hearing the song in her head. Meanwhile, 
the listeners couldn’t hear the tune ― all they could hear 
was a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind of bizarre 
Morse Code. That is, the tappers couldn’t understand the 
position of the listeners who didn’t know the song title.
󰀻
The listeners’ guessing was much less      (A)      than the 
tappers expected, which means the tappers couldn’t imagine 
what it was like to       (B)       knowledge of the song title.
(A) (B)
① correct …… lack
② correct …… deny
③ logical …… share
④ diverse …… accept
⑤ diverse …… expand

(A)
I remember it like it was yesterday. Tall and thin, I was 
pushing my way through the crowded hallway in the high 
school. All of a sudden a big voice sounded like a 
thunderclap behind me: “Hey, son!” It was (a) Mr. William 
Lester. Besides being the basketball coach of the school, he 
also had a reputation as (b) the school disciplinarian, so the 
first thing I thought was, “Uh­oh, somebody’s in trouble.”
(B)
Since that day when Coach called me out and said, “Hey, 
son! Yes, you,” everything ― becoming a basketball player, 
then (c) a coach, and writing a book ― has happened to me. 
Up until then, I hadn’t been a troublemaker, but I was 
drifting. I had no idea what my goals were or where I was 
heading. At that very moment, it was he who showed me 
the right way by teaching me how to play basketball.
(C)
He fixed me with his piercing eyes and shouted, “Yeah, 
you, son!” I started walking toward him. I stopped in front 
of him, trembling in fear. “Son!” (d) he said, looking me up 
and down, “You’re too tall to be walking these halls and not 
playing basketball. I’ll see you in the gym at 3:30 today.” 
“But Coach!” I complained, “I’ve never played basketball.” 
“Son! Did you hear what I said? I’ll see you at 3:30!” Then 
he walked away.
(D)
In addition, he helped me see something bigger out there. 
He told me, “You can get a college scholarship.” When I 
said, “But I don’t know how,” he said, “(e) I am going to 
show you and work with you. You can do it.” And he was 
right. I knew it the day I set foot on a college campus, 
scholarship in hand. He believed in me. I’ve thought, if only 
every kid had a Coach Lester to believe in him, what a 
difference it would make.

The rise of social media sites like Facebook, MySpace and 
Flikr, has been accompanied by fears that we are producing 
the most narcissistic generation in history. But is there any 
actual scientific evidence for that view? A study of 14,000 
college students between 1979 and 2009 was presented this 
weekend at the annual meeting of Association for 
Psychological Science. The research found today’s young 
people are 40 percent less                        than college 
students from 30 years ago in their real lives, not the virtual 
ones. For instance, today’s students are less likely to agree 
with statements like, “I sometimes try to understand my 
friends better by imagining how things look from their 
perspective,” and “I often have tender and concerned feelings 
for people who are less fortunate than me.”
According to one of the lead researchers, Ed O’Brien, “It’s 
harder for today’s college students to share their emotions 
with others because so much of their social lives is done 
through a computer and not through real life interaction.” He 
also notes that students are facing increasing competition, so 
they’re spending much more time working on their grades and 
resumés, instead of socializing.
