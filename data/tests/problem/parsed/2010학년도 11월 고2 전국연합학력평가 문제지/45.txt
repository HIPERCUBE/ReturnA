In 1990, Elizabeth Newton, a psychologist, studied a simple 
game in which she assigned people to one of two roles ―  
‘tappers’ or ‘listeners.’ Tappers received a list of well known 
songs such as ‘Happy Birthday to You.’ Each tapper was 
asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener. 
The listener’s job was to guess the song, based on the 
rhythm being tapped. Before the listeners guessed the song, 
the tappers predicted the listeners would guess 50 percent 
of the songs correctly. But the result was that listeners 
guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs. Why? When a tapper 
tapped, she was hearing the song in her head. Meanwhile, 
the listeners couldn’t hear the tune ― all they could hear 
was a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind of bizarre 
Morse Code. That is, the tappers couldn’t understand the 
position of the listeners who didn’t know the song title.

what it was like to       (B)       knowledge of the song title.
