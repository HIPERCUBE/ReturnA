Participating in extracurricular activities is a very good thing, 
but some people don’t know where to draw the line. The result? 
Joining too many clubs can reduce a large amount of your free 
time. This is especially true during certain crunch times. For 
example, if you work for a school newspaper and your deadline 
is approaching, you know that you might have to spend evenings 
and even weekends making sure the paper is as perfect as you 
want it to be. Pacing is important. The point is this: If you don’t 
exercise some moderation in terms of your extracurricular 
activities, you can become awfully stressed out about the tasks 
you absolutely need to complete. So get involved in the activities 
that are most meaningful to you, and make sure you don’t 
overextend yourself.
