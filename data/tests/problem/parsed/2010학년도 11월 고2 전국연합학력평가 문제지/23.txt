Arabs have a saying which reflects respect for the elderly: A 
house without an elderly person is like an orchard without a 
well. ① This same respect is taught in most Asian cultures in 
which children read stories of exemplary sons and daughters 
who care for their parents through good times and bad. ② The 
main reason behind this great respect for the elderly is that, in 
such places as Korea, an appreciation of the past is highly 
valued. ③ Malaysians frequently admire the more senior or 
elderly member of an organization, and this person will 
generally be the first to speak at a meeting. ④ In Singapore, 
the elderly might participate in volunteer services more than 
the youth. ⑤ In addition, there is great obedience and 
politeness to senior citizens in Japan.
