Five thousand years ago, the craters of extinct volcanoes in 
Arabia were used as this by farmers for their irrigation water. 
Dry climate and water shortage in India led to early 
development of water management techniques, including the 
building of this in 3,000 BC. This may be created in river 
valleys by the construction of a dam or may be built by 
conventional construction techniques, like brickwork. This is 
used to provide raw water feed to a water treatment plant 
which delivers drinking water through water mains. This does 
not simply hold water until it is needed; it can also be the first 
part of the water treatment process.

I have been married to Mick for 22 years. My problem is that I

forgetful that ① he often doesn’t know where he put his cell 
phone. Recently, our family planned to go to dinner. When Mick 
didn’t show up, we tried to contact ② him for one hour. We 
were worried sick, so we called Bill, one of his friends. We 
expected ③ him to know my husband’s whereabouts, but he was 
no help to us. One hour later, Mick came back home and 
apologetically said that ④ he seemed to have left his cell phone 
beneath the pillow on our bed. At that very moment, his cell 
phone began vibrating in the pocket of the coat ⑤ he was

My younger brother, Martin, has a chance for a marvelous job 
next year on condition that he speaks English fluently. As he 
has never studied it at all, however, he must learn it very 
quickly. What is the best way of doing this? Should he try to do 
it on his own with the help of records or CDs or should he go to 
a local language school where the teachers are all American? It 
is an awful nuisance to be bothered with all these questions, I 
know, but as you are a teacher of English to foreigners you are 
the person most qualified to help us find appropriate ways to 
study English. Martin joins me in apologizing for troubling you, 
and we both send you our best wishes.

In the past, young athletes would play hockey or baseball.

edge, the better. More and more young athletes are taking part 
in risky activities ② called ‘extreme sports’ or ‘X­sports’ such 
as mountain biking, snowboarding over cliffs, and bungee 
jumping. Extreme sports have become a whole new area of 
sports, with a high level of skill and specialized equipment to

special Olympics for extreme sports ④ including snow 
mountain biking and ice climbing. An X­games competition is

Arabs have a saying which reflects respect for the elderly: A 
house without an elderly person is like an orchard without a 
well. ① This same respect is taught in most Asian cultures in 
which children read stories of exemplary sons and daughters 
who care for their parents through good times and bad. ② The 
main reason behind this great respect for the elderly is that, in 
such places as Korea, an appreciation of the past is highly 
valued. ③ Malaysians frequently admire the more senior or 
elderly member of an organization, and this person will 
generally be the first to speak at a meeting. ④ In Singapore, 
the elderly might participate in volunteer services more than 
the youth. ⑤ In addition, there is great obedience and 
politeness to senior citizens in Japan.

24.  In 2003, there was one car line that sold more than any other 
in the U.S. Ironically, it had previously proven itself to be an 
ineffective profit­maker for the manufacturer. Why did its sales 
skyrocket all of a sudden? It couldn’t have been driven by 
advertising. Nor was there any price change to account for the 
unexpected popularity. The reason for its success was 
paradoxical: Its manufacturer had decided to discontinue the line 
due to poor sales. In response to the announcement that the car 
line would soon no longer be available, sales jumped like never 
before. Why? The answer lies in the                 principle: 
People show a greater desire for an object when they learn that 
it is unique, available in limited quantities, or obtainable for 
only a limited time.
① identity ② scarcity ③ creation
④ tolerance ⑤ neutrality
25.  Baseball players often place a weighted ring around their bat 
before taking their warm­up swings. They say repeatedly 
swinging a heavier bat makes the unweighted bat feel lighter in 
comparison. The primary principle underlying this effect is 
known as perceptual contrast. Simply put, the characteristics of 
objects are perceived in comparison to others. If you are asked 
to pick up a ten­pound weight in a gymnasium, it will appear 
lighter if you had first picked up a twenty­pound weight and 
heavier if you had first picked up a five­pound weight. Nothing 
has actually changed about the ten­pound weight except your 
perception of it. This psychological process holds for almost 
any type of judgment you could make. In every case the 
perceptual process is the same:                               colors 
perception.

26.  There’s an old joke that goes: There are two kinds of people 
in the world ― those who believe that everything can be divided 
into two categories and the rest of you. Human beings somehow 
seem naturally inclined to see life in contrasting pairs. East 
versus West. Mars versus Venus. Logic versus emotion. Left 
versus right. Yet, in most realms we usually don’t have to   
and it’s often dangerous if we do. For 
instance, logic without emotion is a chilly, cold­hearted 
existence. Emotion without logic is a chaotic, hysterical world 
where the clocks are never right and the buses always late. In 
the end, yin always needs yang.
* yin: 음(陰)   ** yang: 양(陽)
① pick sides ② skip lessons
③ hide emotions ④ avoid challenges
⑤ combine categories
27.  The question of tax equality is a major concern for many 
people in underdeveloped countries. Tax equality refers to the 
way taxes are distributed among people. Even if tax collections 
were exactly the right amount to pay for government goods and 
services demanded by people, there could be concern that    
. For example, some 
taxpayers may be paying more than what they believe is a fair 
amount, and some may be paying less than what others believe 
is a fair amount. So, in addition to the fear that government is 
too big and taxes generally too high, there is the fear that 
taxes are too low for certain taxpayers and too high for others.
① collected tax couldn’t meet the budget
② the government overly raises tax rates
③ tax distributions are far from being fair
④ some taxpayers try to avoid paying tax
⑤ too much tax might be spent in a sector
28.  To help us experience more joy in school and in the 
workplace, we can cognitively redefine our experiences by 
ridding ourselves of the prejudice we have against work. A 
study run by Donald Hebb back in 1930 can help us understand 
how this reformation can take place. Six hundred students 
between the ages of six and fifteen were told that they no 
longer needed to do any schoolwork. If they misbehaved in 
class, their punishment was to go out and play; if they behaved, 
their reward was getting to do more work. Hebb reports, “In 
these circumstances, all of the pupils discovered within a day 
or two that they preferred work to no work.” If we can    
and do the 
same for our children, we will ultimately be much better off.

Jason woke up in the middle of the night, when he heard glass 
shattering. From the balcony of the fourth­floor room, Jason saw 
black smoke pouring from the windows of the hotel. He watched 
o ne window blow out, and then another, and heard people shouting. Some young guests were throwing ropes made from 
twisted bedsheets off their balconies, and a couple of them were 
trying to climb down. There was so much smoke that he couldn’t 
see five feet in front of him. Jason ran out into the corridor and 
began pounding on doors and shouting, “Fire!” He heard people 
yelling and trying to get out in sheer chaos. He pulled the fire 
alarm system and nothing happened. He didn’t know what to do

A 3×3 magic square is filled with numbers in order from 1 
through 9. The numbers are arranged so that the sum of the 
numbers in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is 
always the ① same, that is, 15. It begins by placing number 1 in 
the ② center square of the top row. Then the basic movement 
f o r   filling the squares is diagonally up and ③ right. When a move leaves the 3×3 square, it is wrapped around so that a number 
going from the top returns on the ④ bottom(1→2, 8→9), and a 
number going from the right returns on the left(2→3, 7→8). If a 
filled square is encountered, one moves vertically ⑤ up one 
square instead, then the method continues as before. When a 
number reaches the top right corner, the following number 
moves down. How about trying a 5×5, 7×7 or 9×9 magic square

33.  If you are the owner of a digital camera and have kids, you 
should be taking pictures of them at least a couple of times a 
month while they’re young. The first advantage of doing this is 
that if you constantly take pictures of your children, they will 
surely feel loved and adored by you, their parents. They might 
even end up doing the same for their kids. Secondly, if at any 
point in the future you feel like looking back at things that 
happened, having photos of your kids will definitely help remind 
you of many things. Lastly, if ever in life there is an emergency 
such as a lost child or you for some reason need pictures of 
your kids, then you will have many available if you start to take 
pictures of them now.

34.  The children are excited and giggling. It seems like a funny 
game ― stand by a sink and scrub your hands. But in the 
poorest parts of Karachi, Pakistan, the lesson is vital for 
disease prevention, and the teachers get great results. “After a 
few sessions,” says a public health expert, “the mothers tell us 
children are constantly washing their hands at home, many 
times a day. And not just their own. They’re making their 
brothers and sisters wash their hands too.” That ripple effect 
helps save lives. Washing hands with soap for at least 20 
seconds costs pennies ― and when taught and done properly, 
reduces the rates of infections, such as pneumonia and 
diarrheal diseases, that kill more than 3.5 million kids under 
age five every year worldwide.

② the main causes of infectious diseases in poor countries

Bangalore is the capital of the South Indian state of Karnataka 
and it is India’s third most populous city. It lies in the heart of 
the Mysore Plateau at an average elevation of 920 meters. Due 
to its high elevation, Bangalore usually enjoys a moderate 
climate throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can 
make things very uncomfortable in the summer. Though 
historical references to the city predate 900 BC, a modern 
written history of continuous settlement exists only from 1537. 
Today, Bangalore is known as the ‘Silicon Valley of India’ 
because of its position as the nation’s leading IT exporting area. 
Bangalore is a major metropolis and the fastest growing 
economic hub in India.

There are about 32 species of cave fishes which have been 
observed to exhibit the cave­dwelling behavior. Most of these 
are small species but adults of one species reach a length of 
almost 20cm. A few of these species have functional eyes but, 
for the vast majority, vision is of little use. Some of them are 
completely blind, with the vestiges of eyes still visible beneath 
a thin layer of skin. Many cave fishes have little or no skin 
color as these species have no need for body coloring, a feature 
widely used for communication purposes among other fish. 
Some cave fishes appear to be a pinkish color, but this is the 
result of the animals’ blood vessels showing through their pale 
skin.

38.  Studies have shown that time spent in nature does us good. 
Specifically, a recent study done with 1,200 people found that 
even just five minutes in a leafy park can significantly boost 
our mood. It might be because we inhaled some bacteria, named 
mycobacterium vaccae, among the leaves and grass. Injecting 
this bacteria into mice has already been shown to increase 
serotonin levels and decrease anxiety. But the researchers 
wondered if it might have a subsequent effect on learning. 
They fed the bacteria to mice and then tested the mice in a 
maze. These mice navigated the maze twice as fast as mice 
who received no bacteria. This might give a clue to why we get 
an improvement in mood and clear thinking, when we just take

39.  In terms of the energy and competence required, gratitude is 
one of the easiest of all principles in life to apply. Though it 
also generally returns rich profits, it isn’t vastly utilized. Why? 
Perhaps because people don’t have enough humility, it can be 
hard to acknowledge the need to be helped. Or because people 
don’t have enough courage ― a person might be too shy to tell 
another how much he or she means. Yet, to become a person 
with greatness, you should be quick to exhibit gratitude for 
everything. You should not take life or the kindness of others 
for granted. You must not hesitate to say thanks and be among 
the first to express praise. Many have found the best sleeping 
pill comes from counting one’s blessings, naming them one by 
one.
① Too much praise might be fruitless.
② Those without modesty can’t succeed.
③ Do not hesitate to express appreciation.
④ Be the first one to find fault with yourself.
⑤ Demonstrate your courage whenever possible.

Acupuncture has long been tried against all sorts of 
illnesses, from pains to infertility. However, the Western 
world treats the procedure with skepticism, wondering how 
sticking needles in your skin can be good for you.
(A) As a result, they found that the tissues around the treated 
acupoints get flooded with adenosine, a chemical providing 
relief by preventing pain signals from reaching the brain.
(B) This reduced the animals’ discomfort, as did treating them 
with drugs that boost the amount of adenosine. So 
acupuncture’s effect as a painkiller was finally pinned down.
(C) To clear the doubt, some scientists tried the technique on 
mice that had a pain in their paws, inserting and rotating 
the needles in the acupoints from Chinese medicine.

41.  You get a dry mouth during public speaking because when 
you are nervous the body is set into a ‘fight or flight’ state. 
This is caused by an activation of the autonomic nervous 
system. It is seen throughout the animal kingdom, and has 
evolved to help animals deal with dangerous situations ― when 
escaping from predators, for example. The nerves are 
selectively activated, depending on how important they are for 
the response. Because eating is not considered to be important 
at this time ― you want to get out of the situation ― the nerves 
to your mouth that control the salivary glands are suppressed, 
so your mouth dries up. In addition, your pupils become larger 
and the blood vessels to your muscles and heart are enlarged.

good for having strong, healthy teeth but now it seems this

your mouth can become inflamed with bacteria which can lead 
to gum disease. As well as causing your teeth to fall out, 
inflammation and bleeding of the gums can lead to your arteries 
becoming blocked, which is known to lead to heart attacks. Be 
sure to keep brushing your teeth. Even if there is only a chance 
it will help your heart, it will definitely still help your teeth!

By contrast, the most heavily populated parts of the 
highlands have enough cold weather to keep down the 
insects.
The people who first settled in the rainforest of the Amazon 
River lived by hunting and gathering, not by farming. ( ① ) 
Tropical diseases and the limits of their food supply kept the 
population small. ( ② ) It has been said that it is the small 
animals in the rainforest, not the large ones, that make people’s 
life miserable. ( ③ ) Mosquitoes and other insects are more 
than just pests, because they carry diseases like malaria and 
yellow fever that can greatly weaken humans. ( ④ ) These 
insects are always present, since the tropical forest never has 
a frost that will terminate them. ( ⑤ ) The highlands also have

Participating in extracurricular activities is a very good thing, 
but some people don’t know where to draw the line. The result? 
Joining too many clubs can reduce a large amount of your free 
time. This is especially true during certain crunch times. For 
example, if you work for a school newspaper and your deadline 
is approaching, you know that you might have to spend evenings 
and even weekends making sure the paper is as perfect as you 
want it to be. Pacing is important. The point is this: If you don’t 
exercise some moderation in terms of your extracurricular 
activities, you can become awfully stressed out about the tasks 
you absolutely need to complete. So get involved in the activities 
that are most meaningful to you, and make sure you don’t 
overextend yourself.

In 1990, Elizabeth Newton, a psychologist, studied a simple 
game in which she assigned people to one of two roles ―  
‘tappers’ or ‘listeners.’ Tappers received a list of well known 
songs such as ‘Happy Birthday to You.’ Each tapper was 
asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener. 
The listener’s job was to guess the song, based on the 
rhythm being tapped. Before the listeners guessed the song, 
the tappers predicted the listeners would guess 50 percent 
of the songs correctly. But the result was that listeners 
guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs. Why? When a tapper 
tapped, she was hearing the song in her head. Meanwhile, 
the listeners couldn’t hear the tune ― all they could hear 
was a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind of bizarre 
Morse Code. That is, the tappers couldn’t understand the 
position of the listeners who didn’t know the song title.

The listeners’ guessing was much less      (A)      than the

(A)
I remember it like it was yesterday. Tall and thin, I was 
pushing my way through the crowded hallway in the high 
school. All of a sudden a big voice sounded like a 
thunderclap behind me: “Hey, son!” It was (a) Mr. William 
Lester. Besides being the basketball coach of the school, he 
also had a reputation as (b) the school disciplinarian, so the 
first thing I thought was, “Uh­oh, somebody’s in trouble.”
(B)
Since that day when Coach called me out and said, “Hey, 
son! Yes, you,” everything ― becoming a basketball player, 
then (c) a coach, and writing a book ― has happened to me. 
Up until then, I hadn’t been a troublemaker, but I was 
drifting. I had no idea what my goals were or where I was 
heading. At that very moment, it was he who showed me 
the right way by teaching me how to play basketball.
(C)
He fixed me with his piercing eyes and shouted, “Yeah, 
you, son!” I started walking toward him. I stopped in front 
of him, trembling in fear. “Son!” (d) he said, looking me up 
and down, “You’re too tall to be walking these halls and not 
playing basketball. I’ll see you in the gym at 3:30 today.” 
“But Coach!” I complained, “I’ve never played basketball.” 
“Son! Did you hear what I said? I’ll see you at 3:30!” Then 
he walked away.
(D)
In addition, he helped me see something bigger out there. 
He told me, “You can get a college scholarship.” When I 
said, “But I don’t know how,” he said, “(e) I am going to 
show you and work with you. You can do it.” And he was 
right. I knew it the day I set foot on a college campus, 
scholarship in hand. He believed in me. I’ve thought, if only 
every kid had a Coach Lester to believe in him, what a 
difference it would make.

The rise of social media sites like Facebook, MySpace and 
Flikr, has been accompanied by fears that we are producing 
the most narcissistic generation in history. But is there any 
actual scientific evidence for that view? A study of 14,000 
college students between 1979 and 2009 was presented this 
weekend at the annual meeting of Association for 
Psychological Science. The research found today’s young 
people are 40 percent less                        than college 
students from 30 years ago in their real lives, not the virtual 
ones. For instance, today’s students are less likely to agree 
with statements like, “I sometimes try to understand my 
friends better by imagining how things look from their 
perspective,” and “I often have tender and concerned feelings 
for people who are less fortunate than me.”
According to one of the lead researchers, Ed O’Brien, “It’s 
harder for today’s college students to share their emotions 
with others because so much of their social lives is done 
through a computer and not through real life interaction.” He 
also notes that students are facing increasing competition, so 
they’re spending much more time working on their grades and 
resumés, instead of socializing.
