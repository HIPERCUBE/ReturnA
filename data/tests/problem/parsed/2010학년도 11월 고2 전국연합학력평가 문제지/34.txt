34.  The children are excited and giggling. It seems like a funny 
game ― stand by a sink and scrub your hands. But in the 
poorest parts of Karachi, Pakistan, the lesson is vital for 
disease prevention, and the teachers get great results. “After a 
few sessions,” says a public health expert, “the mothers tell us 
children are constantly washing their hands at home, many 
times a day. And not just their own. They’re making their 
brothers and sisters wash their hands too.” That ripple effect 
helps save lives. Washing hands with soap for at least 20 
seconds costs pennies ― and when taught and done properly, 
reduces the rates of infections, such as pneumonia and 
diarrheal diseases, that kill more than 3.5 million kids under 
age five every year worldwide.
