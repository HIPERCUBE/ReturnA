41.  You get a dry mouth during public speaking because when 
you are nervous the body is set into a ‘fight or flight’ state. 
This is caused by an activation of the autonomic nervous 
system. It is seen throughout the animal kingdom, and has 
evolved to help animals deal with dangerous situations ― when 
escaping from predators, for example. The nerves are 
selectively activated, depending on how important they are for 
the response. Because eating is not considered to be important 
at this time ― you want to get out of the situation ― the nerves 
to your mouth that control the salivary glands are suppressed, 
so your mouth dries up. In addition, your pupils become larger 
and the blood vessels to your muscles and heart are enlarged.
