(A)
I remember it like it was yesterday. Tall and thin, I was 
pushing my way through the crowded hallway in the high 
school. All of a sudden a big voice sounded like a 
thunderclap behind me: “Hey, son!” It was (a) Mr. William 
Lester. Besides being the basketball coach of the school, he 
also had a reputation as (b) the school disciplinarian, so the 
first thing I thought was, “Uh­oh, somebody’s in trouble.”
(B)
Since that day when Coach called me out and said, “Hey, 
son! Yes, you,” everything ― becoming a basketball player, 
then (c) a coach, and writing a book ― has happened to me. 
Up until then, I hadn’t been a troublemaker, but I was 
drifting. I had no idea what my goals were or where I was 
heading. At that very moment, it was he who showed me 
the right way by teaching me how to play basketball.
(C)
He fixed me with his piercing eyes and shouted, “Yeah, 
you, son!” I started walking toward him. I stopped in front 
of him, trembling in fear. “Son!” (d) he said, looking me up 
and down, “You’re too tall to be walking these halls and not 
playing basketball. I’ll see you in the gym at 3:30 today.” 
“But Coach!” I complained, “I’ve never played basketball.” 
“Son! Did you hear what I said? I’ll see you at 3:30!” Then 
he walked away.
(D)
In addition, he helped me see something bigger out there. 
He told me, “You can get a college scholarship.” When I 
said, “But I don’t know how,” he said, “(e) I am going to 
show you and work with you. You can do it.” And he was 
right. I knew it the day I set foot on a college campus, 
scholarship in hand. He believed in me. I’ve thought, if only 
every kid had a Coach Lester to believe in him, what a 
difference it would make.
