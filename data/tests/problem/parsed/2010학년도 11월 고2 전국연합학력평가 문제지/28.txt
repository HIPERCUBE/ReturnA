28.  To help us experience more joy in school and in the 
workplace, we can cognitively redefine our experiences by 
ridding ourselves of the prejudice we have against work. A 
study run by Donald Hebb back in 1930 can help us understand 
how this reformation can take place. Six hundred students 
between the ages of six and fifteen were told that they no 
longer needed to do any schoolwork. If they misbehaved in 
class, their punishment was to go out and play; if they behaved, 
their reward was getting to do more work. Hebb reports, “In 
these circumstances, all of the pupils discovered within a day 
or two that they preferred work to no work.” If we can    
and do the 
same for our children, we will ultimately be much better off.
