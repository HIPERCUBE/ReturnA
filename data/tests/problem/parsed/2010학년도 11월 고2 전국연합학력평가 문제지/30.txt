A 3×3 magic square is filled with numbers in order from 1 
through 9. The numbers are arranged so that the sum of the 
numbers in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is 
always the ① same, that is, 15. It begins by placing number 1 in 
the ② center square of the top row. Then the basic movement 
f o r   filling the squares is diagonally up and ③ right. When a move leaves the 3×3 square, it is wrapped around so that a number 
going from the top returns on the ④ bottom(1→2, 8→9), and a 
number going from the right returns on the left(2→3, 7→8). If a 
filled square is encountered, one moves vertically ⑤ up one 
square instead, then the method continues as before. When a 
number reaches the top right corner, the following number 
moves down. How about trying a 5×5, 7×7 or 9×9 magic square 
by yourself now?
