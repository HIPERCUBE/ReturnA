A 3×3 magic square is filled with numbers in order from 1 
through 9. The numbers are arranged so that the sum of the 
numbers in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is 
always the ① same, that is, 15. It begins by placing number 1 in 
the ② center square of the top row. Then the basic movement 
f o r   filling the squares is diagonally up and ③ right. When a move leaves the 3×3 square, it is wrapped around so that a number 
going from the top returns on the ④ bottom(1→2, 8→9), and a 
number going from the right returns on the left(2→3, 7→8). If a 
filled square is encountered, one moves vertically ⑤ up one 
square instead, then the method continues as before. When a 
number reaches the top right corner, the following number 
moves down. How about trying a 5×5, 7×7 or 9×9 magic square 
by yourself now?
* diagonal: 대각선의
36.  Bangalore에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Bangalore is the capital of the South Indian state of Karnataka 
and it is India’s third most populous city. It lies in the heart of 
the Mysore Plateau at an average elevation of 920 meters. Due 
to its high elevation, Bangalore usually enjoys a moderate 
climate throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can 
make things very uncomfortable in the summer. Though 
historical references to the city predate 900 BC, a modern 
written history of continuous settlement exists only from 1537. 
Today, Bangalore is known as the ‘Silicon Valley of India’ 
because of its position as the nation’s leading IT exporting area. 
Bangalore is a major metropolis and the fastest growing 
economic hub in India.
① Karnataka의 주도이며 인도에서 네 번째로 인구가 많다.

37.  cave fish에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
There are about 32 species of cave fishes which have been 
observed to exhibit the cave­dwelling behavior. Most of these 
are small species but adults of one species reach a length of 
almost 20cm. A few of these species have functional eyes but, 
for the vast majority, vision is of little use. Some of them are 
completely blind, with the vestiges of eyes still visible beneath 
a thin layer of skin. Many cave fishes have little or no skin 
color as these species have no need for body coloring, a feature 
widely used for communication purposes among other fish. 
Some cave fishes appear to be a pinkish color, but this is the 
result of the animals’ blood vessels showing through their pale 
skin.

① 약 32가지 종이 있으며 동굴에서 서식한다.
② 몸의 길이가 거의 20cm까지 자라는 종도 있다.

④ 몸의 색깔 변화를 통해 의사소통을 하는 종이 많다.

38.  Studies have shown that time spent in nature does us good. 
Specifically, a recent study done with 1,200 people found that 
even just five minutes in a leafy park can significantly boost 
our mood. It might be because we inhaled some bacteria, named 
mycobacterium vaccae, among the leaves and grass. Injecting 
this bacteria into mice has already been shown to increase 
serotonin levels and decrease anxiety. But the researchers 
wondered if it might have a subsequent effect on learning. 
They fed the bacteria to mice and then tested the mice in a 
maze. These mice navigated the maze twice as fast as mice 
who received no bacteria. This might give a clue to why we get 
an improvement in mood and clear thinking, when we just take 
a simple stroll through the woods.

39.  In terms of the energy and competence required, gratitude is 
one of the easiest of all principles in life to apply. Though it 
also generally returns rich profits, it isn’t vastly utilized. Why? 
Perhaps because people don’t have enough humility, it can be 
hard to acknowledge the need to be helped. Or because people 
don’t have enough courage ― a person might be too shy to tell 
another how much he or she means. Yet, to become a person 
with greatness, you should be quick to exhibit gratitude for 
everything. You should not take life or the kindness of others 
for granted. You must not hesitate to say thanks and be among 
the first to express praise. Many have found the best sleeping 
pill comes from counting one’s blessings, naming them one by 
one.
① Too much praise might be fruitless.
② Those without modesty can’t succeed.
③ Do not hesitate to express appreciation.
④ Be the first one to find fault with yourself.
⑤ Demonstrate your courage whenever possible.

Acupuncture has long been tried against all sorts of 
illnesses, from pains to infertility. However, the Western 
world treats the procedure with skepticism, wondering how 
sticking needles in your skin can be good for you.
(A) As a result, they found that the tissues around the treated 
acupoints get flooded with adenosine, a chemical providing 
relief by preventing pain signals from reaching the brain.
(B) This reduced the animals’ discomfort, as did treating them 
with drugs that boost the amount of adenosine. So 
acupuncture’s effect as a painkiller was finally pinned down.
(C) To clear the doubt, some scientists tried the technique on 
mice that had a pain in their paws, inserting and rotating 
the needles in the acupoints from Chinese medicine.

41.  You get a dry mouth during public speaking because when 
you are nervous the body is set into a ‘fight or flight’ state. 
This is caused by an activation of the autonomic nervous 
system. It is seen throughout the animal kingdom, and has 
evolved to help animals deal with dangerous situations ― when 
escaping from predators, for example. The nerves are 
selectively activated, depending on how important they are for 
the response. Because eating is not considered to be important 
at this time ― you want to get out of the situation ― the nerves 
to your mouth that control the salivary glands are suppressed, 
so your mouth dries up. In addition, your pupils become larger 
and the blood vessels to your muscles and heart are enlarged.

42.  How many times a day do you brush your teeth? Do you keep 
a strict schedule for keeping your teeth clean? Of course this is 
good for having strong, healthy teeth but now it seems this 
could also help prevent heart disease ― double the reason to 
keep your teeth clean! If you don’t brush your teeth properly 
your mouth can become inflamed with bacteria which can lead 
to gum disease. As well as causing your teeth to fall out, 
inflammation and bleeding of the gums can lead to your arteries 
becoming blocked, which is known to lead to heart attacks. Be 
sure to keep brushing your teeth. Even if there is only a chance 
it will help your heart, it will definitely still help your teeth!

By contrast, the most heavily populated parts of the 
highlands have enough cold weather to keep down the 
insects.
The people who first settled in the rainforest of the Amazon 
River lived by hunting and gathering, not by farming. ( ① ) 
Tropical diseases and the limits of their food supply kept the 
population small. ( ② ) It has been said that it is the small 
animals in the rainforest, not the large ones, that make people’s 
life miserable. ( ③ ) Mosquitoes and other insects are more 
than just pests, because they carry diseases like malaria and 
yellow fever that can greatly weaken humans. ( ④ ) These 
insects are always present, since the tropical forest never has 
a frost that will terminate them. ( ⑤ ) The highlands also have 
a long enough growing season for two crops a year.

Participating in extracurricular activities is a very good thing, 
but some people don’t know where to draw the line. The result? 
Joining too many clubs can reduce a large amount of your free 
time. This is especially true during certain crunch times. For 
example, if you work for a school newspaper and your deadline 
is approaching, you know that you might have to spend evenings 
and even weekends making sure the paper is as perfect as you 
want it to be. Pacing is important. The point is this: If you don’t 
exercise some moderation in terms of your extracurricular 
activities, you can become awfully stressed out about the tasks 
you absolutely need to complete. So get involved in the activities 
that are most meaningful to you, and make sure you don’t 
overextend yourself.

In 1990, Elizabeth Newton, a psychologist, studied a simple 
game in which she assigned people to one of two roles ―  
‘tappers’ or ‘listeners.’ Tappers received a list of well known 
songs such as ‘Happy Birthday to You.’ Each tapper was 
asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a listener. 
The listener’s job was to guess the song, based on the 
rhythm being tapped. Before the listeners guessed the song, 
the tappers predicted the listeners would guess 50 percent 
of the songs correctly. But the result was that listeners 
guessed only 2.5 percent of the songs. Why? When a tapper 
tapped, she was hearing the song in her head. Meanwhile, 
the listeners couldn’t hear the tune ― all they could hear 
was a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind of bizarre 
Morse Code. That is, the tappers couldn’t understand the 
position of the listeners who didn’t know the song title.
