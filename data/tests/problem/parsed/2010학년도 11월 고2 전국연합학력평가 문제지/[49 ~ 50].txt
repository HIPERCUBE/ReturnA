The rise of social media sites like Facebook, MySpace and 
Flikr, has been accompanied by fears that we are producing 
the most narcissistic generation in history. But is there any 
actual scientific evidence for that view? A study of 14,000 
college students between 1979 and 2009 was presented this 
weekend at the annual meeting of Association for 
Psychological Science. The research found today’s young 
people are 40 percent less                        than college 
students from 30 years ago in their real lives, not the virtual 
ones. For instance, today’s students are less likely to agree 
with statements like, “I sometimes try to understand my 
friends better by imagining how things look from their 
perspective,” and “I often have tender and concerned feelings 
for people who are less fortunate than me.”
According to one of the lead researchers, Ed O’Brien, “It’s 
harder for today’s college students to share their emotions 
with others because so much of their social lives is done 
through a computer and not through real life interaction.” He 
also notes that students are facing increasing competition, so 
they’re spending much more time working on their grades and 
resumés, instead of socializing.
