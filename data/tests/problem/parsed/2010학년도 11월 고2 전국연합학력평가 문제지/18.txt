Five thousand years ago, the craters of extinct volcanoes in 
Arabia were used as this by farmers for their irrigation water. 
Dry climate and water shortage in India led to early 
development of water management techniques, including the 
building of this in 3,000 BC. This may be created in river 
valleys by the construction of a dam or may be built by 
conventional construction techniques, like brickwork. This is 
used to provide raw water feed to a water treatment plant 
which delivers drinking water through water mains. This does 
not simply hold water until it is needed; it can also be the first 
part of the water treatment process.
