19.  밑줄 친 he[him]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? [1점]
I have been married to Mick for 22 years. My problem is that I 
have sometimes had a hard time contacting him. He is so 
forgetful that ① he often doesn’t know where he put his cell 
phone. Recently, our family planned to go to dinner. When Mick 
didn’t show up, we tried to contact ② him for one hour. We 
were worried sick, so we called Bill, one of his friends. We 
expected ③ him to know my husband’s whereabouts, but he was 
no help to us. One hour later, Mick came back home and 
apologetically said that ④ he seemed to have left his cell phone 
beneath the pillow on our bed. At that very moment, his cell 
phone began vibrating in the pocket of the coat ⑤ he was 
wearing!
