33.  If you are the owner of a digital camera and have kids, you 
should be taking pictures of them at least a couple of times a 
month while theyâ€™re young. The first advantage of doing this is 
that if you constantly take pictures of your children, they will 
surely feel loved and adored by you, their parents. They might 
even end up doing the same for their kids. Secondly, if at any 
point in the future you feel like looking back at things that 
happened, having photos of your kids will definitely help remind 
you of many things. Lastly, if ever in life there is an emergency 
such as a lost child or you for some reason need pictures of 
your kids, then you will have many available if you start to take 
pictures of them now.
