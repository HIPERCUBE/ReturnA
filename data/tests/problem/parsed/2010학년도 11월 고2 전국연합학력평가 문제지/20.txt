My younger brother, Martin, has a chance for a marvelous job 
next year on condition that he speaks English fluently. As he 
has never studied it at all, however, he must learn it very 
quickly. What is the best way of doing this? Should he try to do 
it on his own with the help of records or CDs or should he go to 
a local language school where the teachers are all American? It 
is an awful nuisance to be bothered with all these questions, I 
know, but as you are a teacher of English to foreigners you are 
the person most qualified to help us find appropriate ways to 
study English. Martin joins me in apologizing for troubling you, 
and we both send you our best wishes.
