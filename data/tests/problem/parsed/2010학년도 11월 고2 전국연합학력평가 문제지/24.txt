24.  In 2003, there was one car line that sold more than any other 
in the U.S. Ironically, it had previously proven itself to be an 
ineffective profit­maker for the manufacturer. Why did its sales 
skyrocket all of a sudden? It couldn’t have been driven by 
advertising. Nor was there any price change to account for the 
unexpected popularity. The reason for its success was 
paradoxical: Its manufacturer had decided to discontinue the line 
due to poor sales. In response to the announcement that the car 
line would soon no longer be available, sales jumped like never 
before. Why? The answer lies in the                 principle: 
People show a greater desire for an object when they learn that 
it is unique, available in limited quantities, or obtainable for 
only a limited time.
