The underlying idea of world history is that the interaction 
among human societies resembles not the relationships 
among billiard balls, but rather among bacteria.
(A) Similarly, human societies in contact affect each other’s 
development. World historians, recognizing this, seek 
to understand human history through studying both 
developments within societies and the way in which 
societies relate to each other.
(B) Bacteria, however, fundamentally shape each other as 
they interact. Because the membranes covering bacteria 
are full of pores, bacteria can exchange genetic 
information and can even fundamentally alter each 
other’s basic make-up when they touch.
(C) Billiard balls rolling around the table may collide and 
affect each other’s trajectories, but they do not actually 
change each other: The eight ball is an eight ball even 
after it is struck by the cue ball.
