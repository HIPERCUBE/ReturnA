(A)
The first memory I have of visiting a working artist’s 
studio is a trip my family took to the studio of (a) Grey 
Stone, a potter who made the dinnerware set our whole 
family has cherished for many years. When I was about 
five years old, our family drove down to his studio 
with several miscellaneous pieces of handmade pottery 
from the family collection. We wanted Grey to make a 
set that would draw together the pieces we had collected 
over the years.
(B)
A favorite family pastime then developed when guests 
came over and we got out the “good stoneware.” Before 
my father served the food, (b) he would encourage 
guests to flip over their plates to read what was on the 
underside. Thanks to his influence, this childhood pastime 
has since become a habit. Even today, I still flip over 
all handmade pottery pieces as soon as I first touch 
them to see if there might be an inscription or at least 
to look for the potter’s mark.
(C)
Even at that young age, looking around Grey’s house 
and studio complex, I thought about how great it was that 
he could work at home, with (c) his family around him, 
and produce things with his own hands. After accepting 
our request, he immediately started working on one of the 
pieces. Taking a prepared lump of clay, (d) he put it on 
his treadle wheel. It was so fascinating to see how 
ordinary clay could turn into a beautiful pot.
(D)
I couldn’t get that process out of my head so I looked 
forward to our return trip several months later to pick up 
the finished dinnerware. One of my favorite features of 
each piece Grey had made was that, upon close 
inspection, one could see that the pieces had been 
individually inscribed with some marks on the underside, 
just inside the trimmed foot. On each of those pieces, 
with the large foot area, there was room for the 
inscription not only of (e) the potter’s signature, address, 
and date, but also a unique saying or phrase.
