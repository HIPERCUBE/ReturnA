25. Imagine a child playing on the beach below a cliff. He finds 
a cave, and full of excitement, goes in. Suddenly fear seizes 
him. In the deep dark of the cave, he cannot see the way ahead. 
What is frightening him is the sense of the unknown stretching 
into the black distance. Worries can be like this. Our anxiety 
is not about something specific, but more of a sense that 
unknown and uncertain possibilities may be out of sight far 
ahead. We can stop these worries from growing. A powerful 
torch or flashlight could have shown the child the limits of 
the cave. We can  by 
asking: “What is the worst that can happen?” More often than 
not, the worst that we fear is much less terrible than our vague, 
unarticulated fear. Once we know the worst, we can face it 
directly and work out more sensibly what to do.
① hide our fears
② increase our uncertainties
③ place limits on our worries
④ share specific worries with others
⑤ differentiate reality from the ideal
