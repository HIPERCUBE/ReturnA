22. To require perfection is to invite paralysis. The pattern 
is predictable: as you see error in what you have done, you 
steer your work toward what you imagine you can do 
perfectly. You cling ever more tightly to what you already 
know you can do ― away from risk and exploration, and 
possibly further from the work of your heart. You find 
reasons to delay, since to not work is to not make mistakes. 
Believing that your work should be perfect, you gradually 
become convinced that you cannot do it. (You are correct.) 
Sooner or later, since you cannot do what you are trying to 
do, you quit. And in one of those little ironies of life, only 
the pattern itself achieves perfection ― a perfect death spiral: 
you misdirect your work; you stall; you quit.
