24. The sun is slowly getting brighter as its core contracts and 
heats up. In a billion years it will be about 10 percent brighter 
than today, heating the planet to an uncomfortable degree. 
Water evaporating from the oceans may set off a runaway 
greenhouse effect that turns Earth into a damp version of 
Venus, wrapped permanently in a thick, white blanket of cloud. 
Or the transformation may take some time and be more gentle, 
with an increasingly hot and cloudy atmosphere able to shelter 
microbial life for some time. Either way, water will escape into 
the stratosphere and be broken down by UV light into oxygen 
and hydrogen. Oxygen will be left in the stratosphere ― 
perhaps misleading aliens into thinking the planet is still 
inhabited ― while the hydrogen is light enough to escape into 
space. So our water will gradually .
