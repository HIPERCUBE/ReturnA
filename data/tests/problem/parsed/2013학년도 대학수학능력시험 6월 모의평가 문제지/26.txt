26. People have found many ways to reduce stress or control 
their responses to it. Possibilities include special breathing 
routines, exercise, meditation, and distraction, as well as 
trying to deal with the problem that caused the stress. 
Social support is one of the most powerful methods of 
coping with stress, and researchers have demonstrated its 
effectiveness by brain measurements as well as people’s 
self-reports. In one study, happily married women were 
given moderately painful shocks to their ankles. On various 
trials, they held the hand of their husband, a man they did 
not know, or no one. Holding the husband’s hand reduced 
the response in several brain areas. Holding the hand of an 
unknown man reduced the response a little, on the average, 
but not as much as holding the husband’s hand. In short, as 
expected, brain responses correspond to people’s self-reports 
that .
① holding hands makes them feel friendlier
② exercise and meditation lessen ankle pain
③ stimulating the brain induces happier feelings
④ what matters the most is how to measure stress
⑤ social support from a loved one helps reduce stress
