28. Essentially the same structural forms of politics can 
nevertheless take on very different “flavors.” For example, 
a dictatorship can, in theory, be brutal or benevolent; 
anarchy can, in theory, consist of “mutual aid” or a “war 
of all against all” that proceeds in the absence of any rule 
of law whatsoever; democracies can and typically are 
distinguished in terms of the extent to which they are 
socially oriented as opposed to individualistically oriented. 
Thus, whatever our answer to the “What is the best 
structural form of politics?” question, we still want to know 
what “flavor” this structural form of politics ought to have 
since . Indeed, 
this is precisely why we vote within a democratic structure: to 
determine the “flavor” we want that democratic structure to 
have. [3점]
① voters ultimately determine a political structure
② political structures, in fact, outweigh political “flavors”
③ the best structural form of politics is not easy to determine
④ political structure, by itself, does not determine political content
⑤ each structural form of politics must be valued independently
