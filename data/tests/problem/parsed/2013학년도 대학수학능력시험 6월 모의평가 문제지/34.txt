34. Ancient Greek and Roman costume is essentially draped, 
and presents a traditional stability and permanence. While it 
received certain fashions over the centuries, it never 
underwent any major transformation. Léon Heuzey, the 
pioneer of the study of classical costume, set forth with 
exemplary clarity its two basic principles: the first is that 
Classical costume has no form in itself, as it consisted of 
a simple rectangular piece of cloth woven in varying sizes 
according to its intended use and the height of the customer, 
without differentiation between the sexes; the second is that 
this cloth is always draped, never shaped or cut, and was 
worn round the body in accordance with definite rules. Thus 
it was always fluid and ‘live.’ It is notable that we find no 
evidence in Classical times of tailors or dressmakers: the 
word itself barely exists in Greek or Latin.
