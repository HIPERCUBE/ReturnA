I have always been a huge fan of Redbug Cameras. 
However, when I purchased your newest model, the 
Superimage 2000, I could not have been more disappointed. 
I acquired it on June 3rd of this year and it does not 
function correctly. The camera lens does not focus properly 
and the resulting photos are blurry and unclear. I went to the 
local service center to get it repaired, but the poor service 
I received there only complicated the problem. I am 
extremely frustrated with the poor quality repairs that were 
made in addition to the overall inferior quality of the 
camera. I insist on receiving a full refund. Enclosed is a 
copy of the original receipt and the repair bill.
