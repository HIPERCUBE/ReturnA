The small jerboa lives in deserts across the world. Jerboas 
have big eyes and, like many desert animals, they can see 
very well at night. In the late evening, they come out of 
their holes and look for food ― mostly seeds and plants. 
Jerboas are very well adapted to life in the desert. Some 
jerboas do not need to drink, because they get water from 
their food. In the hot summer, some jerboas sleep under the 
sand for two or three months. Jerboas also live in cold 
deserts like the Gobi. Here, they sleep in their holes in the 
winter and stay away from the snow. Jerboas can move 
very fast across the sand. They have huge back legs and 
they can jump up to three meters in one move. They do 
this when they need to run away from other animals.
