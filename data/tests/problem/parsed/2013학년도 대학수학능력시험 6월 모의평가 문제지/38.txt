I am a female dolphin who lives in an aquarium. One day 
I got so badly injured that I couldn’t swim and come up for 
air. So my trainers attached bottles to me to act as floats. 
I didn’t want to live the rest of my life being supported by 
these bottles. I was so aimless and dispirited. I merely 
floated about and was sure I wasn’t going to live for very 
long. Seeing my depression, my trainers brought in a male 
dolphin. At first I ignored him but later began to show 
interest. He tried to help me swim, pushing me from under 
and bringing me to the surface. Despite my injury, I began 
making an effort to swim. Soon, the bottles were removed 
and I recovered completely. It felt great to swim on my 
own again. We became inseparable, swimming joyfully 
around together and showing signs of affection.
