In one troop, a taste for caramels was developed by 
introducing this new food into the diet of young minors, 
low on the status ladder.
We are not the only species to give sometimes wrongheaded 
deference to those in authority positions. ( ① ) In monkey 
colonies, where rigid dominance hierarchies exist, beneficial 
innovations do not spread quickly through the group unless 
they are taught first to a dominant animal. ( ② ) When a 
lower animal is taught the new concept first, the rest of the 
colony remains mostly oblivious to its value. ( ③ ) One 
study on the introduction of new food tastes to Japanese 
monkeys provides a nice illustration. ( ④ ) The taste for 
caramels inched slowly up the ranks: A year and a half later, 
only 51 percent of the colony had acquired it, and still none 
of the leaders. ( ⑤ ) Contrast this with what happened in a 
second troop where wheat was introduced first to the leader: 
Wheat eating ― to this point unknown to these monkeys ―
spread through the whole colony within four hours.
