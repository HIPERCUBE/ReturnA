I have always been a huge fan of Redbug Cameras. 
However, when I purchased your newest model, the 
Superimage 2000, I could not have been more disappointed. 
I acquired it on June 3rd of this year and it does not 
function correctly. The camera lens does not focus properly 
and the resulting photos are blurry and unclear. I went to the 
local service center to get it repaired, but the poor service 
I received there only complicated the problem. I am 
extremely frustrated with the poor quality repairs that were 
made in addition to the overall inferior quality of the 
camera. I insist on receiving a full refund. Enclosed is a 
copy of the original receipt and the repair bill.

19. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Henri Matisse came late to painting, having trained to be 
a lawyer to please his father. While he was in the hospital 
recovering from surgery, his mother brought ① him a box 
of paints and a how-to book, and the world lost an attorney 
and gained an artist. “It was as if ② I had been called,” he 
remembered. “Henceforth I did not lead my life. It led me.” 
Matisse left for Paris to study art, with his father shouting, 
“Do you want ③ me to see you starve?” He gained fame 
as leader of the Fauves’ 1905 show. In 1917 Matisse began 
to spend winters in Vence, where he donated a chapel of 
④ his own design that is one of the most moving religious 
buildings in Europe. After local nuns nursed ⑤ him through 
a serious illness in the 1940s, the grateful Matisse devoted 
himself to every detail of the chapel.

Deseada is a small island which belongs to the Lesser 
Antilles. This island is said to have obtained its name 
from the desire Christopher Columbus felt of seeing land 
on his second voyage in 1493. It is twelve miles in length 
and six miles in width. The part which looks to the north 
is lower than (A) it / that  which looks to the south. The 
island abounds greatly in iguanas, and in a species of 
birds called fragatas. There is a deep cavern on the 
island, containing the bones and arms of the Indians, 
who, it is supposed, (B) was / were buried there. In 1762, 
this island was taken by the English, (C) who / where  
restored it the following year to the French by the Peace of 
Paris, and since that time it has been in the possession 
of the latter.

③ that …… was …… who
④ that …… were …… who
⑤ that …… were …… where
21. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
If you’ve ever gone snorkeling, you may ① have seen an 
amazing sight: an entire school of fish suddenly changes 
direction as one unit. The same goes for flocks of birds. So 
are they all following the commands of a leader? Researchers 
have determined that there is no leader or controlling force. 
Rather, the individual fish or bird is reacting ② almost 
instantly to the movements of its neighbors in the school or 
flock. ③ Any individual can initiate a movement, such as a 
change in direction, and this sends out a “maneuver wave,” 
which spreads through the group at an astounding speed. 
Because individuals can see, or sense, the wave ④ coming 
toward them, they are ready to react more quickly than they 
would without such advance notice. ⑤ That appears to us as 
simultaneous is actually a kind of “follow your neighbor” 
behavior moving faster than the eye can see.
* maneuver: 움직임
[22～23] 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
22. To require perfection is to invite paralysis. The pattern 
is predictable: as you see error in what you have done, you 
steer your work toward what you imagine you can do 
perfectly. You cling ever more tightly to what you already 
know you can do ― away from risk and exploration, and 
possibly further from the work of your heart. You find 
reasons to delay, since to not work is to not make mistakes. 
Believing that your work should be perfect, you gradually 
become convinced that you cannot do it. (You are correct.) 
Sooner or later, since you cannot do what you are trying to 
do, you quit. And in one of those little ironies of life, only 
the pattern itself achieves perfection ― a perfect death spiral: 
you misdirect your work; you stall; you quit.
① 지나친 모험심을 멀리해야 한다.
② 완벽에 집착하면 일을 그르친다.
③ 기존 방식에서도 배울 점이 있다.
④ 처음부터 완벽한 계획을 세워야 한다. 
⑤ 서두르지 않아야 실수를 줄일 수 있다.
23. A man standing on the street corner selling “nonbreakable” 
pens suddenly finds that the one he is demonstrating with 
breaks in half. He stops for a moment, turns to the crowd, 
and declares, “Now I’ll show you what the inside looks 
like.” Laughter can turn any disadvantage into an advantage. 
People who know this not only look for some positive aspect 
in their misfortunes but actually go one step further. After 
their initial shock, they gather their resources, overcome their 
problem, and see opportunities where most of us fail to see 
them. Moreover, many who have experienced a major loss 
often go on to achieve remarkable feats in spite of their 
hardships, because they focus on what they can gain from 
their circumstance rather than on what they have lost. They 
believe in the old cliché that every cloud has a silver lining, 
and they actively seek the advantage in their disadvantage.
① 유머로 대인 관계를 개선하라.
② 자신의 약점을 인식하라.
③ 허황된 꿈을 꾸지 마라.
④ 위기를 기회로 만들어라.
⑤ 사소한 이익에 연연하지 마라.

24. The sun is slowly getting brighter as its core contracts and 
heats up. In a billion years it will be about 10 percent brighter 
than today, heating the planet to an uncomfortable degree. 
Water evaporating from the oceans may set off a runaway 
greenhouse effect that turns Earth into a damp version of 
Venus, wrapped permanently in a thick, white blanket of cloud. 
Or the transformation may take some time and be more gentle, 
with an increasingly hot and cloudy atmosphere able to shelter 
microbial life for some time. Either way, water will escape into 
the stratosphere and be broken down by UV light into oxygen 
and hydrogen. Oxygen will be left in the stratosphere ― 
perhaps misleading aliens into thinking the planet is still 
inhabited ― while the hydrogen is light enough to escape into 
space. So our water will gradually .

① leak away ② be frozen ③ flow over
④ get polluted ⑤ accumulate
25. Imagine a child playing on the beach below a cliff. He finds 
a cave, and full of excitement, goes in. Suddenly fear seizes 
him. In the deep dark of the cave, he cannot see the way ahead. 
What is frightening him is the sense of the unknown stretching 
into the black distance. Worries can be like this. Our anxiety 
is not about something specific, but more of a sense that 
unknown and uncertain possibilities may be out of sight far 
ahead. We can stop these worries from growing. A powerful 
torch or flashlight could have shown the child the limits of 
the cave. We can  by 
asking: “What is the worst that can happen?” More often than 
not, the worst that we fear is much less terrible than our vague, 
unarticulated fear. Once we know the worst, we can face it 
directly and work out more sensibly what to do.
① hide our fears
② increase our uncertainties
③ place limits on our worries
④ share specific worries with others
⑤ differentiate reality from the ideal
26. People have found many ways to reduce stress or control 
their responses to it. Possibilities include special breathing 
routines, exercise, meditation, and distraction, as well as 
trying to deal with the problem that caused the stress. 
Social support is one of the most powerful methods of 
coping with stress, and researchers have demonstrated its 
effectiveness by brain measurements as well as people’s 
self-reports. In one study, happily married women were 
given moderately painful shocks to their ankles. On various 
trials, they held the hand of their husband, a man they did 
not know, or no one. Holding the husband’s hand reduced 
the response in several brain areas. Holding the hand of an 
unknown man reduced the response a little, on the average, 
but not as much as holding the husband’s hand. In short, as 
expected, brain responses correspond to people’s self-reports 
that .
① holding hands makes them feel friendlier
② exercise and meditation lessen ankle pain
③ stimulating the brain induces happier feelings
④ what matters the most is how to measure stress
⑤ social support from a loved one helps reduce stress
27. Lifeline infrastructures are vital systems that support a 
nation’s economy and quality of life. Modern economies 
rely on the ability to move goods, people, and information 
safely and reliably. Adding to their importance is that 
many of the lifeline systems serve vital roles in disaster 
recovery. Consequently, it is of the utmost importance to 
government, business, and the public at large that the 
flow of services provided by a nation’s infrastructure 
continues unimpeded in the face of a broad range of 
natural and technological hazards. The linkage between 
systems and services is critical to any discussion of 
infrastructure. Although it is the performance of the 
hardware (i.e., the highways, pipes, and transmission lines) 
that is of immediate concern following an earthquake, it 
is actually the loss of services that these systems provide 
that is the real loss to the public. Therefore, a high 
priority in protecting these systems from hazards is 
ensuring ___________________________________.
① an early alarm system for economic crises
② the durability and stability of transmission lines
③ the continuity, or at least the rapid restoration, of service
④ a prompt mobilization of experts for disaster control
⑤ the maintenance and expansion of lifeline systems
28. Essentially the same structural forms of politics can 
nevertheless take on very different “flavors.” For example, 
a dictatorship can, in theory, be brutal or benevolent; 
anarchy can, in theory, consist of “mutual aid” or a “war 
of all against all” that proceeds in the absence of any rule 
of law whatsoever; democracies can and typically are 
distinguished in terms of the extent to which they are 
socially oriented as opposed to individualistically oriented. 
Thus, whatever our answer to the “What is the best 
structural form of politics?” question, we still want to know 
what “flavor” this structural form of politics ought to have 
since . Indeed, 
this is precisely why we vote within a democratic structure: to 
determine the “flavor” we want that democratic structure to 
have. [3점]
① voters ultimately determine a political structure
② political structures, in fact, outweigh political “flavors”
③ the best structural form of politics is not easy to determine
④ political structure, by itself, does not determine political content
⑤ each structural form of politics must be valued independently

것을 고르시오.
29. The greatest errors in judging a person are made by his 
parents; this is a fact, but how is one to explain it? Do the 
parents have too much experience of the child, and can they 
no longer compose it into a unity? We notice that travelers 
in a strange land grasp correctly the common, distinctive 
traits of a people only in the first period of their stay; the 
more they get to know a people, the more they (A) 
how to see what is typical and distinctive about it. As soon 
as they see up close, they stop being farsighted. Might 
parents judge their children wrongly because they have 
never stood far enough off from them? A quite different 
explanation would be the following: people tend to stop 
thinking about things that are closest to them, and simply
(B) them. When parents are required to judge their 
children, it is perhaps their customary thoughtlessness that 
makes them judge so mistakenly. [3점]
(A) (B)
① forget …… accept
② learn …… ignore
③ seek …… conceal
④ neglect …… analyze
⑤ understand …… embrace
30. Persuasion is the strategic use of language to move an 
audience. It works by appealing to our emotion as well as 
by appealing to our reason. Therefore, sometimes you 
may try to appeal to an emotion in your audience by 
imitating it: hysteria by being hysterical, anger by raging. 
(A) , you may try to re-create the circumstances 
which excited in you the emotions that you want to excite in 
your audience. However, the best measure is to appear calm, 
detached, thoroughly in control of your feelings, while 
you are controlling your narrative for your own purposes. 
Even your choice of words should be selective; you must pay 
attention to their nuances. If you address a labor union,
(B) , it will make a great difference whether you 
refer to the members as workers, comrades, or just people.
(A) (B)
① In short …… in addition
② By contrast …… in addition
③ Hence …… however
④ Nevertheless …… for example
⑤ Also …… for example
36. Patience Lovell Wright에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Patience Lovell Wright was a successful artist who specialized 
in creating wax figures of famous people. Although Patience 
had received little formal education and what she knew 
about art was mostly self-taught, she was very skilled, and 
her work quickly became popular. She was also a devoted 
Patriot. When the war broke out, she immediately began to 
work for the Continental Army. She easily picked up 
information not only from her clients but also from women 
with whom she socialized often. Patience thrived on danger. 
Toward the end of the American Revolution, she became 
deeply involved in a plot to overthrow the king. Without 
financial backing, the plotters were forced to abandon their 
plan. Patience consoled herself by recognizing the part she 
had played in the American Revolution as one of the 
Patriots’ most colorful spies.

37. jerboa에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The small jerboa lives in deserts across the world. Jerboas 
have big eyes and, like many desert animals, they can see 
very well at night. In the late evening, they come out of 
their holes and look for food ― mostly seeds and plants. 
Jerboas are very well adapted to life in the desert. Some 
jerboas do not need to drink, because they get water from 
their food. In the hot summer, some jerboas sleep under the 
sand for two or three months. Jerboas also live in cold 
deserts like the Gobi. Here, they sleep in their holes in the 
winter and stay away from the snow. Jerboas can move 
very fast across the sand. They have huge back legs and 
they can jump up to three meters in one move. They do 
this when they need to run away from other animals.

38. 다음 글에서 ‘I’가 겪은 심경의 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
I am a female dolphin who lives in an aquarium. One day 
I got so badly injured that I couldn’t swim and come up for 
air. So my trainers attached bottles to me to act as floats. 
I didn’t want to live the rest of my life being supported by 
these bottles. I was so aimless and dispirited. I merely 
floated about and was sure I wasn’t going to live for very 
long. Seeing my depression, my trainers brought in a male 
dolphin. At first I ignored him but later began to show 
interest. He tried to help me swim, pushing me from under 
and bringing me to the surface. Despite my injury, I began 
making an effort to swim. Soon, the bottles were removed 
and I recovered completely. It felt great to swim on my 
own again. We became inseparable, swimming joyfully 
around together and showing signs of affection.
① hopeless → happy
② satisfied → worried
③ confused → envious
④ alarmed → regretful
⑤ nervous → disheartened

39. The streets of New York are home to numerous trucks, 
vans, stands, and pushcarts all selling food. Most of the 
vendors are immigrants bringing street versions of the 
world’s diverse food traditions to this already international 
metropolis. You can snack on Jamaican goat patties, sample 
Chinese noodles, take a bite of Egyptian falafel, or enjoy 
vegetarian Sri Lankan curry. New York even has an annual 
award ceremony, the Vendy Awards, for the best sidewalk 
chefs. Part of the fun is tracking down the best offerings. 
Trucks and vans often visit different areas of New York on 
different days; some chefs operate only at certain times of 
day or only on weekends. Even stands with regular spots and 
hours occasionally vanish, as the owner finds a better spot 
or takes a week off. Follow the crowds, or ask locals for 
information ― hotel doormen will often let you into the 
secrets of a neighborhood’s best vendors.

40. Fourteenth-century approaches to music had a profound 
and continuing impact on music in later centuries. Perhaps 
most significant was the invention of a precise and 
unambiguous notation that could record a wide variety of 
rhythms and allowed music to be distributed in writing and 
performed accurately wherever it went. We now take this 
for granted when we play from notation and sight-read through 
unfamiliar music, but it was a remarkable innovation in the 
fourteenth century. Among its effects was that composers 
could fix their music exactly as they wished it to be 
performed, leading them to take pride in authorship. The 
increased interest in the individual and in satisfying the 
human senses that was characteristic of the age grew 
stronger in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and has 
remained important ever since.

41. According to sociologists, one of the most widespread and 
basic norms of human culture is embodied in the rule for 
reciprocation. ① The rule requires that one person try to 
repay, in kind, what another person has provided. ② By 
obligating the recipient of an act to repayment in the future, 
the rule for reciprocation allows one individual to give 
something to another with confidence that it is not being lost.
③ Sociologists have a desire to be consistent with their 
words, beliefs, attitudes, and deeds. ④ This sense of future 
obligation within the rule makes possible the development 
of various kinds of continuing relationships, transactions, and 
exchanges that are beneficial to the society. ⑤ Consequently, 
all members of the society are trained from childhood to 
follow the rule or suffer serious social disapproval.
* reciprocation: 보답
42. Several plane crashes and near crashes have been attributed 
to dangerous downward wind bursts known as wind shear. 
These wind bursts generally result from high-speed downdrafts 
in the turbulence of thunderstorms, but they can occur in 
clear air when rain evaporates high above the ground. ①The 
downdraft spreads out when it hits the ground and forms an 
inward circular pattern. ② A plane entering the pattern 
experiences an unexpected upward headwind that lifts the 
plane. ③ Special radar systems are being installed at major 
airports to detect the location of unpredictable thunderstorms. 
④ To resist it, the pilot often cuts speed and lowers the 
plane’s nose to compensate. ⑤ Further into the circular 
pattern, the wind quickly turns downward, and an airplane 
can suddenly lose altitude and possibly crash when it is near 
the ground, as upon landing.
* wind shear: 갑자기 방향이 바뀌는 돌풍

The underlying idea of world history is that the interaction 
among human societies resembles not the relationships 
among billiard balls, but rather among bacteria.
(A) Similarly, human societies in contact affect each other’s 
development. World historians, recognizing this, seek 
to understand human history through studying both 
developments within societies and the way in which 
societies relate to each other.
(B) Bacteria, however, fundamentally shape each other as 
they interact. Because the membranes covering bacteria 
are full of pores, bacteria can exchange genetic 
information and can even fundamentally alter each 
other’s basic make-up when they touch.
(C) Billiard balls rolling around the table may collide and 
affect each other’s trajectories, but they do not actually 
change each other: The eight ball is an eight ball even 
after it is struck by the cue ball.

In one troop, a taste for caramels was developed by 
introducing this new food into the diet of young minors, 
low on the status ladder.
We are not the only species to give sometimes wrongheaded 
deference to those in authority positions. ( ① ) In monkey 
colonies, where rigid dominance hierarchies exist, beneficial 
innovations do not spread quickly through the group unless 
they are taught first to a dominant animal. ( ② ) When a 
lower animal is taught the new concept first, the rest of the 
colony remains mostly oblivious to its value. ( ③ ) One 
study on the introduction of new food tastes to Japanese 
monkeys provides a nice illustration. ( ④ ) The taste for 
caramels inched slowly up the ranks: A year and a half later, 
only 51 percent of the colony had acquired it, and still none 
of the leaders. ( ⑤ ) Contrast this with what happened in a 
second troop where wheat was introduced first to the leader: 
Wheat eating ― to this point unknown to these monkeys ―
spread through the whole colony within four hours.
* deference: 복종  ** oblivious: 알아차리지 못하는

All art is creation, regardless of how closely the 
imitation approximates the original. Even the most 
rigorous attempt to create an absolute likeness is 
ultimately selective. Doing a portrait, for example, the 
artist may ask the subject to look serious, not smile ― 
selecting a certain aspect of the person. We know Mona 
Lisa Giaconda, the subject of the most famous portrait 
in the world, through her mysterious smile; but we will 
never know what the entire person was like. The 
treasure of art, however, is that its reality lives forever. 
The final product is really an addition to reality, not 
simply a way of totally reproducing it. The artist always 
contributes something new, something that never was 
put together in precisely that way before. Leonardo’s 
Mona Lisa is not Mona Lisa. The latter has long since 
gone to her reward; the former will never die.

(A)
The first memory I have of visiting a working artist’s 
studio is a trip my family took to the studio of (a) Grey 
Stone, a potter who made the dinnerware set our whole 
family has cherished for many years. When I was about 
five years old, our family drove down to his studio 
with several miscellaneous pieces of handmade pottery 
from the family collection. We wanted Grey to make a 
set that would draw together the pieces we had collected 
over the years.
(B)
A favorite family pastime then developed when guests 
came over and we got out the “good stoneware.” Before 
my father served the food, (b) he would encourage 
guests to flip over their plates to read what was on the 
underside. Thanks to his influence, this childhood pastime 
has since become a habit. Even today, I still flip over 
all handmade pottery pieces as soon as I first touch 
them to see if there might be an inscription or at least 
to look for the potter’s mark.
(C)
Even at that young age, looking around Grey’s house 
and studio complex, I thought about how great it was that 
he could work at home, with (c) his family around him, 
and produce things with his own hands. After accepting 
our request, he immediately started working on one of the 
pieces. Taking a prepared lump of clay, (d) he put it on 
his treadle wheel. It was so fascinating to see how 
ordinary clay could turn into a beautiful pot.
(D)
I couldn’t get that process out of my head so I looked 
forward to our return trip several months later to pick up 
the finished dinnerware. One of my favorite features of 
each piece Grey had made was that, upon close 
inspection, one could see that the pieces had been 
individually inscribed with some marks on the underside, 
just inside the trimmed foot. On each of those pieces, 
with the large foot area, there was room for the 
inscription not only of (e) the potter’s signature, address, 
and date, but also a unique saying or phrase.

All his life, Chris Greicius dreamed of becoming a 
police officer. But there was a major obstacle standing 
in his way. He had leukemia and was not expected to 
make it to adulthood. When he was seven years old, 
Chris’s disease got worse. That’s when a family friend, 
Tommy Austin, arranged for Chris to come as close as 
he could to . He called 
Officer Ron Cox and arranged for Chris to spend a day 
with some police officers.
When the day arrived, Chris was welcomed by three 
squad cars and a police motorcycle ridden by Officer 
Frank Shankwitz. Then, he was treated to a ride in a 
police helicopter. The officers finished the day by 
swearing Chris in as the first ― and only ― honorary 
state trooper. The next day, Cox presented Chris with an 
official Arizona Highway Patrol uniform. With a smile 
that lit up the room, he accepted it.
Two days later, Chris died in the hospital, his uniform 
close at hand. Shankwitz was very sad, but grateful that 
he had helped Chris. He also realized that there were 
many other children like Chris. That prompted Shankwitz 
to co-found the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It has now 
become the largest wish-granting organization in the world, 
enlarging the experiences of more than eighty thousand 
children.
