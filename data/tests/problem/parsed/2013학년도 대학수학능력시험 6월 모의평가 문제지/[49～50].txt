All his life, Chris Greicius dreamed of becoming a 
police officer. But there was a major obstacle standing 
in his way. He had leukemia and was not expected to 
make it to adulthood. When he was seven years old, 
Chris’s disease got worse. That’s when a family friend, 
Tommy Austin, arranged for Chris to come as close as 
he could to . He called 
Officer Ron Cox and arranged for Chris to spend a day 
with some police officers.
When the day arrived, Chris was welcomed by three 
squad cars and a police motorcycle ridden by Officer 
Frank Shankwitz. Then, he was treated to a ride in a 
police helicopter. The officers finished the day by 
swearing Chris in as the first ― and only ― honorary 
state trooper. The next day, Cox presented Chris with an 
official Arizona Highway Patrol uniform. With a smile 
that lit up the room, he accepted it.
Two days later, Chris died in the hospital, his uniform 
close at hand. Shankwitz was very sad, but grateful that 
he had helped Chris. He also realized that there were 
many other children like Chris. That prompted Shankwitz 
to co-found the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It has now 
become the largest wish-granting organization in the world, 
enlarging the experiences of more than eighty thousand 
children.
