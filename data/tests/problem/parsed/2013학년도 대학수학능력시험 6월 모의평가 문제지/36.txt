36. Patience Lovell Wright에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Patience Lovell Wright was a successful artist who specialized 
in creating wax figures of famous people. Although Patience 
had received little formal education and what she knew 
about art was mostly self-taught, she was very skilled, and 
her work quickly became popular. She was also a devoted 
Patriot. When the war broke out, she immediately began to 
work for the Continental Army. She easily picked up 
information not only from her clients but also from women 
with whom she socialized often. Patience thrived on danger. 
Toward the end of the American Revolution, she became 
deeply involved in a plot to overthrow the king. Without 
financial backing, the plotters were forced to abandon their 
plan. Patience consoled herself by recognizing the part she 
had played in the American Revolution as one of the 
Patriots’ most colorful spies.
