Henri Matisse came late to painting, having trained to be 
a lawyer to please his father. While he was in the hospital 
recovering from surgery, his mother brought ① him a box 
of paints and a how-to book, and the world lost an attorney 
and gained an artist. “It was as if ② I had been called,” he 
remembered. “Henceforth I did not lead my life. It led me.” 
Matisse left for Paris to study art, with his father shouting, 
“Do you want ③ me to see you starve?” He gained fame 
as leader of the Fauves’ 1905 show. In 1917 Matisse began 
to spend winters in Vence, where he donated a chapel of 
④ his own design that is one of the most moving religious 
buildings in Europe. After local nuns nursed ⑤ him through 
a serious illness in the 1940s, the grateful Matisse devoted 
himself to every detail of the chapel.
