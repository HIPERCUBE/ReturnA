41. According to sociologists, one of the most widespread and 
basic norms of human culture is embodied in the rule for 
reciprocation. ① The rule requires that one person try to 
repay, in kind, what another person has provided. ② By 
obligating the recipient of an act to repayment in the future, 
the rule for reciprocation allows one individual to give 
something to another with confidence that it is not being lost.
③ Sociologists have a desire to be consistent with their 
words, beliefs, attitudes, and deeds. ④ This sense of future 
obligation within the rule makes possible the development 
of various kinds of continuing relationships, transactions, and 
exchanges that are beneficial to the society. ⑤ Consequently, 
all members of the society are trained from childhood to 
follow the rule or suffer serious social disapproval.
