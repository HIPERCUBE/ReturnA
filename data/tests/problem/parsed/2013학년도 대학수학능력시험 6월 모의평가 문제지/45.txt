All art is creation, regardless of how closely the 
imitation approximates the original. Even the most 
rigorous attempt to create an absolute likeness is 
ultimately selective. Doing a portrait, for example, the 
artist may ask the subject to look serious, not smile ― 
selecting a certain aspect of the person. We know Mona 
Lisa Giaconda, the subject of the most famous portrait 
in the world, through her mysterious smile; but we will 
never know what the entire person was like. The 
treasure of art, however, is that its reality lives forever. 
The final product is really an addition to reality, not 
simply a way of totally reproducing it. The artist always 
contributes something new, something that never was 
put together in precisely that way before. Leonardo’s 
Mona Lisa is not Mona Lisa. The latter has long since 
gone to her reward; the former will never die.

(A)
The first memory I have of visiting a working artist’s 
studio is a trip my family took to the studio of (a) Grey 
Stone, a potter who made the dinnerware set our whole 
family has cherished for many years. When I was about 
five years old, our family drove down to his studio 
with several miscellaneous pieces of handmade pottery 
from the family collection. We wanted Grey to make a 
set that would draw together the pieces we had collected 
over the years.
(B)
A favorite family pastime then developed when guests 
came over and we got out the “good stoneware.” Before 
my father served the food, (b) he would encourage 
guests to flip over their plates to read what was on the 
underside. Thanks to his influence, this childhood pastime 
has since become a habit. Even today, I still flip over 
all handmade pottery pieces as soon as I first touch 
them to see if there might be an inscription or at least 
to look for the potter’s mark.
(C)
Even at that young age, looking around Grey’s house 
and studio complex, I thought about how great it was that 
he could work at home, with (c) his family around him, 
and produce things with his own hands. After accepting 
our request, he immediately started working on one of the 
pieces. Taking a prepared lump of clay, (d) he put it on 
his treadle wheel. It was so fascinating to see how 
ordinary clay could turn into a beautiful pot.
(D)
I couldn’t get that process out of my head so I looked 
forward to our return trip several months later to pick up 
the finished dinnerware. One of my favorite features of 
each piece Grey had made was that, upon close 
inspection, one could see that the pieces had been 
individually inscribed with some marks on the underside, 
just inside the trimmed foot. On each of those pieces, 
with the large foot area, there was room for the 
inscription not only of (e) the potter’s signature, address, 
and date, but also a unique saying or phrase.

All his life, Chris Greicius dreamed of becoming a 
police officer. But there was a major obstacle standing 
in his way. He had leukemia and was not expected to 
make it to adulthood. When he was seven years old, 
Chris’s disease got worse. That’s when a family friend, 
Tommy Austin, arranged for Chris to come as close as 
he could to . He called 
Officer Ron Cox and arranged for Chris to spend a day 
with some police officers.
When the day arrived, Chris was welcomed by three 
squad cars and a police motorcycle ridden by Officer 
Frank Shankwitz. Then, he was treated to a ride in a 
police helicopter. The officers finished the day by 
swearing Chris in as the first ― and only ― honorary 
state trooper. The next day, Cox presented Chris with an 
official Arizona Highway Patrol uniform. With a smile 
that lit up the room, he accepted it.
Two days later, Chris died in the hospital, his uniform 
close at hand. Shankwitz was very sad, but grateful that 
he had helped Chris. He also realized that there were 
many other children like Chris. That prompted Shankwitz 
to co-found the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It has now 
become the largest wish-granting organization in the world, 
enlarging the experiences of more than eighty thousand 
children.
