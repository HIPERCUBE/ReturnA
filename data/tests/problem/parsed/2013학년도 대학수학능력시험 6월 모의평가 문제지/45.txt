All art is creation, regardless of how closely the 
imitation approximates the original. Even the most 
rigorous attempt to create an absolute likeness is 
ultimately selective. Doing a portrait, for example, the 
artist may ask the subject to look serious, not smile ― 
selecting a certain aspect of the person. We know Mona 
Lisa Giaconda, the subject of the most famous portrait 
in the world, through her mysterious smile; but we will 
never know what the entire person was like. The 
treasure of art, however, is that its reality lives forever. 
The final product is really an addition to reality, not 
simply a way of totally reproducing it. The artist always 
contributes something new, something that never was 
put together in precisely that way before. Leonardo’s 
Mona Lisa is not Mona Lisa. The latter has long since 
gone to her reward; the former will never die.
