35. After a stressful day, how do you wind down and clear your 
mind? Relaxing in a comfortable chair, putting on some 
soothing sounds, and reading something light and entertaining 
are all good methods to get ready for some restful sleep. But as 
you ease your exhausted senses, do not forget your sense of 
smell. Certain aromas can fill you with feelings of tranquility, 
and research has found that lavender, vanilla, and green apple 
are among the best smells to help lower anxiety and induce 
sleep. You can use essential oils of these scents by applying 
them to the back of your neck or the inside of your wrist. Even 
better, indulge in a warm bath with these oils dissolved in the 
water. Before bed, you might enjoy a glass of hot soy milk with 
natural vanilla flavoring for a calming effect inside and out.
