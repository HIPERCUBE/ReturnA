24. The wrapping of Christmas presents, William Waits notes, 
is a fairly recent phenomenon in American life. It arose at the 
turn of the 20th century, during a period when hand-made 
presents were giving way to machine-made, store-bought 
ones. For both givers and manufacturers, this shift presented a 
problem, for the machine-made items, precisely because they 
were convenient, represented less of the giver’s personal 
attention than the hand-made items had done; thus they were 
symbolically less intimate. To disguise this loss of symbolic 
value, and to invest the manufactured items with a personal 
touch, retailers encouraged shoppers to have their purchases 
gift-wrapped. Gift-wrapping, in Waits’s acute term, became a 
‘decontaminating mechanism’ that removed the presents from 
the ‘normal flow of bought-and-sold goods’ and made them, 
for a single ceremonial moment, emblems of  rather 
than commerce.
