Since the 1980’s, zoos have strived to reproduce the natural 
habitats of their animals, replacing concrete floors and steel 
bars with grass, rocks, trees, and pools of water. These 
environments may simulate the wild, but the animals do not have 
to worry about finding food, shelter, or safety from predators. 
① While this may not seem like such a bad deal at first glance, 
the animals experience numerous complications. ② And yet, 
most of the complications were settled with no delay in order to 
ensure the animals’ health and safety. ③ The zebras live 
constantly in fear, smelling the lions in the nearby Great Cats 
exhibit every day and finding themselves unable to escape. 
④ There is no possibility of migrating or of storing food for the 
winter, which must seem to promise equally certain doom to a 
bird or bear. ⑤ In short, zoo life is utterly incompatible with an 
animal’s most deeply-rooted survival instincts.
