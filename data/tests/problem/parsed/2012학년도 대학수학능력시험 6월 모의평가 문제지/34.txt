34. While in Japan, I ordered green tea with sugar at a 
restaurant. A waiter politely explained that one does not drink 
green tea with sugar. I responded that I was aware of this 
custom but I liked my tea sweet. The waiter took up the issue 
with the manager. After a lengthy conversation, the manager 
came over and said, “I’m very sorry. We don’t have sugar.” 
Disappointed, I changed my order to a cup of coffee, which 
the waiter soon brought over. Resting on the saucer were two 
packets of sugar. My failure to obtain a cup of sweet green tea 
was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice. 
In America, a paying customer has every right to have a 
request met. But from a Japanese perspective, it is their duty 
to protect those who do not know any better.
