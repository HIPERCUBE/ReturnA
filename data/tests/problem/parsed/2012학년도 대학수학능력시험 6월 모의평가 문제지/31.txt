It is the end of a long, tiring day at Walt Disney World, and a 
busload of parents and children are starting the twenty-minute 
ride back to their hotel. The children are overstimulated and 
annoyed, and so are the parents. Everyone is whiny. It is a bus 
ride from hell. Then, rising above the unpleasant buzz of 
complaining children and parents, comes a thin, persistent 
melody: The bus driver has started to sing the song ‘Under the 
Sea’ from the movie The Little Mermaid. Everyone begins to 
quiet down and listen. Eventually a little girl joins in, then 
several more children. By the end of the ride everyone is 
singing ‘The Circle of Life’ from the movie The Lion King. 
The bus ride from hell has become the pleasurable, song-filled 
end to a full day.
