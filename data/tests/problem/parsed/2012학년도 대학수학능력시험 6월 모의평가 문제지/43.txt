A few years ago we purchased a brand-new camper van. 
Not long after we bought our camper, a friend of ours 
asked if her family could borrow it. We were not too 
interested in loaning out our spotless camper, so we 
declined.
(A) That in itself would not have been so bad had it not been 
for the mice. Mice were attracted by the food and they 
shredded all the curtains, screens, and cushions. Had we 
let the friend borrow the camper, she would have 
discovered the boxes before the mice did.
(B) This happened in the fall, and we stored the camper in our 
backyard all that winter. In the spring my husband and I 
were setting it up to prepare for a trip.
(C) We were very surprised to find that we had left cookie 
boxes in the camper over the winter. We had moved and 
had a baby that previous summer and fall, and cleaning 
out the camper had been overlooked.
