Behavioral evidence for separate types of taste receptors 
comes from studies of the following type: Soak your tongue 
for 15 seconds in a sour solution, such as unsweetened 
lemon juice. Then try tasting some other sour solution, such 
as dilute vinegar. You will find that the second solution 
tastes less sour than usual. Depending on the concentrations 
of the lemon juice and vinegar, the second solution may not 
taste sour at all. This phenomenon, called adaptation, 
reflects the fatigue of receptors sensitive to sour tastes. 
Now try tasting something salty, sweet, or bitter. These 
substances taste about the same as usual. In short, you 
experience little cross-adaptation― reduced response to 
one taste after exposure to another. Evidently, the sour 
receptors are different from the other taste receptors. 
Similarly, you can show that salt receptors are different 
from the others and so forth.
The fact that the intensity of a taste is (A)  after trying 
the same taste, but not after trying a different taste, serves 
as evidence for the existence of (B)  receptors for 
different tastes.
