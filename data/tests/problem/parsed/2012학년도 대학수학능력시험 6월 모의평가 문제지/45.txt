Behavioral evidence for separate types of taste receptors 
comes from studies of the following type: Soak your tongue 
for 15 seconds in a sour solution, such as unsweetened 
lemon juice. Then try tasting some other sour solution, such 
as dilute vinegar. You will find that the second solution 
tastes less sour than usual. Depending on the concentrations 
of the lemon juice and vinegar, the second solution may not 
taste sour at all. This phenomenon, called adaptation, 
reflects the fatigue of receptors sensitive to sour tastes. 
Now try tasting something salty, sweet, or bitter. These 
substances taste about the same as usual. In short, you 
experience little cross-adaptation― reduced response to 
one taste after exposure to another. Evidently, the sour 
receptors are different from the other taste receptors. 
Similarly, you can show that salt receptors are different 
from the others and so forth.
The fact that the intensity of a taste is (A)  after trying 
the same taste, but not after trying a different taste, serves 
as evidence for the existence of (B)  receptors for 
different tastes.
(A) (B)
① increased …… adaptive
② increased …… identical
③ measured …… sensitive
④ decreased …… distinct
⑤ decreased …… collective

My sister, Tara, was the quiet one in the family. She was 
not as adventurous as my brother and I. She never excelled at 
school or sports. Of course, I loved my sister, but, at times, 
that was not so easy to do. She seldom made eye contact 
with me. When we ran into each other at school, (a) she 
sometimes pretended not to recognize me.
One day, my father’s job forced us to move to a new 
neighborhood. The nurse at our new school, Emerson, gave 
us ear and eye exams, our first ever. I aced the tests― “Eagle 
eyes and elephant ears,” the nurse said― but Tara struggled 
to read the eye chart. (b) She declared Tara severely 
shortsighted and she had to get glasses. When the glasses 
were ready, we all went downtown to pick them up. The first 
time she tried them on, she kept moving her head around and 
up and down. “What’s the matter?” I asked. “You can see that 
tree over there?” she said, pointing at a sycamore tree about a 
hundred feet away. I nodded. (c) She sobbed, “I can see not 
just the branches, but each little leaf.” Tara burst into tears.
On the way home, she kept seeing for the first time all 
these things that most everyone else had stopped noticing. 
She read street signs and billboards aloud. She pointed out 
sparrows sitting on the telephone wires. At home, Tara 
insisted that I try on her glasses. I put them on, and the world 
turned into fuzzy, unfocused shapes. I took a few steps and 
banged my knee on the coffee table. It was at that very 
moment that I truly understood Tara for the first time. I 
realized why (d) she did not like to go exploring, or why she 
did not recognize me at school.
Tara loved seeing the world clearly. Not long after she got 
her glasses, she decided she wanted to be an artist. She 
started compulsively drawing and painting all the wondrous 
things she was discovering. (e) Her first painting of the 
sycamore tree is still her favorite. Today, she is an art teacher 
at Emerson, where she tries to bring the best out of each 
individual student.

(A)
I observe the moon wherever I go. What phase is it in, I 
wonder? When will it reach the full moon phase? Now 
imagine what happened to me recently when I was teaching 
in Australia, 12,000 miles from my hometown in North 
America. Shortly after my arrival, seeing that the skies were 
cloudy, I checked the newspaper for a weather report. 
Typically, the weather page also gives times for sunrise and 
sunset as well as moonrise and moonset.
(B)
Picture my surprise when I discovered that the illustrations 
in the newspaper were, by my experience, wrong. The 
waxing moon appeared to be illuminated on the left side 
rather than the right side as I had always known it to be. “I 
must call the newspaper,” I thought. But I continued to study 
the images in the newspaper and then consulted a globe.

(C)
The point is that often we do not see things as they are. 
Instead, we see things as we are. That is why it is necessary 
in science to have many people making many observations 
of the same phenomenon. I am sure that to people in 
Australia,         .
(D)
When I imagined myself standing on a spot in the southern 
hemisphere, the answer came to me. Here, indeed, south of 
the equator, the waxing moon appears to be on the left. Try 
this in your imagination, and you will see it, too.
