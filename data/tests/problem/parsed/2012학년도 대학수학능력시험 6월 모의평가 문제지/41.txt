41. Virtuoso violinist Pinchas Zukerman was giving a master 
class to a group of young artists who had come to the Aspen 
Music Festival from all over the world. The auditorium was 
filled with aspiring artists, distinguished teachers, and 
well-known performers; the atmosphere was competitive and 
electric. As each performer played, Zukerman offered friendly 
advice and encouragement, invariably picking up his own 
violin to demonstrate finer points of technique. The last 
musician performed brilliantly. When the applause subsided, 
Zukerman complimented the artist, then picked up his own 
violin, tucked it under his chin, paused a long moment, and 
then, without playing a note or uttering a word, he placed the 
instrument back in its case. The audience responded with 
deafening applause, in recognition of this master musician 
who could pay so gracious a compliment.
