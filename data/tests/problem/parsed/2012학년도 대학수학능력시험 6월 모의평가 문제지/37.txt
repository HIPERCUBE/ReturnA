37. Guillaume de Machaut에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Guillaume de Machaut, who was famous as both a musician 
and a poet, was born in the French province of Champagne. He 
studied theology and spent much of his life in the service of 
various royal families. Around 1323, he became secretary and 
chaplain to John, king of Bohemia, whom he accompanied on 
trips and military campaigns throughout Europe. In his later 
years he lived mainly in Reims, where he served as a church 
official. Machaut traveled to many courts and presented 
beautifully decorated copies of his music and poetry to his 
noble patrons. These copies make Machaut one of the first 
important composers whose works have survived. The decline 
of the church in the fourteenth century is reflected in 
Machaut’s output, which consists mainly of courtly love songs 
for one to four performers.
