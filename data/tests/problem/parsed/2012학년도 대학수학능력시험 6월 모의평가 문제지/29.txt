29. When you are picking out products in the grocery store, 
searching for the best possible strawberry jam, you are trying 
to maximize your own enjoyment. You are the only person 
that matters; it is your sense of pleasure that you are trying to 
please. In this case, (A)  is the ideal strategy. You 
should listen to those cells in the brain that tell you what you 
really want. However, when you are making a moral decision, 
this egocentric strategy backfires. Moral decisions require taking 
other people into account. You cannot act like a greedy brute 
or let your anger get out of control. Doing the right thing 
means thinking about (B) , using the emotional 
brain to mirror the emotions of strangers. Selfishness needs to 
be balanced by some selflessness.
* backfire: 역효과를 낳다
(A) (B)
① selflessness …… your neighbors
② selflessness …… utmost justice
③ self-esteem …… genuine happiness
④ selfishness …… eternal beauty
⑤ selfishness …… everybody else
