42. Whenever you stand on a scale in your bathroom or place a 
melon on a scale at the grocery store, you are measuring 
weight. An object’s weight is the force exerted on it by 
gravity, usually the earth’s gravity. When you stand on a 
bathroom scale, the scale measures just how much upward 
force it must exert on you in order to keep you from moving 
downward toward the earth’s center. As in most scales you will 
encounter, the bathroom scale uses a spring to provide this 
upward support. If you are stationary, you are not accelerating, 
so your downward weight and the upward force from the 
spring must cancel one another; that is, they must be equal in 
magnitude but opposite in direction so that they sum to zero 
net force.
