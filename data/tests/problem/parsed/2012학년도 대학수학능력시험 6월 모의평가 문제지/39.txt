39. Here is a surprise for you: Being happy means that you 
realize that there are times that you will be unhappy and 
recognize that life sometimes stinks. What is uplifting in those 
times is appreciating life and facing the challenges that come 
with it, realizing that you are facing challenges fellow humans 
have also faced. We are not saying you should lower your 
expectations for your so-called perfect life or downsize your 
goals; we just believe that if you can align your expectations  
with reality a little more by expecting to face challenges, you 
will be better off in the end. There is an interesting biological 
reinforcement for this notion, too: Your levels of C-reactive 
protein (a marker of damaging inflammation) have been shown 
to be higher when you have expectations that are unattainable.
