26. The hazards of migration range from storms to starvation, 
but they are outweighed by the advantages to be found in the 
temporary superabundance of food in the summer home. The 
process of evolution ensures that a species migrates only if it 
pays it to do so. Birds of the same species may be migratory 
in one area, but sedentary elsewhere. Most song thrushes 
migrate from northern Scotland; but in the south of England, 
the balance of advantage against disadvantage is so delicate 
that while some migrate to Spain and Portugal, the majority 
normally   over winter. Moreover, 
England’s winters have been getting warmer since the late 
1980’s and if the trend continues it is likely that our song 
thrushes will become increasingly sedentary.
