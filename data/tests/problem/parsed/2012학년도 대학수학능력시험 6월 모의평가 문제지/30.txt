30. We tend to consider ourselves as rational decision makers, 
logically evaluating the costs and benefits of each alternative 
we encounter. (A) , we are much more primitive than 
most assume. A team of economists looked at how consumers 
reacted to various pitches by banks to take out a loan. A 
purely rational view would have predicted that interest rates 
would be the only factor that had an impact. But the scientists 
varied more than just the interest rate; they also tested how 
persuasive other approaches might be. (B) , some 
letters offered a chance to win a cell phone in a lottery if the 
customer came in to inquire about a loan. They found that 
such an offer increased loan inquiries by as much as dropping 
the interest rate five points. For a $50,000 loan, this meant 
some customers were in essence willing to pay $16,000 more 
in interest to receive a $100 cell phone.
