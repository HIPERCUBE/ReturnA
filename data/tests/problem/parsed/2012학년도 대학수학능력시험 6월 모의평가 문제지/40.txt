40. The Greek philosopher Socrates observed, “The unexamined 
life is not worth living.” For most people, however, reflection 
and self-examination do not come naturally. As much as any 
other kind of thinking, reflection requires solitude. Distraction 
and reflection simply do not mix. It is not the kind of thing 
you can do well near a television, while the phone is ringing, 
or with children in the same room. One of the reasons I have 
been able to accomplish much and keep growing personally is 
that I have not only set aside time to reflect, but I have 
separated myself from distractions for short blocks of time: 
thirty minutes in the spa; an hour outside on a rock in my 
backyard; or a few hours in a comfortable chair in my office. 
The place does not matter⎯ as long as you remove yourself 
from distractions and interruptions.
