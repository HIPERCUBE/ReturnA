Lantin decided on a necklace which had been one of his 
wife’s favorites. ① It must be worth at least seven or eight 
francs he thought, because for an imitation piece the 
workmanship was very good. He put it in his pocket and went 
looking for a reliable-looking jeweler. At length he saw 
② one and went in, a little ashamed of selling something so 
worthless. “Monsieur,” he said to the dealer, “I’d like you to 
value ③ this piece for me if you’d be so kind.” The man took 
④ the article, examined it, turned it over, weighed it, and took 
up a magnifying glass to look at it more closely. Lantin was a 
little embarrassed by all this ceremony and was about to say, 
“Look, I’m pretty sure it’s got no value at all,” when the 
jeweler announced: “Monsieur, I’d put it at between 12,000 
and 15,000 francs. However, I could not purchase ⑤ this from 
you without knowing its exact provenance.”
* provenance: 출처

적절한 것은?
When induced to give spoken or written witness to 
something they doubt, people will often feel bad about their 
deceit. Nevertheless, they begin to believe (A) what / that they 
are saying. When there is no compelling external explanation 
for one’s words, saying becomes believing. Tory Higgins and 
his colleagues had university students read a personality 
description of someone and then (B) summarize / summarized 
it for someone else who was believed either to like or to dislike 
this person. The students wrote a more positive description 
when the recipient liked the person. Having said positive 
things, they also then liked the person more themselves. 
(C) Asked / Asking to recall what they had read, they remembered 
the description as being more positive than  it was. In short, it 
seems that we are prone to adjust our messages to our listeners, 
and, having done so, to believe the altered message.
(A) (B) (C)
① what …… summarize …… Asked
② what …… summarize …… Asking
③ what …… summarized …… Asked
④ that …… summarized …… Asking
⑤ that …… summarized …… Asked
21. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
We want to stop watching so much TV, but demonstrably, 
we also want to watch lots of TV. So what we really want, it 
seems, ① is to stop wanting. We ② are trapped deep in a 
paradox: deciding on the best course of action, then doing 
something else. The way around this is ③ to see that habits 
are responses to needs. This sounds ④ obvious, but countless 
efforts at habit change ignore its implications. If you eat 
badly, you might resolve to start eating well. However, if you 
are eating burgers and ice-cream to feel comforted, relaxed 
and happy, ⑤ try to replace them with broccoli and carrot 
juice is like dealing with a leaky bathroom tap by repainting 
the kitchen. What is required is not a better diet, but an 
alternative way to feel comforted and relaxed.
22. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
A way to get things done more efficiently and get better 
results is to do the right thing at the right time of day. Know 
your own body rhythm, respect your internal clock, and pay 
attention to how your energy level ebbs and flows during the 
day. If you have lots of energy early in the morning, that is 
when you should schedule difficult activities, whether for you 
these are brainstorming, writing, or practicing. Use the same 
principle in planning activities for your team. Schedule 
intervals of productive time and breaks so that you get the most 
from people. I always ask people to respect their own body 
rhythms when scheduling appointments. In my experience, 
most people are far more productive in the morning, but there 
are those who differ and hit their stride later in the day.
① 업무 성과를 높이기 위해 오후 근무시간을 늘려라.
② 신체리듬에 따라 일할 수 있도록 배려하라.
③ 업무의 특성에 따라 계획을 효과적으로 세우게 하라.
④ 어려운 일은 공동 작업을 통해 해결하게 하라.
⑤ 적절한 휴식 간격을 유지함으로써 신체리듬을 조절하게 하라.

23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Since the 1980’s, zoos have strived to reproduce the natural 
habitats of their animals, replacing concrete floors and steel 
bars with grass, rocks, trees, and pools of water. These 
environments may simulate the wild, but the animals do not have 
to worry about finding food, shelter, or safety from predators. 
① While this may not seem like such a bad deal at first glance, 
the animals experience numerous complications. ② And yet, 
most of the complications were settled with no delay in order to 
ensure the animals’ health and safety. ③ The zebras live 
constantly in fear, smelling the lions in the nearby Great Cats 
exhibit every day and finding themselves unable to escape. 
④ There is no possibility of migrating or of storing food for the 
winter, which must seem to promise equally certain doom to a 
bird or bear. ⑤ In short, zoo life is utterly incompatible with an 
animal’s most deeply-rooted survival instincts.
* doom: 파멸, 종말

24. The wrapping of Christmas presents, William Waits notes, 
is a fairly recent phenomenon in American life. It arose at the 
turn of the 20th century, during a period when hand-made 
presents were giving way to machine-made, store-bought 
ones. For both givers and manufacturers, this shift presented a 
problem, for the machine-made items, precisely because they 
were convenient, represented less of the giver’s personal 
attention than the hand-made items had done; thus they were 
symbolically less intimate. To disguise this loss of symbolic 
value, and to invest the manufactured items with a personal 
touch, retailers encouraged shoppers to have their purchases 
gift-wrapped. Gift-wrapping, in Waits’s acute term, became a 
‘decontaminating mechanism’ that removed the presents from 
the ‘normal flow of bought-and-sold goods’ and made them, 
for a single ceremonial moment, emblems of  rather 
than commerce.
* emblem: 상징
① intimacy ② disguise ③ generosity
④ convenience ⑤ encouragement
25. Some people tend to be late as a general rule, whether they 
are busy or not. To stop being late, all one has to do is change 
the motivation by deciding that in all circumstances being 
on time is going to have first priority over any other 
consideration. Presto! You will never have to run for a plane 
or miss an appointment again. As a lifelong latecomer, that is 
how I cured myself. Having made the decision that  
was now of major importance, I found that answers came 
automatically to such questions as “Can I squeeze in one more 
errand before the dentist?” or “Do I have to leave for the 
airport now?” The answers are always no, and yes. Choosing 
to be on time will make your life enormously easier, and that 
of your family, friends, and colleagues as well.
① harmony ② precision ③ promptness
④ consistency ⑤ thriftiness
26. The hazards of migration range from storms to starvation, 
but they are outweighed by the advantages to be found in the 
temporary superabundance of food in the summer home. The 
process of evolution ensures that a species migrates only if it 
pays it to do so. Birds of the same species may be migratory 
in one area, but sedentary elsewhere. Most song thrushes 
migrate from northern Scotland; but in the south of England, 
the balance of advantage against disadvantage is so delicate 
that while some migrate to Spain and Portugal, the majority 
normally   over winter. Moreover, 
England’s winters have been getting warmer since the late 
1980’s and if the trend continues it is likely that our song 
thrushes will become increasingly sedentary.
* sedentary: 이주하지 않는   ** thrush: [조류] 개똥지빠귀
① suffer from a scarcity of food
② do not lay eggs
③ stay in England
④ fly back to Scotland
⑤ migrate somewhere north of England
27. Some people believe that    is some kind 
of instinct, developed because it benefits our species in some 
way. At first, this seems like a strange idea: Darwin’s theories 
of evolution presume that individuals should act to preserve 
their own interests, not those of the species as a whole. But 
the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins believes 
that natural selection has given us the ability to feel pity for 
someone who is suffering. When humans lived in small 
clan-based groups, a person in need would be a relative or 
someone who could pay you back a good turn later, so taking 
pity on others could benefit you in the long run. Modern 
societies are much less close-knit and when we see a heartfelt 
appeal for charity, chances are we may never even meet the 
person who is suffering― but the emotion of pity is still in 
our genes. [3점]
① not wanting to suffer ② giving to charity
③ drawing pity from others ④ exploring alternatives
⑤ pursuing individual interests
28. Essentially, your reputation is your most valuable asset―
so guard it well. But do not be terribly demoralized if you make 
some mistakes along the way. With time it is possible to repair 
a stained reputation. Every experience you have with someone 
else is like a drop of water falling into a pool. As your 
experiences with that person grow, the drops accumulate and 
the pool deepens. Positive interactions are clear drops of water 
and negative interactions are red drops of water. But they 
are not equal. That is,    , and 
that number differs for different people. Those who are very 
forgiving only need a few positive experiences― clear drops
― to dilute a bad experience, while those who are less 
forgiving need a lot more to wash away the red. [3점]
① a number of clear drops can dry up with time
② a drop of red water can lead your life to ruin
③ a number of water drops can affect your experience
④ a number of red drops can accumulate gradually
⑤ a number of clear drops can dilute one red drop

29. When you are picking out products in the grocery store, 
searching for the best possible strawberry jam, you are trying 
to maximize your own enjoyment. You are the only person 
that matters; it is your sense of pleasure that you are trying to 
please. In this case, (A)  is the ideal strategy. You 
should listen to those cells in the brain that tell you what you 
really want. However, when you are making a moral decision, 
this egocentric strategy backfires. Moral decisions require taking 
other people into account. You cannot act like a greedy brute 
or let your anger get out of control. Doing the right thing 
means thinking about (B) , using the emotional 
brain to mirror the emotions of strangers. Selfishness needs to 
be balanced by some selflessness.
* backfire: 역효과를 낳다
(A) (B)
① selflessness …… your neighbors
② selflessness …… utmost justice
③ self-esteem …… genuine happiness
④ selfishness …… eternal beauty
⑤ selfishness …… everybody else
30. We tend to consider ourselves as rational decision makers, 
logically evaluating the costs and benefits of each alternative 
we encounter. (A) , we are much more primitive than 
most assume. A team of economists looked at how consumers 
reacted to various pitches by banks to take out a loan. A 
purely rational view would have predicted that interest rates 
would be the only factor that had an impact. But the scientists 
varied more than just the interest rate; they also tested how 
persuasive other approaches might be. (B) , some 
letters offered a chance to win a cell phone in a lottery if the 
customer came in to inquire about a loan. They found that 
such an offer increased loan inquiries by as much as dropping 
the interest rate five points. For a $50,000 loan, this meant 
some customers were in essence willing to pay $16,000 more 
in interest to receive a $100 cell phone.
(A) (B)
① However …… For instance
② However …… Moreover
③ Furthermore …… In contrast
④ Likewise …… In other words
⑤ Likewise …… Consequently

It is the end of a long, tiring day at Walt Disney World, and a 
busload of parents and children are starting the twenty-minute 
ride back to their hotel. The children are overstimulated and 
annoyed, and so are the parents. Everyone is whiny. It is a bus 
ride from hell. Then, rising above the unpleasant buzz of 
complaining children and parents, comes a thin, persistent 
melody: The bus driver has started to sing the song ‘Under the 
Sea’ from the movie The Little Mermaid. Everyone begins to 
quiet down and listen. Eventually a little girl joins in, then 
several more children. By the end of the ride everyone is 
singing ‘The Circle of Life’ from the movie The Lion King. 
The bus ride from hell has become the pleasurable, song-filled 
end to a full day.
① irritated → delighted ② ashamed → grateful
③ excited → depressed ④ amused → frightened
⑤ relaxed → perplexed

적절한 것은?
Back in the 1870’s, Sholes & Co., a leading manufacturer of 
typewriters at the time, received many (A) complaints /
compliments from users about typewriter keys sticking 
together if the operator went too fast. In response, management 
asked its engineers to figure out a way to prevent this from 
happening. The engineers discussed the problem and then one 
of them said, “What if we (B) turned / slowed the operator 
down? If we did that, the keys would not jam together nearly 
as much.” The result was to have an inefficient keyboard 
configuration. For example, the letters ‘O’ and ‘I’ are the third 
and sixth most frequently used letters in the English language, 
and yet the engineers positioned them on the keyboard so that 
the relatively weaker fingers had to depress them. This ‘inefficient 
logic’ pervaded the keyboard, and (C) triggered / solved the 
problem of keyboard jam-up.
(A) (B) (C)
① complaints …… turned …… triggered
② complaints …… slowed …… triggered
③ complaints …… slowed …… solved
④ compliments …… slowed …… solved
⑤ compliments …… turned …… solved

According to Cambodian legends, lions once roamed the 
countryside attacking villagers and their precious buffalo, and 
long before the great Khmer Empire began in the 9th century, 
farmers developed a fierce martial art to defend themselves 
against the ① predator. These techniques became bokator. 
Meaning ‘to fight a lion,’ bokator is a martial art ② depicted 
on the walls of Angkor Wat. There are 10,000 moves to 
master, ③ mimicking animals such as monkeys, elephants and 
even ducks. King Jayavarman VII, the warrior king who 
united Cambodia in the 12th century, made his army train in 
bokator, turning it into a ④ fearsome fighting force. Despite 
its long tradition in Cambodia, bokator ⑤ flourished when the 
Khmer Rouge took power in 1975 and executed most of the 
discipline’s masters over the next four years.
[34~35] 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
34. While in Japan, I ordered green tea with sugar at a 
restaurant. A waiter politely explained that one does not drink 
green tea with sugar. I responded that I was aware of this 
custom but I liked my tea sweet. The waiter took up the issue 
with the manager. After a lengthy conversation, the manager 
came over and said, “I’m very sorry. We don’t have sugar.” 
Disappointed, I changed my order to a cup of coffee, which 
the waiter soon brought over. Resting on the saucer were two 
packets of sugar. My failure to obtain a cup of sweet green tea 
was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice. 
In America, a paying customer has every right to have a 
request met. But from a Japanese perspective, it is their duty 
to protect those who do not know any better.

① historical perspectives on Japanese customs
② difficulty of altering tea-drinking habits
③ various factors influencing customer preference
④ health benefits of drinking green tea
⑤ cultural difference in dealing with customer requests
35. After a stressful day, how do you wind down and clear your 
mind? Relaxing in a comfortable chair, putting on some 
soothing sounds, and reading something light and entertaining 
are all good methods to get ready for some restful sleep. But as 
you ease your exhausted senses, do not forget your sense of 
smell. Certain aromas can fill you with feelings of tranquility, 
and research has found that lavender, vanilla, and green apple 
are among the best smells to help lower anxiety and induce 
sleep. You can use essential oils of these scents by applying 
them to the back of your neck or the inside of your wrist. Even 
better, indulge in a warm bath with these oils dissolved in the 
water. Before bed, you might enjoy a glass of hot soy milk with 
natural vanilla flavoring for a calming effect inside and out.
① usefulness of aroma for restful sleep
② factors inhibiting good sleep
③ origins of aromatic stress-relievers
④ reasons for stress and fatigue
⑤ ways of extracting various essential oils

second and the third most preferred types of websites. ④ The 
three least preferred types of websites are Wikipedia, Blogs,

37. Guillaume de Machaut에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Guillaume de Machaut, who was famous as both a musician 
and a poet, was born in the French province of Champagne. He 
studied theology and spent much of his life in the service of 
various royal families. Around 1323, he became secretary and 
chaplain to John, king of Bohemia, whom he accompanied on 
trips and military campaigns throughout Europe. In his later 
years he lived mainly in Reims, where he served as a church 
official. Machaut traveled to many courts and presented 
beautifully decorated copies of his music and poetry to his 
noble patrons. These copies make Machaut one of the first 
important composers whose works have survived. The decline 
of the church in the fourteenth century is reflected in 
Machaut’s output, which consists mainly of courtly love songs 
for one to four performers.
① 신학을 공부한 후 일생 동안 평민을 위해 봉사했다.
② 1323년경 Bohemia 왕이 되어 전쟁에 참여하였다.
③ Reims에 사는 동안에는 교회 활동을 하지 않았다.
④ 귀족 후원자들에게 자신의 음악과 시의 사본을 주었다.
⑤ 14세기 교회의 부흥이 그의 작품 속에 반영되어 있다.
38. Bloodhound Car에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
What’s faster than a speeding bullet and isn’t named 
Superman? The answer is the Bloodhound Car, or soon will 
be. Now being built in England, it is expected to be completed 
within a year. Powered by three engines, it is designed to go 
1,050 miles per hour (mph), which would blast past the current 
land speed record of 763 mph, set in 1997. It is 13 meters long, 
1.5 meters wide and 2 meters tall, and weighs 6.4 tons. Due to 
its enormous weight, it won’t be the quickest car in the world 
from 0 to 100 mph, as it will take 15 seconds. But after that, it 
will only take 25 seconds to go from 100 to 1,000 mph! The 
Bloodhound Car is scheduled to make its record-breaking 
attempt in 2013 at the Hakskeen Pan Desert in South Africa.
① 현재 England에서 제작되고 있다.
② 시속 1,050마일로 주행이 가능하도록 설계되어 있다.
③ 출발 후 시속 100마일에 도달하는 시간이 세계에서 가장 짧을 것이다.
④ 시속 100마일에서 1,000마일로 높이는 데 25초가 걸릴 것이다.
⑤ Hakskeen Pan Desert에서 기록 경신에 도전할 예정이다.

39. Here is a surprise for you: Being happy means that you 
realize that there are times that you will be unhappy and 
recognize that life sometimes stinks. What is uplifting in those 
times is appreciating life and facing the challenges that come 
with it, realizing that you are facing challenges fellow humans 
have also faced. We are not saying you should lower your 
expectations for your so-called perfect life or downsize your 
goals; we just believe that if you can align your expectations  
with reality a little more by expecting to face challenges, you 
will be better off in the end. There is an interesting biological 
reinforcement for this notion, too: Your levels of C-reactive 
protein (a marker of damaging inflammation) have been shown 
to be higher when you have expectations that are unattainable.
* align: (일직선으로) 맞추다   ** inflammation: 염증

③ 타인의 입장을 이해하는 것이 행복의 출발점이다.
④ 신체적 고통을 치유하려면 마음의 평화를 찾아야 한다.
⑤ 행복하려면 큰 목표를 세우고 끊임없이 도전해야 한다.
40. The Greek philosopher Socrates observed, “The unexamined 
life is not worth living.” For most people, however, reflection 
and self-examination do not come naturally. As much as any 
other kind of thinking, reflection requires solitude. Distraction 
and reflection simply do not mix. It is not the kind of thing 
you can do well near a television, while the phone is ringing, 
or with children in the same room. One of the reasons I have 
been able to accomplish much and keep growing personally is 
that I have not only set aside time to reflect, but I have 
separated myself from distractions for short blocks of time: 
thirty minutes in the spa; an hour outside on a rock in my 
backyard; or a few hours in a comfortable chair in my office. 
The place does not matter⎯ as long as you remove yourself 
from distractions and interruptions.

④ 장소에 따라 명상과 자기성찰에 필요한 시간이 달라진다.
⑤ 자기성찰은 고대 그리스 철학에 대한 탐구로부터 시작된다.

41. Virtuoso violinist Pinchas Zukerman was giving a master 
class to a group of young artists who had come to the Aspen 
Music Festival from all over the world. The auditorium was 
filled with aspiring artists, distinguished teachers, and 
well-known performers; the atmosphere was competitive and 
electric. As each performer played, Zukerman offered friendly 
advice and encouragement, invariably picking up his own 
violin to demonstrate finer points of technique. The last 
musician performed brilliantly. When the applause subsided, 
Zukerman complimented the artist, then picked up his own 
violin, tucked it under his chin, paused a long moment, and 
then, without playing a note or uttering a word, he placed the 
instrument back in its case. The audience responded with 
deafening applause, in recognition of this master musician 
who could pay so gracious a compliment.

42. Whenever you stand on a scale in your bathroom or place a 
melon on a scale at the grocery store, you are measuring 
weight. An object’s weight is the force exerted on it by 
gravity, usually the earth’s gravity. When you stand on a 
bathroom scale, the scale measures just how much upward 
force it must exert on you in order to keep you from moving 
downward toward the earth’s center. As in most scales you will 
encounter, the bathroom scale uses a spring to provide this 
upward support. If you are stationary, you are not accelerating, 
so your downward weight and the upward force from the 
spring must cancel one another; that is, they must be equal in 
magnitude but opposite in direction so that they sum to zero 
net force.

A few years ago we purchased a brand-new camper van. 
Not long after we bought our camper, a friend of ours 
asked if her family could borrow it. We were not too 
interested in loaning out our spotless camper, so we 
declined.
(A) That in itself would not have been so bad had it not been 
for the mice. Mice were attracted by the food and they 
shredded all the curtains, screens, and cushions. Had we 
let the friend borrow the camper, she would have 
discovered the boxes before the mice did.
(B) This happened in the fall, and we stored the camper in our 
backyard all that winter. In the spring my husband and I 
were setting it up to prepare for a trip.
(C) We were very surprised to find that we had left cookie 
boxes in the camper over the winter. We had moved and 
had a baby that previous summer and fall, and cleaning 
out the camper had been overlooked.

But when ice forms, they can walk out to a hole near 
where the seals are swimming, then sit and wait for a seal 
to pop its head up to breathe.
Across the Arctic, polar bear numbers are in decline. If the 
climate continues to warm at the current rate, the bears could 
disappear completely in the next hundred years. ( ① ) But 
for now, if you visit Churchill, Canada in October or 
November, it’s almost a sure thing you’ll see a polar bear in 
the wild. ( ② ) Churchill, population 914, sits on the edge of 
Hudson Bay at the point where the ice first forms every 
winter. And these bears love ice. ( ③ ) Their fondness for 
frozen seas is simple: Ice means they can eat their favorite 
meal― seals. ( ④ ) Although polar bears are powerful 
marine mammals, able to swim a hundred miles or more 
nonstop, they’re too slow to catch a seal in open water. ( ⑤ ) 
Or as a bear might put it, “Dinner is served.”

Behavioral evidence for separate types of taste receptors 
comes from studies of the following type: Soak your tongue 
for 15 seconds in a sour solution, such as unsweetened 
lemon juice. Then try tasting some other sour solution, such 
as dilute vinegar. You will find that the second solution 
tastes less sour than usual. Depending on the concentrations 
of the lemon juice and vinegar, the second solution may not 
taste sour at all. This phenomenon, called adaptation, 
reflects the fatigue of receptors sensitive to sour tastes. 
Now try tasting something salty, sweet, or bitter. These 
substances taste about the same as usual. In short, you 
experience little cross-adaptation― reduced response to 
one taste after exposure to another. Evidently, the sour 
receptors are different from the other taste receptors. 
Similarly, you can show that salt receptors are different 
from the others and so forth.
The fact that the intensity of a taste is (A)  after trying 
the same taste, but not after trying a different taste, serves 
as evidence for the existence of (B)  receptors for 
different tastes.
(A) (B)
① increased …… adaptive
② increased …… identical
③ measured …… sensitive
④ decreased …… distinct
⑤ decreased …… collective

My sister, Tara, was the quiet one in the family. She was 
not as adventurous as my brother and I. She never excelled at 
school or sports. Of course, I loved my sister, but, at times, 
that was not so easy to do. She seldom made eye contact 
with me. When we ran into each other at school, (a) she 
sometimes pretended not to recognize me.
One day, my father’s job forced us to move to a new 
neighborhood. The nurse at our new school, Emerson, gave 
us ear and eye exams, our first ever. I aced the tests― “Eagle 
eyes and elephant ears,” the nurse said― but Tara struggled 
to read the eye chart. (b) She declared Tara severely 
shortsighted and she had to get glasses. When the glasses 
were ready, we all went downtown to pick them up. The first 
time she tried them on, she kept moving her head around and 
up and down. “What’s the matter?” I asked. “You can see that 
tree over there?” she said, pointing at a sycamore tree about a 
hundred feet away. I nodded. (c) She sobbed, “I can see not 
just the branches, but each little leaf.” Tara burst into tears.
On the way home, she kept seeing for the first time all 
these things that most everyone else had stopped noticing. 
She read street signs and billboards aloud. She pointed out 
sparrows sitting on the telephone wires. At home, Tara 
insisted that I try on her glasses. I put them on, and the world 
turned into fuzzy, unfocused shapes. I took a few steps and 
banged my knee on the coffee table. It was at that very 
moment that I truly understood Tara for the first time. I 
realized why (d) she did not like to go exploring, or why she 
did not recognize me at school.
Tara loved seeing the world clearly. Not long after she got 
her glasses, she decided she wanted to be an artist. She 
started compulsively drawing and painting all the wondrous 
things she was discovering. (e) Her first painting of the 
sycamore tree is still her favorite. Today, she is an art teacher 
at Emerson, where she tries to bring the best out of each 
individual student.

(A)
I observe the moon wherever I go. What phase is it in, I 
wonder? When will it reach the full moon phase? Now 
imagine what happened to me recently when I was teaching 
in Australia, 12,000 miles from my hometown in North 
America. Shortly after my arrival, seeing that the skies were 
cloudy, I checked the newspaper for a weather report. 
Typically, the weather page also gives times for sunrise and 
sunset as well as moonrise and moonset.
(B)
Picture my surprise when I discovered that the illustrations 
in the newspaper were, by my experience, wrong. The 
waxing moon appeared to be illuminated on the left side 
rather than the right side as I had always known it to be. “I 
must call the newspaper,” I thought. But I continued to study 
the images in the newspaper and then consulted a globe.
* wax: (점점) 커지다
(C)
The point is that often we do not see things as they are. 
Instead, we see things as we are. That is why it is necessary 
in science to have many people making many observations 
of the same phenomenon. I am sure that to people in 
Australia,         .
(D)
When I imagined myself standing on a spot in the southern 
hemisphere, the answer came to me. Here, indeed, south of 
the equator, the waxing moon appears to be on the left. Try 
this in your imagination, and you will see it, too.
