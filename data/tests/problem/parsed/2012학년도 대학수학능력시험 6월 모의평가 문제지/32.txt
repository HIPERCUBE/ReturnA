Back in the 1870’s, Sholes & Co., a leading manufacturer of 
typewriters at the time, received many (A) complaints /
compliments from users about typewriter keys sticking 
together if the operator went too fast. In response, management 
asked its engineers to figure out a way to prevent this from 
happening. The engineers discussed the problem and then one 
of them said, “What if we (B) turned / slowed the operator 
down? If we did that, the keys would not jam together nearly 
as much.” The result was to have an inefficient keyboard 
configuration. For example, the letters ‘O’ and ‘I’ are the third 
and sixth most frequently used letters in the English language, 
and yet the engineers positioned them on the keyboard so that 
the relatively weaker fingers had to depress them. This ‘inefficient 
logic’ pervaded the keyboard, and (C) triggered / solved the 
problem of keyboard jam-up.
