Warren McArthur graduated from Cornell in 1908 with a 
degree in mechanical engineering. He began working in the 
budding field of industrial design― patenting ten lamps 
between 1911 and 1914. He moved to Arizona in 1913, 
where he and his brother opened car dealerships. Warren 
originally ventured into furniture design and construction as 
a hobby, but at age 44, he moved to Los Angeles to design 
and manufacture metal furniture. He was among the 
pioneers in the use of aluminum for furniture, and his 
contribution included improvements and patents to facilitate 
mass production. He relocated his factory back East to New 
York in 1933 where he designed and manufactured unique 
aluminum furniture.
