24. When we behave irrationally, our behavior usually seems 
reasonable to us. When challenged, the mind says (to itself), 
“Why are these people giving me a hard time? I’m just doing 
what makes sense. Any reasonable person would see that!” 
In short, we naturally think that our thinking is fully justified. 
As far as we can tell, we are only doing what is right and 
proper and reasonable. Any fleeting thoughts suggesting that 
we might be at fault typically are  by more 
powerful self-justifying thoughts: “I don’t mean any harm. 
I’m just! I’m fair! It’s the others who are wrong!” It is 
important to recognize this nature of the human mind as its 
natural state. In other words, humans don’t have to learn 
self-justifying, self-serving, self-deceptive thinking and 
behavior. These patterns are innate in every one of us.
