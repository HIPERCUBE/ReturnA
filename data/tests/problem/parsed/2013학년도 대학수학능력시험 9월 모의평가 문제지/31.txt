Over the course of the past forty years, no country on earth 
has cut its alcohol consumption more than France. While 
consumption of beer and spirits has stayed basically steady 
in France, the per capita consumption of alcohol from wine 
① fell from 20 liters in 1962 to about 8 in 2001. One reason 
for the dwindling wine consumption is the ② acceleration of 
the French meal. In 1978, the average French meal lasted 82 
minutes. ③ Plenty of time for half a bottle, if not a whole 
bottle. Today, the average French meal has been slashed 
down to 38 minutes. Wine is a ④ victim of the disappearance 
of the leisurely meal. It is not the target of the change, but 
the decline in wine consumption is a ⑤ cause of the 
emergence of the faster, more modern, on-the-go lifestyle.
