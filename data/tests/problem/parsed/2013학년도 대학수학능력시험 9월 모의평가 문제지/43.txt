43. Studying history is not about memorizing what we 
have been told― it requires us to investigate the 
past. Like a detective, we start with the easy, known 
pieces of information.
(A) You have to go further to ask questions such as, “Why 
was he cruel?” and “What were the results of his rule?” 
Hence, studying history trains us not to accept everything 
we read or hear as the truth. Instead, it trains us to use our 
critical thinking skills to get the full picture of the past.
(B) For example, if someone told you that Chinese Emperor 
Qin Shihuang was a cruel ruler, would you simply accept 
this as the truth? Or, would you ask questions about the 
statement and look for information or evidence to support it?
(C) We then shuffle the pieces around to see how they fit 
together. Once all the pieces fit, we have the full picture. 
As we put the pieces together, we challenge ourselves 
to think of other ways to describe what we know.
