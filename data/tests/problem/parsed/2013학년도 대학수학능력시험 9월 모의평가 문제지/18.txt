Dear Mr. Johnson,
I can’t tell you how sorry I was to learn that the flood 
caused almost total damage to your home. I can only 
imagine what a terrible loss it must be. The very 
prospect of losing everything and having to start all over 
again would be overwhelming for anybody. That is why 
I want to provide you with any assistance that I can. I 
have an extra bedroom that you are welcome to use. As 
your friends and neighbors join forces to support you in 
your time of need, I’m sure that everything will seem a 
little brighter with each new day. In the meantime, please 
take good care of yourself.
With all good wishes,
Richard Jackson
