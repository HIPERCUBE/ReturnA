36. Macon에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Imagine the Titanic floating overhead: That’s what it 
would have been like to see the USS Macon fly by. Nearly 
800 feet long, the airship was completed in 1933 as part of 
an effort to equip the U.S. Navy with airborne military bases. 
With an onboard hangar, Macon was capable of launching 
five small fixed-wing planes in midair. But it never saw 
action and went down off California’s Big Sur coast during 
a storm in 1935. Rediscovered in 1980 when a fisherman 
caught a piece of the airship’s debris in his net, the wreck 
was recently surveyed and mapped using sonar and remotely 
operated robots. Government archaeologists continue to 
explore the unique site, which lies in 1,500 feet of water.
