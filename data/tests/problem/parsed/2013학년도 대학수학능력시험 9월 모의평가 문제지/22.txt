22. We often dismiss new ideas that could further our growth 
simply because they do not fit within the general framework 
of our preconceived notions and self-concepts. An enormous 
amount of time is spent simply reacting. It’s as if we are 
robots programmed to respond on cue to whatever demands 
the least time and attention, and disregard anything that 
requires putting in extra time and energy to think. We skim 
over the surface thoughtlessly. But we must acknowledge 
that thinking well is a time-consuming process. We can’t 
expect instant results. We have to slow down a bit and take 
the time to contemplate and meditate. It is the only path to 
a more meaningful and efficient existence.
