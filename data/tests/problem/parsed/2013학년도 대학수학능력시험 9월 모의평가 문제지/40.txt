40. Your culture maintains an implicit “schedule” for the right 
time to do many important things; for example, the right time 
to start dating, to finish college, to buy your own home, or 
to have a child. This unspoken timetable provides you with 
a social clock, a schedule that tells you if you’re keeping 
pace with your peers, are ahead of them, or are falling behind. 
On the basis of this social clock, you evaluate your own social 
and professional development. If you keep up with the rest 
of your peers, then you’ll feel well adjusted, competent, and 
a part of the group. If you’re late, you’ll probably experience 
feelings of dissatisfaction. Although in some cultures the social 
clock is becoming more flexible and more tolerant of deviations 
from the conventional timetable, it still exerts pressure to keep 
pace with your peers.
