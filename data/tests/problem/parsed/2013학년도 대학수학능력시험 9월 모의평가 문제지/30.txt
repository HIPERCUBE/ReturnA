30. While there are aesthetic and ethical reasons for 
preserving biodiversity, there are practical considerations as 
well. We depend on many other species for food, clothing, 
shelter, oxygen, soil fertility― the list goes on and on. In 
the United States, 25% of all prescriptions from pharmacies 
contain substances derived from plants. (A) , two 
substances effective against Hodgkin’s disease and certain 
other forms of cancer come from the rosy periwinkle, a 
flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. 
Madagascar alone harbors some 8,000 species of flowering 
plants. Unfortunately, Madagascar has lost 80% of its 
forests and about 50% of its native species. Madagascar’s 
dilemma represents that of much of the developing world. 
The island is home to over 10 million people, most of 
whom are desperately poor and hardly in a position to be 
concerned with environmental conservation. (B)  
the people of Madagascar as well as others around the 
globe could derive vital benefits from the biodiversity that 
is being destroyed.

35. 다음 글에 드러난 Liz의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Over the sky a plump black cloud moved, erasing the 
stars. At that moment, Liz heard a stealthy step far to her 
left and immediately froze. She slowly released her knees 
and straightened her head, the better to hear. The movement 
stopped, and after a long moment began again. Liz saw a 
dark figure creep into the open and draw near to the trees. 
The figure stood so still and low to the ground that it might 
have been a stump. She called softly, “Tim!” Hearing an 
answering whistle, she went toward her son and, with tears 
of delight, hugged him tightly.

36. Macon에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Imagine the Titanic floating overhead: That’s what it 
would have been like to see the USS Macon fly by. Nearly 
800 feet long, the airship was completed in 1933 as part of 
an effort to equip the U.S. Navy with airborne military bases. 
With an onboard hangar, Macon was capable of launching 
five small fixed-wing planes in midair. But it never saw 
action and went down off California’s Big Sur coast during 
a storm in 1935. Rediscovered in 1980 when a fisherman 
caught a piece of the airship’s debris in his net, the wreck 
was recently surveyed and mapped using sonar and remotely 
operated robots. Government archaeologists continue to 
explore the unique site, which lies in 1,500 feet of water.

Warren McArthur graduated from Cornell in 1908 with a 
degree in mechanical engineering. He began working in the 
budding field of industrial design― patenting ten lamps 
between 1911 and 1914. He moved to Arizona in 1913, 
where he and his brother opened car dealerships. Warren 
originally ventured into furniture design and construction as 
a hobby, but at age 44, he moved to Los Angeles to design 
and manufacture metal furniture. He was among the 
pioneers in the use of aluminum for furniture, and his 
contribution included improvements and patents to facilitate 
mass production. He relocated his factory back East to New 
York in 1933 where he designed and manufactured unique 
aluminum furniture.

The graph above shows the trends of snow sports participation 
in the four winter seasons from 2006/2007 to 2009/2010 in 
the U.S. ① Alpine skiing had the most participants and 
snowboarding had the second most across all four winter 
seasons. ② Freestyle skiing, however, had the least participants 
in each of the four seasons. ③ Over the four winter seasons, 
a steady increase was seen in the number of participants in 
both snowboarding and cross country skiing. ④ Compared to 
the previous season, the number of participants in both alpine 
skiing and freestyle skiing decreased in the 2007/2008 season.  
⑤ The combined number of participants in snowboarding and 
cross country skiing in the 2009/2010 season was smaller than 
the number of participants in alpine skiing in the same season.
39. Restoration assumes that one can recreate an artist’s 
original intent and product. At best, restorers’ and museum 
directors’ aesthetic preferences and historical theories drive 
restorations, for it is impossible to step outside one’s historical 
context. How can restorers be so sure that removing a layer 
of lacquer isn’t merely their subconscious attempt to refashion 
an artwork according to contemporary tastes? What’s 
“restorative” about that? The “restored” Sistine Chapel may 
look “authentic” today, but will it still look so when aesthetic 
and historical theories have changed? Surely the best approach 
with any great work of art is to simply leave it alone.

40. Your culture maintains an implicit “schedule” for the right 
time to do many important things; for example, the right time 
to start dating, to finish college, to buy your own home, or 
to have a child. This unspoken timetable provides you with 
a social clock, a schedule that tells you if you’re keeping 
pace with your peers, are ahead of them, or are falling behind. 
On the basis of this social clock, you evaluate your own social 
and professional development. If you keep up with the rest 
of your peers, then you’ll feel well adjusted, competent, and 
a part of the group. If you’re late, you’ll probably experience 
feelings of dissatisfaction. Although in some cultures the social 
clock is becoming more flexible and more tolerant of deviations 
from the conventional timetable, it still exerts pressure to keep 
pace with your peers.

Economic distance relates to the time and cost involved in 
traveling from the origin to the destination area and back. 
The higher the economic distance, the higher the resistance 
for that destination and, consequently, the lower the demand. 
① It follows, conversely, that between any origin and 
destination point, if the travel time or travel cost can be 
reduced, demand will increase. ② Many excellent examples 
of this are available, such as the introduction of the jet plane 
in 1959 and the introduction of the wide-bodied jets in the 
late 1960s. ③ Jet planes first cut travel time between 
California and Hawaii, for example, from twelve hours to 
five hours, and demand grew dramatically. ④ A similar 
surge in demand was experienced with the introduction of 
the wide-bodied planes for transatlantic flights. ⑤ The 
agricultural products picked up from Hawaiian farms in the 
morning were on dinner tables in Californian homes by 
evening. The introduction of these planes cut the travel cost 
by almost 50 percent between the United States and most 
countries on the European continent.
42. A former resident of Canton, Ohio, was trying to 
describe her image of the city to her classmates. She 
found they had no image of this mid-sized city. She 
described Canton as a city with major manufacturing 
facilities and a downtown revitalization program.
(A) That fact suddenly crystallized the concept of Canton. 
If Canton is destroyed, the nation might fall. That’s an 
image that gave meaning and fullness to what it meant 
to live in Canton.
(B) Her explanation moved the city from the position of no 
image to that of a negative image. The class concluded 
that Canton is a typical, boring, industrialized city.
(C) Then she suddenly recalled an experience: “I remember  
hearing from a teacher that during World War II Canton 
was a major U.S. target of the Germans.” Imagine, right 
after the cities of Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, 
appears the name of Canton.

43. Studying history is not about memorizing what we 
have been told― it requires us to investigate the 
past. Like a detective, we start with the easy, known 
pieces of information.
(A) You have to go further to ask questions such as, “Why 
was he cruel?” and “What were the results of his rule?” 
Hence, studying history trains us not to accept everything 
we read or hear as the truth. Instead, it trains us to use our 
critical thinking skills to get the full picture of the past.
(B) For example, if someone told you that Chinese Emperor 
Qin Shihuang was a cruel ruler, would you simply accept 
this as the truth? Or, would you ask questions about the 
statement and look for information or evidence to support it?
(C) We then shuffle the pieces around to see how they fit 
together. Once all the pieces fit, we have the full picture. 
As we put the pieces together, we challenge ourselves 
to think of other ways to describe what we know.

While there are many places where this traditional view 
of a scientist still holds true, labs aren’t the only place 
where science is at work.
When you hear the word science, what’s the first thing that 
comes to mind? It’s probably an image of a laboratory filled 
with glassware and sophisticated equipment. ( ① ) The 
person doing the science is wearing a white lab coat and 
probably looks rather serious while engaged in some type of 
experiment. ( ② ) Science can also be found at a construction 
site, on a basketball court, and at a concert. ( ③ ) The truth 
is that science is happening all around us. ( ④ ) It’s at work 
in the kitchen when cooking meals, and we can even use it 
when painting pictures. ( ⑤ ) Architects use science when 
designing buildings, and science also explains why your 
favorite baseball player can hit a home run.

Many of us believe that amnesia, or sudden memory 
loss, results in the inability to recall one’s name and 
identity. This belief may reflect the way amnesia is 
usually portrayed in movies, television, and literature. For 
example, when we meet Matt Damon’s character in the 
movie The Bourne Identity, we learn that he has no 
memory for who he is, why he has the skills he does, or 
where he is from. He spends much of the movie trying 
to answer these questions. However, the inability to 
remember your name and identity is exceedingly rare in 
reality. Amnesia most often results from a brain injury 
that leaves the victim unable to form new memories, but 
with most memories of the past intact.

While media often depict amnesia as a failure to (A)

amnesia actually leave the sufferers unable to (B)
