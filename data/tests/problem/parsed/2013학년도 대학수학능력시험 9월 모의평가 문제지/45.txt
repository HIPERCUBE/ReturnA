Many of us believe that amnesia, or sudden memory 
loss, results in the inability to recall one’s name and 
identity. This belief may reflect the way amnesia is 
usually portrayed in movies, television, and literature. For 
example, when we meet Matt Damon’s character in the 
movie The Bourne Identity, we learn that he has no 
memory for who he is, why he has the skills he does, or 
where he is from. He spends much of the movie trying 
to answer these questions. However, the inability to 
remember your name and identity is exceedingly rare in 
reality. Amnesia most often results from a brain injury 
that leaves the victim unable to form new memories, but 
with most memories of the past intact.

Our romantic mistakes can always be undone these days, 
which you would think is a good thing. But the very 
reversibility of our romantic commitments has only 
worsened our problem because that also undermines our 
satisfaction with our choices. To see this, you only need to 
look at a study of a group of college students in a 
photography class. The students made a print of their two 
best photographs. They were then told that they could choose 
one of the photos but that the other would be kept on file 
as an example of their work. Then, the teacher added a twist. 
One group was told that their choice was final. Whatever 
they chose, they could not change their minds later. The other 
group was told that they could switch photographs if they 
changed their minds. In a survey taken later, students who 
were allowed to change their mind liked their photos less 
than the other students.
Why this paradoxical result? According to one researcher, 
the brain has a kind of built-in defense system that works 
to make us  choices that cannot be undone. 
Despite thinking that we would like the freedom to change 
our minds, it appears that we are happier with our choices 
if we think they can’t be changed, which means we would 
be better off if we made romantic commitments more 
permanent and more difficult to break, rather than less.

(A)
Maureen Ferris was my best friend and I sometimes 
visited her house after school. Her mother was stern and 
meticulous about house cleaning. My mother, on the other 
hand, did not care as much about a messy house. She had 
sauce stains on her apron and sometimes allowed the 
laundry to pile up. In the midst of her chores, my mother 
spent time reading. This was her time away from endless 
hours of child care and housework. Unironed school blouses 
and a dirty kitchen might make (a) her feel guilty, but her 
reading never did.
(B)
I carried over the love of reading to my workplace as 
well. Off I’d go to work each day, passing on the gift of 
reading to my students. I’d watch as they discovered they 
could read and make sense of the letters and the words on 
a page. All over the world there was agreement that this was 
important, as important as eating or thinking or working. 
And then one day, I finally understood what (b) she had 
tried to show us, that reading was housework of the very 
best kind.
(C)
One day, as I played in Maureen’s clean house, her mom 
fixed me with (c) her cool gray eyes and said, “Your 
mother’s nice, but she reads too much.” I was stunned. The 
next time I caught my mother reading in her little patch of 
sunlight, I studied (d) her in the doorway and decided her 
apron could use a washing. Shame flushed through me. 
Reading was the cause― pleasure-reading in broad daylight. 
Silently, I made vows that would keep me from sharing my 
mother’s fate.
(D)
I tried my best not to follow in (e) her footsteps, but I 
didn’t know that it was already too late for me. The way 
I treasured my books revealed the extent of how much I 
was already like my mother. The years passed in a blur of 
covertly turned pages until I was a grown-up schoolteacher 
with a husband and children of my own. I struggled 
mightily with my own desire to open a novel in brazen 
daylight. My only guiltless reading occurred at night, when 
the dishes were rattling in the dishwasher and the kids 
were in bed.
