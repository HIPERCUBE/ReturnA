Many of us believe that amnesia, or sudden memory 
loss, results in the inability to recall one’s name and 
identity. This belief may reflect the way amnesia is 
usually portrayed in movies, television, and literature. For 
example, when we meet Matt Damon’s character in the 
movie The Bourne Identity, we learn that he has no 
memory for who he is, why he has the skills he does, or 
where he is from. He spends much of the movie trying 
to answer these questions. However, the inability to 
remember your name and identity is exceedingly rare in 
reality. Amnesia most often results from a brain injury 
that leaves the victim unable to form new memories, but 
with most memories of the past intact.
