42. A former resident of Canton, Ohio, was trying to 
describe her image of the city to her classmates. She 
found they had no image of this mid-sized city. She 
described Canton as a city with major manufacturing 
facilities and a downtown revitalization program.
(A) That fact suddenly crystallized the concept of Canton. 
If Canton is destroyed, the nation might fall. That’s an 
image that gave meaning and fullness to what it meant 
to live in Canton.
(B) Her explanation moved the city from the position of no 
image to that of a negative image. The class concluded 
that Canton is a typical, boring, industrialized city.
(C) Then she suddenly recalled an experience: “I remember  
hearing from a teacher that during World War II Canton 
was a major U.S. target of the Germans.” Imagine, right 
after the cities of Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, 
appears the name of Canton.
