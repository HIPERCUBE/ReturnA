34. Hundreds of species of small fishes exist in well-defined 
social organizations called schools. Fish schools vary in size 
from a few individuals to enormous populations extending 
over several square kilometers. Schools usually consist of a 
single species, with all members similar in size or age. For 
small animals with no other means of individual defense, 
schooling behavior provides a degree of protection. Predatory 
fishes have less chance of encountering prey if the prey are 
members of a school because the individuals of the prey 
species are concentrated in compact units rather than 
dispersed over a much larger area. Moreover, once a predator 
encounters a school, satiation of the predator enables most 
members of the school to escape unharmed. Large numbers 
of fishes in a school may achieve additional survival 
advantages by confusing predators with continually shifting 
and changing positions; they might even discourage hungry 
predators with the illusion of an impressively large and 
formidable opponent.
