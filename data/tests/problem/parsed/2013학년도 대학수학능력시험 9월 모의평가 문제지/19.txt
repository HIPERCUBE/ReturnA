A king once boarded a galley ship. As he passed the crew 
of slaves, ① he asked several of them what their offenses 
were. Almost every man claimed he was innocent. They laid 
the blame on someone else. One young fellow, however, 
spoke out, “Sire, ② I deserve to be here. I stole some money. 
No one is at fault but myself. I’m guilty.” Upon hearing this, 
the king seized ③ him by the shoulder and shouted, “You 
scoundrel! What are ④ you doing here with all these honest 
men? Get out of their company at once!” He was then set 
free. The key to this prisoner’s freedom was the admission 
of ⑤ his guilt.
