(A)
Maureen Ferris was my best friend and I sometimes 
visited her house after school. Her mother was stern and 
meticulous about house cleaning. My mother, on the other 
hand, did not care as much about a messy house. She had 
sauce stains on her apron and sometimes allowed the 
laundry to pile up. In the midst of her chores, my mother 
spent time reading. This was her time away from endless 
hours of child care and housework. Unironed school blouses 
and a dirty kitchen might make (a) her feel guilty, but her 
reading never did.
(B)
I carried over the love of reading to my workplace as 
well. Off I’d go to work each day, passing on the gift of 
reading to my students. I’d watch as they discovered they 
could read and make sense of the letters and the words on 
a page. All over the world there was agreement that this was 
important, as important as eating or thinking or working. 
And then one day, I finally understood what (b) she had 
tried to show us, that reading was housework of the very 
best kind.
(C)
One day, as I played in Maureen’s clean house, her mom 
fixed me with (c) her cool gray eyes and said, “Your 
mother’s nice, but she reads too much.” I was stunned. The 
next time I caught my mother reading in her little patch of 
sunlight, I studied (d) her in the doorway and decided her 
apron could use a washing. Shame flushed through me. 
Reading was the cause― pleasure-reading in broad daylight. 
Silently, I made vows that would keep me from sharing my 
mother’s fate.
(D)
I tried my best not to follow in (e) her footsteps, but I 
didn’t know that it was already too late for me. The way 
I treasured my books revealed the extent of how much I 
was already like my mother. The years passed in a blur of 
covertly turned pages until I was a grown-up schoolteacher 
with a husband and children of my own. I struggled 
mightily with my own desire to open a novel in brazen 
daylight. My only guiltless reading occurred at night, when 
the dishes were rattling in the dishwasher and the kids 
were in bed.
