23. Masks are too heavy to uphold indefinitely, and no matter 
how well you believe you are disguising yourself, others 
always know. The consequences are that you waste energy, 
sacrifice productivity, and lose people’s trust. In our study, 
all of the CEOs were concerned that dropping their masks 
would make them appear weak. In every case, however, the 
leader’s subordinates perceived the removal of the mask as 
an act of strength and courage. This, in turn, encouraged a 
culture where those subordinates did the same, creating a 
snowball effect. Some of the ways we helped the CEOs 
remove their masks were to actually name the masks, 
explore the significant personal and professional costs of 
upholding them, and ask the CEOs to reflect on the leader 
they most admired. At this point each of the CEOs was ready 
to rebuild a leadership identity based on values, strengths, 
and ambitions.
