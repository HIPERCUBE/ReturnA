Economic distance relates to the time and cost involved in 
traveling from the origin to the destination area and back. 
The higher the economic distance, the higher the resistance 
for that destination and, consequently, the lower the demand. 
① It follows, conversely, that between any origin and 
destination point, if the travel time or travel cost can be 
reduced, demand will increase. ② Many excellent examples 
of this are available, such as the introduction of the jet plane 
in 1959 and the introduction of the wide-bodied jets in the 
late 1960s. ③ Jet planes first cut travel time between 
California and Hawaii, for example, from twelve hours to 
five hours, and demand grew dramatically. ④ A similar 
surge in demand was experienced with the introduction of 
the wide-bodied planes for transatlantic flights. ⑤ The 
agricultural products picked up from Hawaiian farms in the 
morning were on dinner tables in Californian homes by 
evening. The introduction of these planes cut the travel cost 
by almost 50 percent between the United States and most 
countries on the European continent.
