Maureen Ferris was my best friend and I sometimes 
visited her house after school. Her mother was stern and 
meticulous about house cleaning. My mother, on the other 
hand, did not care as much about a messy house. She had 
sauce stains on her apron and sometimes allowed the 
laundry to pile up. In the midst of her chores, my mother 
spent time reading. This was her time away from endless 
hours of child care and housework. Unironed school blouses 
and a dirty kitchen might make (a) her feel guilty, but her 
reading never did.
