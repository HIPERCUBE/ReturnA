26. It is a common misconception among many musicians and 
non-musicians alike that . 
This is not surprising as it is natural to associate music with 
the sounds that create the melody, rather than with the quiet 
spaces between the notes. Because rests are silent, people 
often misinterpret these empty spaces as unimportant. But, 
imagine what would happen if a song was made up of only 
notes, and no rests. Aside from the fact that the “rests would 
be history” (pun intended), there would be a wall of sound 
with no reference point or discernible backbone to the music. 
This is because the spaces between the sounds provide a 
baseline and contrast for the piece, and give music structure 
and texture. In fact, it is a common saying among experienced 
musicians that a full measure of rest can hold more music 
than a full measure of blistering notes. [3점]
