33. We sometimes encounter students who come to our offices 
and ask how they could have worked so hard but still failed 
our tests. They usually tell us that they read and reread the 
textbook and their class notes, and that they thought they 
understood everything well by the time of the exam. And they 
probably did internalize some bits and pieces of the material, 
but the illusion of knowledge led them to confuse the 
familiarity they had gained from repeated exposure to the 
concepts in the course with an actual understanding of them. 
As a rule, reading text over and over again yields diminishing 
returns in actual knowledge, but it increases familiarity and 
fosters a false sense of understanding. Only by testing 
ourselves can we actually determine whether or not we really 
understand. That is one reason why teachers give tests, and 
why the best tests probe knowledge at a deep level.
① positive impact of student counseling on study skills
② importance of familiarity in gaining actual understanding
③ relationship between reading and gaining high test scores
④ tests as a means to distinguish real understanding from 
familiarity
⑤ necessity of internalizing reading materials to improve test 
scores
