39. Restoration assumes that one can recreate an artist’s 
original intent and product. At best, restorers’ and museum 
directors’ aesthetic preferences and historical theories drive 
restorations, for it is impossible to step outside one’s historical 
context. How can restorers be so sure that removing a layer 
of lacquer isn’t merely their subconscious attempt to refashion 
an artwork according to contemporary tastes? What’s 
“restorative” about that? The “restored” Sistine Chapel may 
look “authentic” today, but will it still look so when aesthetic 
and historical theories have changed? Surely the best approach 
with any great work of art is to simply leave it alone.
