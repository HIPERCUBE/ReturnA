While there are many places where this traditional view 
of a scientist still holds true, labs aren’t the only place 
where science is at work.
When you hear the word science, what’s the first thing that 
comes to mind? It’s probably an image of a laboratory filled 
with glassware and sophisticated equipment. ( ① ) The 
person doing the science is wearing a white lab coat and 
probably looks rather serious while engaged in some type of 
experiment. ( ② ) Science can also be found at a construction 
site, on a basketball court, and at a concert. ( ③ ) The truth 
is that science is happening all around us. ( ④ ) It’s at work 
in the kitchen when cooking meals, and we can even use it 
when painting pictures. ( ⑤ ) Architects use science when 
designing buildings, and science also explains why your 
favorite baseball player can hit a home run.
