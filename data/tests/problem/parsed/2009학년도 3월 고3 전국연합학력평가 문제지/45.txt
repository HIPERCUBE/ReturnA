Today, the common store of information and knowledge
is more complex and more accessible. The accessibility
of them through the Internet is now much more the
domain of the young, the masters of the new cybernetic
world. However, wisdom’s domain lies in another
direction. Wisdom is not exclusively about information
and knowledge, but about “context,” and in this arena the
young must often still yield to the old. Why? Because
when it comes to the essentials of living, it is clear we
haven’t made as much progress since ancient times.
Wisdom moves slowly because it takes a lifetime to
acquire. In fact, it is the paradox of wisdom, that the
faster we try to master it, the slower it comes to us.
Wisdom mostly remains the domain of the elders, and
the technology revolution has not diminished our need
for them.
Though technology revolution allows the young to have
(A) in knowledge and information, they should
(B) the elders for wisdom.
(A) (B)
① superiority …… consult
② options …… dismiss
③ difficulties …… consult
④ faith …… dismiss
⑤ interest …… judge

(A) It was December 1972. I had been head football
coach at Pennsylvania State University for almost seven
years. Then that unexpected phone call had come. The man
on the phone was Bill Sullivan, principal owner of the New
England Patriots. “I want to meet with you to talk about
coaching my team,” he said. (a) He hit me with his package
- $1.3 million, plus part ownership of the franchise.
(B) From the moment of that nighttime revelation, I knew
what college football means to me - and what pro football
never could mean. I love winning games as much as any
coach does, but I know there’s something that counts more
than victory or defeat. (b) I get to watch my players grow
- in their personal discipline, in their educational
development, and as human beings. That is a deep, lasting
reward that I could never get in pro ball.
(C) I pretended I was asleep. I lay there thinking about
the life I was leaving. I saw the school where I had met
my wife and got married, the only home our five kids had
ever known. I saw my thick­necked, fragile­hearted football
players. What had made me tell Sullivan I’d come? (c) Yes,
Boston was a great city and it was a new challenge. But it
was ... the money. Suddenly I knew what it was I had to
do, what it was I wanted to do. In the morning, I told Sue,
“You went to bed with a millionaire, but you woke up with
me. I’m not going.”
(D) (d) Sullivan’s offer made me dizzy. In the end, I told
my wife, “I have to take the job.” “Joe, whatever you want
to do will be fine with me,” Sue replied. (e) I called
Sullivan and told him we had a deal. When Sue and I went
to bed that evening, I was pleased. At 2:00 a.m., Sue was
sitting in her rocking chair nursing our baby. I’m sure she
thought I was asleep. She had never said she didn’t want to
go to Boston. But now tears were slipping down her face.

There is a famous psychology experiment to help us
understand how opinions and judgements can be formed.
The general experiment procedure was devised by Dr. Asch
in the U.S. What happens is this: A volunteer is asked to
join a group for the study of the discrimination of length.
And he goes to a room where a number of people and the
experimenter are seated. The volunteer doesn’t know that
the other people in the room are researchers working
together with the experimenter. A pair of cards is
introduced. On one of them there is a line and on the
other, three lines. Of these three, one is clearly longer than
the line on the other card, one is shorter and one the same
length. Seeing the cards, everyone is in turn asked which of
the three lines on the second card is equal to the line on
the first. They all pick - as they have been told to pick -
the wrong line. Last of all, comes the turn of our volunteer.
In many cases the volunteer, faced with the opinion of the
group, denies the plain evidence of his senses and picks the
same one as others do. This experiment shows even the
sane and ordinary people could be made to deny the
obvious facts, feeling the pressure to . The people
around you, “the pressure group” can have a great influence
on your judgement and decisions.
