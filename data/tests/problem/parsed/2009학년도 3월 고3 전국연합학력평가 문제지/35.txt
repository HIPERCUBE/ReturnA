The graph above shows Americans’ ratings of their life
today compared with their life five years ago. ①The
percentage of people who said their life was better off was
always higher than that of those who responded negatively.
② Especially, between 1994 and 2002, more than half the
respondents answered they were better off than five years
ago. ③ In 1990, the percentage of those who answered
positively was nearly twice as high as that of those who
answered negatively. ④ From 1990 to 1996, the gap
between the rates of the two groups increased steadily. In
1996, the highest percentage of people had the positive view
of their life. ⑤However, the year 2008 showed that about
two-thirds of the respondents had the negative view of
their life.
