하지 않은 것은?
Years ago I saw a woman showing her magic powers. She
filled a glass with water, then ① covered it with her
handkerchief, previously dipped in water. She pushed down
the center of the cloth, ② inverted the glass on her right
palm, then seized it with her left hand. Air pressure
ballooned the cloth ③ upward inside the glass. “When I put
my finger on the glass,” she explained, “it will make the
water boil.” When she did so, bubbles began ④ rising. You
could even hear the surface bubbling! What happened was this.
When she pushed with her finger, the glass slipped
downward through her left hand, causing the handkerchief to
slide upward on the outside. This ⑤ raised the center of the
cloth inside, forming a vacuum. The vacuum drew air through
the handkerchief and created an illusion of boiling water.
