38. Did I remember to turn the stove off? Did I remember to
lock the front door? I’d better look again. We all feel the
need to check again sometimes, to reassure ourselves that
we didn’t neglect a possibly dangerous problem. But for
some people, checking can consume hours every day, driven
by intense fears of unlikely scenarios. A teacher continually
searches the floor, obsessed with the idea that a dropped
needle might injure her students. A man spends an hour
every morning verifying that all the doors and windows are
shut before he leaves for work. Yet this habit of checking
doesn’t solve the worry at all, doubt still grows, and if it
gets worse, it can lead to medical treatment.
