33. We think of butterfly wings as being colorful, but many
are relatively drab on the underside. Some butterflies protect
themselves through camouflage－by folding up their wings,
they reveal the undersides and blend in with their
surroundings. Through this strategy, they become nearly
invisible to predators. Some other butterflies are brightly
and distinctively colored, but they taste nasty. A bird that
eats one of these butterflies remembers the experience－and
avoids repeating it. Now other species of butterfly that do
not taste nasty mimic the nasty ones. They are born looking
like them in color and shape but not taste. Birds and lizards,
who have learned to avoid bold warning coloration, leave
these imitators alone. * drab 칙칙한 갈색의
