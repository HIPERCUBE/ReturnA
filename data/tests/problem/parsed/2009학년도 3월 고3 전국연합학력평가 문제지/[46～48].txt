(A) It was December 1972. I had been head football
coach at Pennsylvania State University for almost seven
years. Then that unexpected phone call had come. The man
on the phone was Bill Sullivan, principal owner of the New
England Patriots. “I want to meet with you to talk about
coaching my team,” he said. (a) He hit me with his package
- $1.3 million, plus part ownership of the franchise.
(B) From the moment of that nighttime revelation, I knew
what college football means to me - and what pro football
never could mean. I love winning games as much as any
coach does, but I know there’s something that counts more
than victory or defeat. (b) I get to watch my players grow
- in their personal discipline, in their educational
development, and as human beings. That is a deep, lasting
reward that I could never get in pro ball.
(C) I pretended I was asleep. I lay there thinking about
the life I was leaving. I saw the school where I had met
my wife and got married, the only home our five kids had
ever known. I saw my thick­necked, fragile­hearted football
players. What had made me tell Sullivan I’d come? (c) Yes,
Boston was a great city and it was a new challenge. But it
was ... the money. Suddenly I knew what it was I had to
do, what it was I wanted to do. In the morning, I told Sue,
“You went to bed with a millionaire, but you woke up with
me. I’m not going.”
(D) (d) Sullivan’s offer made me dizzy. In the end, I told
my wife, “I have to take the job.” “Joe, whatever you want
to do will be fine with me,” Sue replied. (e) I called
Sullivan and told him we had a deal. When Sue and I went
to bed that evening, I was pleased. At 2:00 a.m., Sue was
sitting in her rocking chair nursing our baby. I’m sure she
thought I was asleep. She had never said she didn’t want to
go to Boston. But now tears were slipping down her face.
