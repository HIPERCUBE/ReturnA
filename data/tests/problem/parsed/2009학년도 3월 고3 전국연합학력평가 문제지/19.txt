Tom and his colleague, Sue, were attending a conference
for music teachers in New York. While at the conference
① he purchased a talking metronome, a device for counting
the beats in a song. Before Tom and Sue boarded their
flight home, Tom put his carry­on bag on the security­check
conveyor belt. The security guard’s eyes widened as ② he
watched the monitor. He asked Tom what ③ he had in the
bag. Then the guard slowly pulled out of the bag the device
covered with dials and switches. “It’s a talking metronome,”
Tom insisted. “Look, I’ll show you.” ④He took the box and
flipped a switch. “One, two, three,……” said the metronome
in perfect time. The guard breathed a sigh of relief. Sue
whispered to Tom as ⑤ he gathered his belongings, “Aren’t
you glad it didn’t go ‘Three, two, one,……’?”
