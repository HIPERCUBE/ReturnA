I feel a little overwhelmed now by all the “new” in my
life. New job. New apartment. New neighborhood. But the
best “new” is a new perspective. I don’t have to tell you
how desperate I was feeling. When things started to go from
bad to worse, I almost felt numb. That is, until you came on
the scene. I just can’t thank you enough for all the time
you’ve spent with me. Calling everyone in your network to
help me locate a new job here. Coaching me on the
interview. The hours you’ve spent on my behalf seem like
an incredible gift. Your love and concern feel like a warm
blanket on those long nights as I adjust to my new life.
