These days, lots of young people are worried about their
future because of the economic recession. More seriously,
even experts can’t predict what’s going to happen in the
near future. They just say the financial crisis won’t be
solved easily unlike the past. So, most young people,
including recent graduates, have difficulty in getting jobs.
Then, is there no way out? They should change direction!
It’s time for them to turn their eyes to the other side of
the world. They don’t necessarily have to realize their
dreams home. Instead, they need to change their stage to
perform on for their future. Of course, there are risks
involved. However, they can’t move forward if they are
afraid of the risks.
