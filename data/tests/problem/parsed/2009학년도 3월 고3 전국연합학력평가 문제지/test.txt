You experience displeasure while using various types of

displeasure is difficult and the amount of monetary loss is
small. You also don’t know where to go to handle the
displeasure and where to receive compensation. However,
you are eager to deal with these situations. This is where
you can get help. It provides you with counseling and
handles your complaints related to various fields such as
automobiles, housing and facilities, publications, services,
finance and insurance, law, and medicine. This also demands
payment for you from a corporation based on the

covered with dials and switches. “It’s a talking metronome,”
Tom insisted. “Look, I’ll show you.” ④He took the box and
flipped a switch. “One, two, three,……” said the metronome
in perfect time. The guard breathed a sigh of relief. Sue
whispered to Tom as ⑤ he gathered his belongings, “Aren’t

I feel a little overwhelmed now by all the “new” in my
life. New job. New apartment. New neighborhood. But the
best “new” is a new perspective. I don’t have to tell you
how desperate I was feeling. When things started to go from
bad to worse, I almost felt numb. That is, until you came on
the scene. I just can’t thank you enough for all the time
you’ve spent with me. Calling everyone in your network to
help me locate a new job here. Coaching me on the
interview. The hours you’ve spent on my behalf seem like
an incredible gift. Your love and concern feel like a warm
blanket on those long nights as I adjust to my new life.

If properly stored, broccoli will stay fresh for up to four

In business settings, it’s really easy to forget ① to take

interaction with others. It’s important to people that they
feel valid, important, and ② respected. Just as saying sorry
matters, so does ③ remember to thank those who help you
move forward. And I think it’s much nicer to send along a
physical card than an email. A personal note written by your
own hand matters ④ far more than a few lines of typing

One more thing: if you’re going to go this route, put in the
extra few minutes to purchase a nice card and ⑤ use a pen

Ending your shower with cold water can be good for your
health. ①Warm water makes the blood rush to your skin,
and cool water makes the blood rush to your organs. ②This
switching between hot and cold triggers better circulation by
forcing the blood to move. ③The ideal practice would be to
switch numerous times between hot and cold water, but
merely ending the shower with cold water does help with
circulation. ④Taking frequent showers in fact can cause
skin problems and other infections. ⑤ Good circulation
improves the performance of your system and thus makes
you look and feel better.

24. One of the most important aspects of green products
should be . If something is tough or can be
readily repaired, this lessens the chance that it’ll end up in
the landfill, and could easily save you money in the long
run, even if it’s initially more expensive. Even recyclable
materials, if they break and can’t be fixed, require energy
and other resources to reprocess and then replace.
Long­lasting goods can be passed on from person to person.
Even if your style changes and that kitchen table isn’t your
thing anymore, a good strong table will almost always be
appealing to someone else, while a broken and unfixable one
probably won’t.

25. A new study suggests that kids might be at increased risk
of getting the disease of the lungs depending on
. Looking at more than 95,000
infants born from 1995 to 2000, researchers followed the
children through 2005. What they found was those born in
the autumn were nearly 30% more likely to get asthma. The
researchers say it’s because babies born in the fall months
are much more likely to get common wintertime infections.
At birth, infants have protection against certain diseases
because antibodies have passed from the mother to her
unborn baby. But the protection is temporary. So, as their
immunities fade, babies become more subject to infections,
especially in the winter months when all kinds of germs are
swirling through the air. * asthma 천식

26. El Sistema, which is known as one of the most successful
social inclusion projects, is a national network of youth
orchestras and music centers in Venezuela. About three
decades ago, José Antonio Abreu developed the idea of　　
　　　　 　 , in order to offer
children from poor neighborhoods an alternative to life on
the streets. In the dangerous and poverty‐stricken slums of
Caracas, Abreu lifted children out of despair through music,
changing both people and the system of the society. In 1975
he established the first Venezuelan youth orchestra with 12
children. Since then he has built up a network of orchestras
and music centers through the whole country. Currently
250,000 children and young adults are playing a musical
instrument, and by 2012 these numbers will have doubled.

27. Much is now known about natural hazards and the
negative impacts they have on people and their property.
It would seem obvious that any logical person would avoid
such potential impacts or at least modify their behavior or
their property to minimize such impacts. However,
. Until
someone has a personal experience or knows someone who
has such an experience, most people subconsciously believe
“It won’t happen here” or “It won’t happen to me.” Even
knowledgeable scientists who are aware of the hazards, the
odds of their occurrence, and the costs of an event do not
always act appropriately. [3점]

Can you identify others’ personality from colors they like?
Some psychologists actually use personality tests based on
color (A) conference / preference . These color psychologists
have generally thought that outgoing, adventurous, and
competitive people like bold, bright colors. Conversely, people
who like softer tones are more likely to exhibit a
quieter, gentler nature. While there is some truth in such
(B) assumptions / exceptions , you should remember that
people from various backgrounds and experiences will be
attracted to certain colors and be offended by others.
Therefore, color psychology, although interesting, provides
only broad (C) regulations / generalizations in analyzing
personality types.

Years ago I saw a woman showing her magic powers. She
filled a glass with water, then ① covered it with her
handkerchief, previously dipped in water. She pushed down
the center of the cloth, ② inverted the glass on her right
palm, then seized it with her left hand. Air pressure
ballooned the cloth ③ upward inside the glass. “When I put
my finger on the glass,” she explained, “it will make the
water boil.” When she did so, bubbles began ④ rising. You
could even hear the surface bubbling! What happened was this.
When she pushed with her finger, the glass slipped
downward through her left hand, causing the handkerchief to
slide upward on the outside. This ⑤ raised the center of the
cloth inside, forming a vacuum. The vacuum drew air through
the handkerchief and created an illusion of boiling water.

It is said that a cozy hat is a must on a cold winter’s day.
We are often led to believe that most of our body heat is
lost through our heads. Closer inspection of heat loss in the
hatless, (A) , reveals that is nonsense. The myth has
arisen through a flawed interpretation of an experiment in
the 1950s. In the study, volunteers were dressed in Arctic
survival suits and exposed to bitterly cold conditions.
Because the head was the only part of their bodies left
uncovered, most of their heat was lost through their heads.
(B) , covering one part of the body has as much effect
as covering any other. If the experiment had been performed
with people wearing only swimming trunks, they would have
lost no more than 10% of their body heat through their
heads.

When I moved into a two‐bedroom flat with Ally, I thought
we could get on well. Initially, everything seemed fine.
Then, as the weeks passed, things began to change. When I
went out, she’d sneak into my room and read my journal.
She would put on my clothes and cosmetics without my
permission. Once, she took off all the framed photos of
mine, which were very important to me, and hung a large
frame of abstract painting instead. It was the last straw,
however, when she started spreading rumors; she told my
friends that I got addicted to computer games, which wasn’t
true. When I confronted her, she denied it. But I couldn’t
stand her any more.

32. Trust is the basis of all transactions. It’s the basis of the
economy. World Bank economist Stephen Knack has long
studied the economics of trust. According to him, the huge
disparity in income between the United States and Somalia
can be explained entirely as a disparity in trust. Put
differently, the income enjoyed by the American people is
0.5 percent the result of hard work and 99.5 percent the
result of trust. While that sounds extreme, there’s something
to it if you consider how market transactions and business
activities are impossible without it. Without adequate trust,
the cost of transactions rises and there are even times when
mutually beneficial transactions cannot be realized.

33. We think of butterfly wings as being colorful, but many
are relatively drab on the underside. Some butterflies protect
themselves through camouflage－by folding up their wings,
they reveal the undersides and blend in with their
surroundings. Through this strategy, they become nearly
invisible to predators. Some other butterflies are brightly
and distinctively colored, but they taste nasty. A bird that
eats one of these butterflies remembers the experience－and
avoids repeating it. Now other species of butterfly that do
not taste nasty mimic the nasty ones. They are born looking
like them in color and shape but not taste. Birds and lizards,
who have learned to avoid bold warning coloration, leave
these imitators alone. * drab 칙칙한 갈색의

These days, lots of young people are worried about their
future because of the economic recession. More seriously,
even experts can’t predict what’s going to happen in the
near future. They just say the financial crisis won’t be
solved easily unlike the past. So, most young people,
including recent graduates, have difficulty in getting jobs.
Then, is there no way out? They should change direction!
It’s time for them to turn their eyes to the other side of
the world. They don’t necessarily have to realize their
dreams home. Instead, they need to change their stage to
perform on for their future. Of course, there are risks
involved. However, they can’t move forward if they are
afraid of the risks.

The graph above shows Americans’ ratings of their life
today compared with their life five years ago. ①The
percentage of people who said their life was better off was
always higher than that of those who responded negatively.
② Especially, between 1994 and 2002, more than half the
respondents answered they were better off than five years
ago. ③ In 1990, the percentage of those who answered
positively was nearly twice as high as that of those who
answered negatively. ④ From 1990 to 1996, the gap
between the rates of the two groups increased steadily. In
1996, the highest percentage of people had the positive view
of their life. ⑤However, the year 2008 showed that about
two-thirds of the respondents had the negative view of
their life.
36. FTF에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The FTF is a trade association that promotes fair trade.
The FTF traces its roots to the late 1970s when many
individual trade organizations began holding yearly
conferences on fair trade. In 1994, they incorporated
formally as the NAATO and, the following year, changed its
name to the FTF. It envisions a just and sustainable global
economic system in which purchasing and production choices
are made with concern for the well­being of people and the
environment. It seeks to reduce poverty by continually and
significantly expanding the practice of trade that values the
labor and dignity of all people.

37. snowy plover에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The snowy plover is one of the hardest birds to spot on
the beach. Once numbering in the thousands, the species is
listed as endangered in several states now. Beige and white,
snowy plovers blend perfectly in the white sand. They eat
tiny flies that live on the sand or mud flats. Their nests
usually contain three tiny eggs, which look like sand and are
barely visible to even the most well­trained eye. Mothers
incubate the nests during the day and fathers at night.
Chicks can get out of their nest within three hours of
hatching. They walk, run, and swim well but still require
their parents’ care after hatching.

38. Did I remember to turn the stove off? Did I remember to
lock the front door? I’d better look again. We all feel the
need to check again sometimes, to reassure ourselves that
we didn’t neglect a possibly dangerous problem. But for
some people, checking can consume hours every day, driven
by intense fears of unlikely scenarios. A teacher continually
searches the floor, obsessed with the idea that a dropped
needle might injure her students. A man spends an hour
every morning verifying that all the doors and windows are
shut before he leaves for work. Yet this habit of checking
doesn’t solve the worry at all, doubt still grows, and if it
gets worse, it can lead to medical treatment.

⑤ One man’s music is another man’s noise.
39. The saying, “To err is human, to forgive, divine,” shows
the ideal we should have: people should be forgiving of
other’s mistakes. To err or to make mistakes is indeed a
part of being human but it seems that most people don’t
want to accept the responsibility for having made a mistake.
Rather, they are likely to do the opposite - to find someone
else to shift the blame to. They naturally look for someone
else who could be responsible for the problem. So the
twisted version of the saying “To err is human. To blame
the other guy is more human.” is meant to be a joke and
yet it gives us more information about human nature.

A group of scientists has devised a procedure for
locating infections without surgery.
(A) The white blood cells are injected back into the body,
and a special camera is used to pick up signals from
the indium­Ⅲ. Since white blood cells fight infection,
they will travel to the infected area, producing a signal
from the region.
(B) They take a blood sample from a patient, and they
isolate the white blood cells and mix them with a
radioactive element, indium­Ⅲ.
(C) The location of the signal discloses to the doctor where
the infection is and how critical it is. The doctor can
then select a treatment without hesitation.

41. Organizations like the National Audubon Society once
encouraged interest in birds, and bird watching became a
popular pastime and a favorite way to spend leisure time.
Unfortunately, the growth of interest has affected the birds
themselves. One rare bird can bring a flock of bird watchers.
Both vegetation and nesting places have been trampled by
feet of overenthusiastic bird watchers. Birds are naturally shy;
the presence of too many people can cause them to abandon a
nest and eggs in it. For example, a black hawk was so upset
by the people gathering to see it return to its nest that it laid
only one egg in its nest in five years. * trample 짓밟다

42. There is plenty of evidence that second­hand smoke -
breathed when you are in the same room as someone smoking
- can be harmful, particularly to children, and some parents
adopt a strategy of never smoking in their child’s presence.
According to a researcher, however, this would not offer
complete protection because there can be third­hand smoke.
Toxic particles in cigarette smoke can remain on nearby
surfaces, as well as the hair and clothing of the smoker, long
after the cigarette has been put out, and small children are
easily influenced because they are likely to breathe in close
proximity, or even lick and suck them. Therefore, it is vital
that people are made aware of the possible risks associated
with smoking on the health of children. * proximity 근접

It was dark outside, and rain fell in icy torrents. Inside,
the three children sat around their grandfather, the only light
in the room coming from an old lantern that sat on the
rough, wooden table. The children were captivated by his
every word as his low voice poured out tales of pirates,
treasure and the sea. They were certain they could hear the
sound of the rough wind hurling the surf against the rocks.
Though it was cold and wet outside in their imaginations,
inside it was warm and dry, and one by one the children’s
eyes began to close. With gentle hands, the grandfather
carried them up to their beds and tucked them in.

The study also suggests that luck is a matter of
interpretation.
Successful people often say that “you make your own
luck,” and the results from a study suggest that this is true.
( ① ) If people believe that they are lucky, then they are
more likely to continue trying until they succeed at
something. ( ② ) Those who think they are unlucky, on the other
hand, do the opposite. ( ③ ) They rarely try something new
because they “know” they will not win, and therefore they
can never succeed. ( ④ ) When one of the subjects fell
down the stairs and broke his arm, he did not think that this
was unlucky. ( ⑤ ) On the contrary, he actually felt
extremely fortunate - if he had fallen differently, he might
have broken his neck.

Today, the common store of information and knowledge
is more complex and more accessible. The accessibility
of them through the Internet is now much more the
domain of the young, the masters of the new cybernetic
world. However, wisdom’s domain lies in another
direction. Wisdom is not exclusively about information
and knowledge, but about “context,” and in this arena the
young must often still yield to the old. Why? Because
when it comes to the essentials of living, it is clear we
haven’t made as much progress since ancient times.
Wisdom moves slowly because it takes a lifetime to
acquire. In fact, it is the paradox of wisdom, that the
faster we try to master it, the slower it comes to us.
Wisdom mostly remains the domain of the elders, and

(A) It was December 1972. I had been head football
coach at Pennsylvania State University for almost seven
years. Then that unexpected phone call had come. The man
on the phone was Bill Sullivan, principal owner of the New
England Patriots. “I want to meet with you to talk about
coaching my team,” he said. (a) He hit me with his package
- $1.3 million, plus part ownership of the franchise.
(B) From the moment of that nighttime revelation, I knew
what college football means to me - and what pro football
never could mean. I love winning games as much as any
coach does, but I know there’s something that counts more
than victory or defeat. (b) I get to watch my players grow
- in their personal discipline, in their educational
development, and as human beings. That is a deep, lasting
reward that I could never get in pro ball.
(C) I pretended I was asleep. I lay there thinking about
the life I was leaving. I saw the school where I had met
my wife and got married, the only home our five kids had
ever known. I saw my thick­necked, fragile­hearted football
players. What had made me tell Sullivan I’d come? (c) Yes,
Boston was a great city and it was a new challenge. But it
was ... the money. Suddenly I knew what it was I had to
do, what it was I wanted to do. In the morning, I told Sue,
“You went to bed with a millionaire, but you woke up with
me. I’m not going.”
(D) (d) Sullivan’s offer made me dizzy. In the end, I told
my wife, “I have to take the job.” “Joe, whatever you want
to do will be fine with me,” Sue replied. (e) I called
Sullivan and told him we had a deal. When Sue and I went
to bed that evening, I was pleased. At 2:00 a.m., Sue was
sitting in her rocking chair nursing our baby. I’m sure she
thought I was asleep. She had never said she didn’t want to
go to Boston. But now tears were slipping down her face.

There is a famous psychology experiment to help us
understand how opinions and judgements can be formed.
The general experiment procedure was devised by Dr. Asch
in the U.S. What happens is this: A volunteer is asked to
join a group for the study of the discrimination of length.
And he goes to a room where a number of people and the
experimenter are seated. The volunteer doesn’t know that
the other people in the room are researchers working
together with the experimenter. A pair of cards is
introduced. On one of them there is a line and on the
other, three lines. Of these three, one is clearly longer than
the line on the other card, one is shorter and one the same
length. Seeing the cards, everyone is in turn asked which of
the three lines on the second card is equal to the line on
the first. They all pick - as they have been told to pick -
the wrong line. Last of all, comes the turn of our volunteer.
In many cases the volunteer, faced with the opinion of the
group, denies the plain evidence of his senses and picks the
same one as others do. This experiment shows even the
sane and ordinary people could be made to deny the
obvious facts, feeling the pressure to . The people
around you, “the pressure group” can have a great influence
on your judgement and decisions.
