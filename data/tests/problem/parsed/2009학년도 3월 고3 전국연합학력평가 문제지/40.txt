A group of scientists has devised a procedure for
locating infections without surgery.
(A) The white blood cells are injected back into the body,
and a special camera is used to pick up signals from
the indium­Ⅲ. Since white blood cells fight infection,
they will travel to the infected area, producing a signal
from the region.
(B) They take a blood sample from a patient, and they
isolate the white blood cells and mix them with a
radioactive element, indium­Ⅲ.
(C) The location of the signal discloses to the doctor where
the infection is and how critical it is. The doctor can
then select a treatment without hesitation.
