39. The saying, “To err is human, to forgive, divine,” shows
the ideal we should have: people should be forgiving of
other’s mistakes. To err or to make mistakes is indeed a
part of being human but it seems that most people don’t
want to accept the responsibility for having made a mistake.
Rather, they are likely to do the opposite - to find someone
else to shift the blame to. They naturally look for someone
else who could be responsible for the problem. So the
twisted version of the saying “To err is human. To blame
the other guy is more human.” is meant to be a joke and
yet it gives us more information about human nature.
