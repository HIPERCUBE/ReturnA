42. There is plenty of evidence that second­hand smoke -
breathed when you are in the same room as someone smoking
- can be harmful, particularly to children, and some parents
adopt a strategy of never smoking in their child’s presence.

complete protection because there can be third­hand smoke.
Toxic particles in cigarette smoke can remain on nearby
surfaces, as well as the hair and clothing of the smoker, long
after the cigarette has been put out, and small children are
easily influenced because they are likely to breathe in close
proximity, or even lick and suck them. Therefore, it is vital
that people are made aware of the possible risks associated
with smoking on the health of children. * proximity 근접
