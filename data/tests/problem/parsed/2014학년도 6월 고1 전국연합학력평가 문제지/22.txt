In the late 1960s, a television producer, Joan Cooney, 
started an epidemic. She targeted children between three and 
five. Her agent of infection was television and the “virus” 
she wanted to spread was literacy. The show would be an 
hour long and run 5 days a week in hopes that it would 
become contagious enough to improve education. Her aim 
was to spread positive learning values to all children and 
even their parents. She also intended for it to give 
advantages to children with fewer opportunities once they 
began elementary school. What she wanted to do, in essence, 
was create a learning epidemic to fight the wide­spread 
epidemics of poverty and illiteracy. She called her idea 
Sesame Street.
