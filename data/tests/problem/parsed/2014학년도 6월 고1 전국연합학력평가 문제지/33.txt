33. What is the difference between fines and fees? Fines 
mean moral disapproval, whereas fees are simply prices that 
imply no moral judgment. When we charge a fine for 
littering, we’re saying that littering is wrong. Tossing a beer 
can into the Grand Canyon not only charges cleanup costs. It 
reflects a bad attitude that society wants to discourage. 
Suppose the fine is $100, and a wealthy hiker decides it’s 
worth the convenience of not having to carry his empty cans 
out of the park. He _____________________________ and tosses 
his cans into the Grand Canyon. He pays up, but we think 
he’s done something wrong. By treating the Grand Canyon 
as an expensive trash can, he has failed to appreciate it 
properly. [3점]
