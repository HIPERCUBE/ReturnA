Even though people who set high expectations for 
themselves tend to achieve more in a negotiation than those 
who set low goals, they are almost always less satisfied 
with their results. Why? Because when the negotiation is 
over, they compare their final outcome to their initial 
expectations and focus on what they didn't get from the deal 
and feel like they failed. To solve this problem, they need 
to learn how to change their focus after the negotiation is 
complete. They must view their results in a more positive 
manner. With this simple adjustment of focus they will 
recognize everything they were able to get in the negotiation 
and feel pleased with their work.
