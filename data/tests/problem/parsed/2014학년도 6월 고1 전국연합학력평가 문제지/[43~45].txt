(A)
Psychologist Shawn Burn and his team decided to 
discover whether the foot­in­the­door technique might be 
able to promote recycling in Claremont. First the researchers 
secretly observed the recycling activity of the residents, 
identified about 200 households that didn’t recycle, and set 
out to see if (a) they could change the residents’ behavior. 
(B)
(b) They asked the Scouts to knock on the door of an 
unsuspecting participant. When the door opened they 
launched into their prepared speech about the importance of 
recycling. A few moments later the Scouts handed the 
resident a pledge card. It simply said, ‘I pledge support for 
Claremont’s Recycling Program. I will help win the war on waste!’
(C)
For six weeks the researchers secretly observed the 
recycling behavior of the residents. (c) They found that 
those who had not been visited showed a 3 percent 
increase in recycling. In contrast, asking people to sign a 
pledge card resulted in a 20 percent increase. Just 
spending a few moments behaving as if (d) they intended 
to recycle had a dramatic impact on their following 
motivation to go green.
(D)
The researchers started off by getting the help of Boy 
Scouts and spent three weeks training them for the study. 
They had the Scouts rehearse reading aloud a message 
stressing the need for recycling. When (e) they were 
convinced that their highly trained Scouts were up for the 
job, the investigators sent the Scouts out to meet the 
residents.
