Unfortunately there were two competitors from different 
villages.
When the Olympics returned to Greece in 2004, every 
medal winner was given an olive wreath along with their 
medal. ( ① ) The wreaths for the marathon winners, 
however, were going to be special. ( ② ) They were going 
to come from the oldest tree in Greece. ( ③ ) Both 
claimed their tree dated back to the time of the ancient 
Olympics. ( ④ ) But neither of them was willing to cut it 
down and count the growth rings to prove it! ( ⑤ ) In the 
end the wreath for the winner of the women’s marathon 
was made from one tree and that for the men’s gold 
medalist from the other.
