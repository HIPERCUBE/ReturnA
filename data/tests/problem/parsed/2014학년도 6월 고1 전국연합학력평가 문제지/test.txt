18. 다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?
The music business is very popular, and many young 
people like you are attracted towards this industry. As 
music becomes more accessible, it is increasingly easy for 
music to be copied. Some budding musicians steal other 
people’s work by copying popular artists and presenting it in 
the market as their own work. That is why music licensing 
is important. To protect your original songs from being 
stolen and copied, you as an artist can license what you 
have made and then sell the right to use your work to 
others. Then, although someone uses your music without 
permission, you, the original artist, can still get paid. 
Licensing protects music from being stolen and preserves 
both new and older music, and this is why music licensing 
exists.

19. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Even though people who set high expectations for 
themselves tend to achieve more in a negotiation than those 
who set low goals, they are almost always less satisfied 
with their results. Why? Because when the negotiation is 
over, they compare their final outcome to their initial 
expectations and focus on what they didn't get from the deal 
and feel like they failed. To solve this problem, they need 
to learn how to change their focus after the negotiation is 
complete. They must view their results in a more positive 
manner. With this simple adjustment of focus they will 
recognize everything they were able to get in the negotiation 
and feel pleased with their work. 
① 협상 중에는 상대를 존중하라.
② 협상 전에 준비를 철저히 하라.
③ 가능한 한 높은 협상 목표를 설정하라. 
④ 협상 시 가능한 모든 대안을 고려하라.
⑤ 협상 후에는 결과를 의미있게 수용하라.
20. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? 
When you say “My car is broken,” that is not, in itself, a 
problem if you’ve got two cars. So a better statement would 
be, “I have no way to get to work today,” or “I’m going to 
be late getting to work today because my only car is broken.” 
The reason to clearly state the root problem is that your 
goal in this specific instance is not to “fix my car.” It is to 
get to work. Stating the problem in this way opens up other 
options: taking the bus, calling a friend, taking the day off, 
etc. A clear statement of the problem will help you come up 
with clear options of how to fix it.
① 문제 해결보다 예방이 더 중요하다.
② 문제가 발생하면 원인부터 파악해야 한다.
③ 문제 해결을 위해 다양한 시각에서 접근해야 한다.
④ 최선의 선택을 위해 여러 사람의 의견을 들어야 한다.
⑤ 문제를 명확히 진술하는 것이 문제 해결에 도움이 된다.
21. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
I’ll bet that if you’re in the habit of buying the morning 
paper, you skip the one directly on top of the pile. Instead, 
you lift up the top newspaper and pull out the one directly 
underneath it. Did you know that consciously or not, 72 
percent of people do the same? Why? Because we imagine 
that the second one from the top hasn’t been handled by 
countless fingertips and is therefore somehow cleaner than 
the one above it. Ironically, though, after scanning the 
headlines, many of that same 72 percent of consumers 
replace that paper right where they found it, under the top 
one. So they all end up thumbing through the same 
newspaper that has been touched over and over.
① illnesses caused by dirty fingertips
② effective ways to make the headline 
③ importance of reading various newspapers
④ positive effects of newspapers on the public
⑤ false belief of cleanliness in a pile of newspapers
22. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
In the late 1960s, a television producer, Joan Cooney, 
started an epidemic. She targeted children between three and 
five. Her agent of infection was television and the “virus” 
she wanted to spread was literacy. The show would be an 
hour long and run 5 days a week in hopes that it would 
become contagious enough to improve education. Her aim 
was to spread positive learning values to all children and 
even their parents. She also intended for it to give 
advantages to children with fewer opportunities once they 
began elementary school. What she wanted to do, in essence, 
was create a learning epidemic to fight the wide­spread 
epidemics of poverty and illiteracy. She called her idea 
Sesame Street.

② Are Children Sick of Sesame Street?
③ What Makes Sesame Street Harmful?
④ Too Much TV Time Equals Less Education
⑤ Don’t Turn on TV Too Early in the Morning!
23. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
When Susan was a young girl, her teacher Ms. Ashley 
used to encourage ① her students to drink glass after glass 
of milk. Somehow, she had developed the idea that milk 
improved one’s intellect. For ② her, there was nothing more 
precious than intelligence. On occasion, Susan would ask ③ her 
directly, “What’s intelligence?” Each time, ④ she would offer 
a different response: “Intelligence is a baby’s first words,” 
“Intelligence is yellow,” or “Intelligence is the joke Tom 
made in math class this morning.” The responses would 
drive ⑤ her crazy, and now, some thirty years later, she 
finds it interesting to consider why Ms. Ashley did so.
24. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점] 
Ying Liu wanted to stop his six­year­old son, Jing, from 
watching so much TV. He also wanted to encourage Jing to 
play the piano and ① to do more math. The first thing Ying 
did was prepare. He made a list of his son’s interests. 
It ② was included, in addition to watching TV, playing with 
Legos and going to the zoo. He then suggested to his son 
③ that he could trade TV time, piano time, and study time 
for Legos and visits to the zoo. They established a point 
system, ④ where he got points whenever he watched less 
TV. Dad and son monitored the process together. As Jing 
got points, he felt valued and good about ⑤ himself and 
spent quality time with Dad.
25. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 
적절한 것은?
Pests and diseases are part of nature. In the ideal 
system there is a natural balance between predators and 
pests. If the system is imbalanced, one population can 
(A) decrease / increase  because it is not being preyed 
upon by another. The aim of natural control is not to 
eradicate pests and diseases. It is to (B) disturb / restore  
a natural balance between pest and predator and keep 
pests and diseases down to an acceptable level. However, 
pesticides, another option to natural pest and disease 
control, do not solve the pest problem. In the past 50 
years, pesticide use has increased ten times while crop 
losses from pest damage have doubled. Here lies the 
reason why natural control is (C) avoided / chosen  more 
than pesticide use.
* eradicate: 박멸하다
(A) (B) (C)
① decrease  ‥‥‥ disturb  ‥‥‥ avoided
② decrease  ‥‥‥ restore ‥‥‥ chosen
③ increase  ‥‥‥ restore ‥‥‥ chosen
④ increase  ‥‥‥ disturb  ‥‥‥ avoided
⑤ increase  ‥‥‥ restore ‥‥‥ avoided

Iceland. ⑤ Both the male and female adult unemployment 
rates were highest in Finland, which was followed by 
Sweden.

32. New research conducted recently suggests that social 
isolation                                . When people don’t 
feel connected to their social network, they often try to 
buy satisfaction. And the more rejected people feel, the 
more likely they are to see money as a way to solve 
their problems. An experiment, which involved randomly 
approaching people in public places in Hong Kong, found that 
those who said they felt more rejected in general tended to 
report more betting on lotteries, more gambling at the horse 
track or casino, and riskier investment strategies than those 
who reported feeling more socially connected. Rejection 
increased their beliefs linking money to a better life and 
these beliefs entirely accounted for the riskier choices with 
their money.

② makes people understand others better

33. What is the difference between fines and fees? Fines 
mean moral disapproval, whereas fees are simply prices that 
imply no moral judgment. When we charge a fine for 
littering, we’re saying that littering is wrong. Tossing a beer 
can into the Grand Canyon not only charges cleanup costs. It 
reflects a bad attitude that society wants to discourage. 
Suppose the fine is $100, and a wealthy hiker decides it’s 
worth the convenience of not having to carry his empty cans 
out of the park. He _____________________________ and tosses 
his cans into the Grand Canyon. He pays up, but we think 
he’s done something wrong. By treating the Grand Canyon 
as an expensive trash can, he has failed to appreciate it 
properly. [3점]
① decides not to pay
② treats the fine as a fee
③ observes the park’s policy
④ knows the true meaning of fine
⑤ respects other visitors’ opinions
34. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
The match finished over an hour ago and there is no need 
for me to feel especially under pressure. I am tired, 
physically and emotionally, and I sit down to enjoy a cold 
drink, trying to make myself comfortable. But for some 
reason, I can’t switch off. In my mind I go over every 
decision I made. I wonder what other referees will think of 
how I did. I am concerned about having made mistakes, and 
the objections of the spectators are still ringing in my ears. 
I keep telling myself: “Forget the game,” “My colleagues and 
I agreed on everything,” “On the whole, I did a good job.” 
And yet there are still concerns despite all my efforts to 
brush them aside.
① bored and irritated ② shocked and scared
③ touched and grateful ④ worried and doubtful
⑤ relieved and satisfied
35. 다음 글에서 전체의 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? [3점]
The simplest way to define the role of the media agency 
is to take an analogy from fishing. The media agency must 
help businesses advertise their products. ‘Fish where the 
fish are’ is a maxim which applies to all areas of marketing. 
① The ‘fish’, in the analogy, are the target market. ② It is 
common sense for fishermen to go where the fish are, or 
they won’t catch anything. ③ It wouldn’t be easy to 
understand why these media agencies should attract these 
fish. ④ Likewise, companies will get nowhere marketing in 
media where none of their target market will see the 
advertisements. ⑤ Finding the best place to find the fish is 
the first strategic role of the media agency.

Yet, attach a camera to them, and suddenly we can see 
so much more.
Photography has always played an important part in our 
understanding of how the universe works. ( ① )　Although 
telescopes help us see far beyond the limits of the naked 
eye, on their own they are still limited. ( ② ) Details are 
revealed that would otherwise be invisible. ( ③ )　 Indeed, 
19th century astronomers working with the first astronomical 
cameras were astonished to discover that outer space was 
much more crowded than they had thought. ( ④ )　Their first 
photographs of the night sky showed unknown stars and 
galaxies. ( ⑤ )　Once cameras were taken on board rockets 
and orbiting satellites, they saw the universe clearly for the 
first time.

Unfortunately there were two competitors from different 
villages.
When the Olympics returned to Greece in 2004, every 
medal winner was given an olive wreath along with their 
medal. ( ① ) The wreaths for the marathon winners, 
however, were going to be special. ( ② ) They were going 
to come from the oldest tree in Greece. ( ③ ) Both 
claimed their tree dated back to the time of the ancient 
Olympics. ( ④ ) But neither of them was willing to cut it 
down and count the growth rings to prove it! ( ⑤ ) In the 
end the wreath for the winner of the women’s marathon 
was made from one tree and that for the men’s gold 
medalist from the other.

When I was eight years old and was spending a 
weekend at my aunt’s, a middle­aged man visited one 
evening. After a polite argument with my aunt, he 
devoted his attention to me.
(A) To reduce my excitement, my aunt informed me that he, 
a New York lawyer, cared nothing about them. I asked 
for the reason he still talked all the time about boats.
(B) At that time, I was excited about boats, and the visitor 
discussed the subject with me in a way that seemed to 
me particularly interesting. After he left, I spoke of him 
with enthusiasm. What a man! 
(C) My aunt answered, “Because he is a gentleman. He saw 
you were interested in boats, and he talked about the 
things he knew would interest and please you.”

Many authors feel that scientific papers must use 
complex language to sound more scientific. 
(A) Besides these issues of writing style, there are other 
barriers to clear communication that negatively affect 
your paper’s chance of publication in a top journal. Most 
journals ask that you keep the use of non­standard 
abbreviations to an absolute minimum. 
(B) They think so because they forget that they are writing 
for a wide audience, and that they should be using 
concise language. Don’t use too many words when a 
few will do, and don’t use an overly complicated word 
when a simple word will do.
(C) But many authors ignore this request without realizing 
that excessive use of abbreviations makes reading 
difficult. There is nothing wrong with spelling out words 
completely.

Three psychology professors at Newcastle University 
conducted an experiment in their department’s coffee 
area. Colleagues and students were able to help 
themselves to coffee and were asked in return to leave 
fifty cents for coffee. For ten weeks, the professors 
alternated two posters -one of flowers and one of staring 
eyes -over the area. On the weeks the eyes were 
watching them, people contributed 2.76 times more 
money than they did when the flower poster was up. In 
a similar study set on Halloween, mirrors were placed 
outside a house. Children were told to take only one 
piece of candy so that there would be plenty for 
everyone. When the mirrors reflected their images back 
at them, most children took only one piece of candy.

The anger that criticism causes can upset employees, 
family members and friends, and still not correct the 
situation which is a problem. George is the safety supervisor 
for an engineering company. One of his responsibilities is 
to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they 
are on the job in the field. He reported that whenever he 
came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he 
would tell them in a firm voice that they must follow the 
rules. As a result, the workers would do as he said, but 
right after he left, the workers would remove the hats.
He decided to try a different approach. The next time he 
found some of the workers not wearing their hard hats, he 
asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit 
properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone of 
voice that the hat was designed to protect them from 
injury. The result was increased _______________ of the 
regulation with no resentment or anger. They began to 
wear hats more often.

(A)
Psychologist Shawn Burn and his team decided to 
discover whether the foot­in­the­door technique might be 
able to promote recycling in Claremont. First the researchers 
secretly observed the recycling activity of the residents, 
identified about 200 households that didn’t recycle, and set 
out to see if (a) they could change the residents’ behavior. 
(B)
(b) They asked the Scouts to knock on the door of an 
unsuspecting participant. When the door opened they 
launched into their prepared speech about the importance of 
recycling. A few moments later the Scouts handed the 
resident a pledge card. It simply said, ‘I pledge support for 
Claremont’s Recycling Program. I will help win the war on waste!’
(C)
For six weeks the researchers secretly observed the 
recycling behavior of the residents. (c) They found that 
those who had not been visited showed a 3 percent 
increase in recycling. In contrast, asking people to sign a 
pledge card resulted in a 20 percent increase. Just 
spending a few moments behaving as if (d) they intended 
to recycle had a dramatic impact on their following 
motivation to go green.
(D)
The researchers started off by getting the help of Boy 
Scouts and spent three weeks training them for the study. 
They had the Scouts rehearse reading aloud a message 
stressing the need for recycling. When (e) they were 
convinced that their highly trained Scouts were up for the 
job, the investigators sent the Scouts out to meet the 
residents.
