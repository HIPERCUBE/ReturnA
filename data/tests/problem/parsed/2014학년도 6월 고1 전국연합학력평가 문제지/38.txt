When I was eight years old and was spending a 
weekend at my aunt’s, a middle­aged man visited one 
evening. After a polite argument with my aunt, he 
devoted his attention to me.
(A) To reduce my excitement, my aunt informed me that he, 
a New York lawyer, cared nothing about them. I asked 
for the reason he still talked all the time about boats.
(B) At that time, I was excited about boats, and the visitor 
discussed the subject with me in a way that seemed to 
me particularly interesting. After he left, I spoke of him 
with enthusiasm. What a man! 
(C) My aunt answered, “Because he is a gentleman. He saw 
you were interested in boats, and he talked about the 
things he knew would interest and please you.”
