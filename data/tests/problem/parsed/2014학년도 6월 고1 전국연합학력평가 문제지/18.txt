The music business is very popular, and many young 
people like you are attracted towards this industry. As 
music becomes more accessible, it is increasingly easy for 
music to be copied. Some budding musicians steal other 
people’s work by copying popular artists and presenting it in 
the market as their own work. That is why music licensing 
is important. To protect your original songs from being 
stolen and copied, you as an artist can license what you 
have made and then sell the right to use your work to 
others. Then, although someone uses your music without 
permission, you, the original artist, can still get paid. 
Licensing protects music from being stolen and preserves 
both new and older music, and this is why music licensing 
exists.
