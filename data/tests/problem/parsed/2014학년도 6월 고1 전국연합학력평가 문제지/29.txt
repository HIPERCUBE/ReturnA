Moringa is a plant that ranges in height from five to 
twelve meters with an open, umbrella shaped crown, straight 
trunk. Native to a tropical climate, this leafy tree can 
survive almost anywhere in the world. Clusters of white 
flowers are produced from this tree, which then develop into 
long narrow seed pods. The fruits(pods) are initially light 
green, slim and tender, eventually becoming dark green, firm 
and up to 120 cm long, depending on the variety. Moringa 
cures malnutrition, contains over­the­top quantities of a host 
of vitamins and minerals. The dried powdered leaves were 
found to contain seventeen times the calcium of milk, nine 
times the protein of yogurt, and twenty­five times the iron 
in spinach.
