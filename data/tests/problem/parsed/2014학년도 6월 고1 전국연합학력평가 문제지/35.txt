The simplest way to define the role of the media agency 
is to take an analogy from fishing. The media agency must 
help businesses advertise their products. ‘Fish where the 
fish are’ is a maxim which applies to all areas of marketing. 
① The ‘fish’, in the analogy, are the target market. ② It is 
common sense for fishermen to go where the fish are, or 
they won’t catch anything. ③ It wouldn’t be easy to 
understand why these media agencies should attract these 
fish. ④ Likewise, companies will get nowhere marketing in 
media where none of their target market will see the 
advertisements. ⑤ Finding the best place to find the fish is 
the first strategic role of the media agency.
