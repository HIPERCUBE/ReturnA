I’ll bet that if you’re in the habit of buying the morning 
paper, you skip the one directly on top of the pile. Instead, 
you lift up the top newspaper and pull out the one directly 
underneath it. Did you know that consciously or not, 72 
percent of people do the same? Why? Because we imagine 
that the second one from the top hasn’t been handled by 
countless fingertips and is therefore somehow cleaner than 
the one above it. Ironically, though, after scanning the 
headlines, many of that same 72 percent of consumers 
replace that paper right where they found it, under the top 
one. So they all end up thumbing through the same 
newspaper that has been touched over and over.
