Three psychology professors at Newcastle University 
conducted an experiment in their department’s coffee 
area. Colleagues and students were able to help 
themselves to coffee and were asked in return to leave 
fifty cents for coffee. For ten weeks, the professors 
alternated two posters -one of flowers and one of staring 
eyes -over the area. On the weeks the eyes were 
watching them, people contributed 2.76 times more 
money than they did when the flower poster was up. In 
a similar study set on Halloween, mirrors were placed 
outside a house. Children were told to take only one 
piece of candy so that there would be plenty for 
everyone. When the mirrors reflected their images back 
at them, most children took only one piece of candy.
