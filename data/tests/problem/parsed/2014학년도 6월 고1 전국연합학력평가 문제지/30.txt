30. When I was young, the last wolf in this part of the 
country was hunted down and killed. The newcomers to this 
land brought their long­held fears of the wolf with them. 
They thought, and still think, that the wolf was successful 
because he loved to kill and was good at it. To them, he 
was evil and had to be killed. They didn’t realize he failed 
more than he succeeded. He went hungry nine times out of 
ten because his prey got away. But he kept trying until he 
caught it. When he finally succeeded the tenth time with his 
force of will, he satisfied his hunger. What they saw as a 
thirst for killing was really          . That was the secret 
of his success: He never quit even with difficulty. [3점]
