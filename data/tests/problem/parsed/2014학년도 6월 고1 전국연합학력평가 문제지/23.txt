When Susan was a young girl, her teacher Ms. Ashley 
used to encourage ① her students to drink glass after glass 
of milk. Somehow, she had developed the idea that milk 
improved one’s intellect. For ② her, there was nothing more 
precious than intelligence. On occasion, Susan would ask ③ her 
directly, “What’s intelligence?” Each time, ④ she would offer 
a different response: “Intelligence is a baby’s first words,” 
“Intelligence is yellow,” or “Intelligence is the joke Tom 
made in math class this morning.” The responses would 
drive ⑤ her crazy, and now, some thirty years later, she 
finds it interesting to consider why Ms. Ashley did so.
