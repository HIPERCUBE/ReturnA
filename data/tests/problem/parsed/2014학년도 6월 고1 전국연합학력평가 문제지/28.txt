Golden poison frogs are among the largest of the poison 
dart frogs, and can reach a length of over two inches as 
adults. They are active during the day and hunt insects 
using their long tongue to pull the prey to their mouth. 
They are considered the most poisonous animals on earth. 
They do not use their poison to hunt; it is only for 
defensive purposes. As they have virtually no natural 
predators, golden poison frogs make no attempt to hide from 
larger animals, and seem to be aware that they are not 
threatened by predators. They are social animals, and live in 
groups of four to seven individuals.
