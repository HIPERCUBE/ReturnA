Many authors feel that scientific papers must use 
complex language to sound more scientific. 
(A) Besides these issues of writing style, there are other 
barriers to clear communication that negatively affect 
your paper’s chance of publication in a top journal. Most 
journals ask that you keep the use of non­standard 
abbreviations to an absolute minimum. 
(B) They think so because they forget that they are writing 
for a wide audience, and that they should be using 
concise language. Don’t use too many words when a 
few will do, and don’t use an overly complicated word 
when a simple word will do.
(C) But many authors ignore this request without realizing 
that excessive use of abbreviations makes reading 
difficult. There is nothing wrong with spelling out words 
completely.
