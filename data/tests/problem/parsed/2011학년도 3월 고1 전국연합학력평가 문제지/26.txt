26. I often hear students say that they have read certain 
books. But if I ask them some questions about the books, 
they don’t answer or they only repeat what somebody else 
has said about those books. I’m so sorry for them. They 
haven’t read those books yet. Reading is not just decoding 
the letters; it means                       . So while and 
after reading books, you should keep asking yourself what 
the author’s main idea is and what your own opinion about 
that is. If you have been reading, it means you have been 
thinking.                                  * decode: 해독하다
① memorizing the whole book
② reading many book reviews
③ coming up with your own ideas
④ knowing the outline of a book
