adrenalin. ③ When this happens, your muscles become very

why you do exercise to build up your muscles. ⑤ You are 
so frightened that you become like a stone.

The foods we eat lead to our well˗being. However, if we 
eat too much, the extra food turns to fat and is stored in 
our bodies. If we overeat regularly, we may become obese. 
Obesity refers to having too much fat in our body. It has 
many serious long˗term influences on our health, and it is 
the second leading cause of death in the United States. 
More than half of Americans are overweight ― including at 
least 1 in 5 children. Therefore, it is essential to control the 
amount of food we eat for our well b̵ eing.

24. Scientists want to know what affects our personality. 
They study pairs of identical twins who grew up in different 
surroundings, like Jim Springer and Jim Lewis. These twins 
help scientists understand the connection between 
environment and biology. Researchers at the University of 
Minnesota studied 350 sets of identical twins who did not 
grow up together. They discovered many similarities in 
their personalities. Scientists believe that personality 
characteristics such as friendliness, shyness, and fears are 
not a result of environment. These characteristics are 
probably                    .

25. We know that humans have five basic senses. Those five 
senses are: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. There 
also seems to be another ―                . People with 
this sense say that they are able to predict the future, 
sense spirits, and even read others’ minds. We have 
experienced dreams, visions, or unexplained feelings which 
tell some future events. We sometimes sense a spirit or 
presence of something or someone, too. Although scientists 
simply can’t explain these things, they happen to many 
people. That is one of the reasons why we can’t ignore this 
sense.
① common sense
② moral sense
③ sense of space
④ sixth sense
⑤ sense of art
26. I often hear students say that they have read certain 
books. But if I ask them some questions about the books, 
they don’t answer or they only repeat what somebody else 
has said about those books. I’m so sorry for them. They 
haven’t read those books yet. Reading is not just decoding 
the letters; it means                       . So while and 
after reading books, you should keep asking yourself what 
the author’s main idea is and what your own opinion about 
that is. If you have been reading, it means you have been 
thinking.                                  * decode: 해독하다

② reading many book reviews
③ coming up with your own ideas

27. I’ve played the guitar for the past three years. Everyone 
is a bit different, but practice seems to work great. I play 
eight hours a day. I play for 45 minutes to learn some new 
techniques or just play for fun, and then I take a 20˗minute 
break. I take my mind off of music completely and relax. 
When I go back to the guitar, I seem to play better and 
smoother. Remember, nothing is more important than 
practice, but you                          .
① also need a break
② should set up a goal
③ have to get enough sleep
④ should enjoy playing the guitar
⑤ need to know where to practice
28. Some animals can change the color of their bodies. The 
octopus is one of them. Usually, an octopus takes on the 
color of its surroundings. This is not so when it gets 
upset. It may get pale all over or turn brown or even 
purple. The octopus keeps on changing colors, one after 
another, until it calms down. So when you see an octopus 
under the sea, please check its color, though the chance for 
you to see one is very rare. If it is brown or purple, you’d 
better move away from it. When it goes back to normal, it

29. Chuck felt sorry about not going to a dance party with his 
friends after school, but he thought he had better prepare 
for a final exam coming up in a couple of days. So he went 
back home and studied for the exam. A few days later, his 
decision to give up having fun and study for the exam 
turned out a good one. His efforts at studying resulted in a 
high grade on the exam. His friends did not score half as 
well as he did. Chuck learned from this experience that it’s 
true that                       . With this lesson in mind, 
he always tried his best to do what he had to do.

When I was reading a book in my room, I heard a sound 
from the garden. I thought that I should go out and have a 
look. I took a flashlight and a strong walking stick. I went 
into the garden and called out “Who’s there?” But there was 
no answer. I examined the garden but there was no sign of 
anybody or anything. I went back to the house and began to 
read my book again. Just then I heard a cry of “Help! 
Help!”, this time from over my shoulder. I dropped my book 
and jumped up. There was a large green and red bird sitting 
by the window. It was a parrot!

How would you feel if your children wanted to ① imitate a 
celebrity who has a troubled private life? Maybe you would

lives. This is because you believe that celebrities should be

just want to be like the celebrities in their ③ performance 
as professionals, not in their private behavior. Actors are 
just actors and sports stars are just sports stars. They

34. Although no studies have been able to show a clear link 
between laughter and pain, many patients have reported a 
decrease in pain after a good laugh. Some doctors claim the 
decrease could be linked to chemicals produced in the blood. 
Or patients might also feel less pain because their muscles 
are more relaxed, or they simply forget their pain for a 
while. Whatever the truth may be, there are many people 
who would agree with the Groucho brothers’ claim that “A 
clown is like an aspirin.”

③ Effective use of painkillers
④ Becoming humorous people
⑤ Effects of laughter on pain
35. Have you ever wondered how movies set in the winter 
can be filmed in the summer? The answer to this question 
is special effects. Special effects help make the movies 
seem more realistic. As an example, snow is made by 
machines to create the illusion of winter in Hollywood. 
However, the viewers have no idea that the snow in the 
movie isn’t real. The 1946 holiday classic film, Wonderful 
Life, shows snow produced with special effects. The movie 
was actually filmed in the summer. Another example is rain, 
which is a bit more common than snow in Hollywood films. 
Rather than waiting around for the rain to fall, Hollywood 
creates its own.

food and goods they could not produce. Most ancient 
Egyptians worked as laborers, farmers, craftsmen, and so on.

37. Henry James에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Henry James was born in 1843 in New York. His father 
was a well˗known religious thinker, and his older brother a 
famous philosopher. James was educated in New York and 
Europe and attended Harvard Law School. His years of school 
in London, Paris, and Geneva gave him a love for Europe. He 
traveled often to Europe, and after 1876 made his home in 
London. James wrote widely. In addition to plays, critiques, 
and short stories, he wrote about twenty novels. Much of 
James’s work deals with the contrast in values of Americans 
and Europeans. He became a British citizen shortly before his 
death in 1916.

among the fuels during these ten years. ② On the other 
hand, the proportion of crude oil energy was the largest for 
the same period. ③ All the fuels, except crude oil, showed 
an increase in production between 1980 and 1985. ④ Coal 
and natural gas were always over 50 quadrillion BTU for the 
whole period. ⑤ The amount of coal energy was three times 
as much as that of hydroelectric energy in 1990.

39. Seat belts don’t fit young children and babies. Shoulder 
belts don’t properly cross their chest. Lap belts may not 
hold them in place. So you might think you can just hold 
children in a car. But when a car stops suddenly, the child’s 
body keeps moving forward. You no longer hold just the 
child’s weight. You also have to keep the child from flying 
out of your arms. This makes the child feel much heavier. It 
can feel as if the child weighs hundreds of pounds. That is 
why young children and babies should ride in child safety 
seats.

makes you feel special. It means that someone took the time 
to pick out a card just for you. Besides, it’s always fun to see 
what’s inside, and handwriting is more personal than typing. 
Getting your letter is going to make someone smile.

41. Comets are usually fairly predictable. But a normally 
small, faint comet recently did something really odd. Last 
month, Comet 17P/Holmes suddenly grew 400,000 times 
brighter than normal. However, no one expected the comet 
to get especially bright. That’s because, even at its closest, 
Comet 17P/Holmes is still twice as far from the Sun as the 
Earth is. So, it never gets much heat. Even more surprising, 
the comet’s recent brightening happened five months after 
the comet was at its closest location to the Sun.

42. Isn’t the Internet amazing? People can use it to find 
information. They can even play games. Actually, the 
Internet began in the 1960s. The United States government 
started it. The government wanted to connect computers in 
different places to share information. It was a new idea; 
people had not linked computers together before. The 
government had to figure out how. It took several years. 
Finally, four computers in different cities were linked 
together by phone lines. The computers shared information, 
and the Internet was born. Soon, more computers were 
added. Other groups wanted to join the Internet. Scientists 
linked up their computers, so did colleges and businesses. 
Later, people at home hooked up their computers, and the 
Internet became huge.

Do you ever have trouble deciding what to order at a 
restaurant? Two members of a California family had 
this problem often. They solved it by opening a ‘bite˗
size’ restaurant in Los Angeles. At this restaurant, thirty 
two small items appear on the menu. Customers can order 
small salads and very small˗sized French fries, nacho chips, 
and tacos. No bite˗sized item costs more than three dollars, 
and some cost less than a dollar. People like the restaurant 
because they do not need to choose between one favorite

(A) There lived a man in Puerto Rico who had a 
wonderful parrot. The parrot was unique; there was no 
other like him in the whole world. (a) He could learn to say 
any word ― except one. He could not say the name of his 
native town, Catano.
(B) Finally the man gave up. (b) He picked up the parrot 
and threw him into the chicken house. “You are even more 
stupid than the chickens,” he said. In the chicken house 
there were four old chickens, waiting to be killed for 
Sunday’s dinner.
(C) The next morning, the man went out to the chicken 
house. When (c) he opened the door, he was shocked by 
what he saw. (d) He could not believe his eyes and ears! 
On the floor lay three dead chickens. The parrot was 
screaming at the fourth, “Say ‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!”
(D) The man did everything (e) he could to teach the 
parrot to say “Catano,” but he never succeeded. At first he 
was very gentle with the bird, but gradually he lost his 
temper. “You stupid bird! Why can’t you learn to say that 
one word? Say ‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!” But the parrot 
would not say it. Many times the man screamed, “Say 
‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!” But the bird would not repeat the 
name.

Whales usually swim in small groups. However, on this 
day the number of whales swimming together was much 
larger. The exact number varied, but sometimes the 
group grew to more than a hundred whales. The whales 
were swimming together as they looked for one of their 
favorite foods ― codfish.
After a while, the whales followed a group of codfish into 
the bay. But they took a big risk. The bay had ice all 
around it. Suddenly, the ice moved in and blocked their way 
out to the open sea. The whales couldn’t get out of the 
bay. They were               ! 
All the whales now have to swim in a very small area 
that has no ice on it. It’s a very difficult situation for the 
whales. Whales breathe oxygen. If the ice moves closer and 
covers the water, the whales can’t come up to breathe. 
They won’t be able to get air! Will the whales be able to 
find air in time?
