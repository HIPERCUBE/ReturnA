27. I’ve played the guitar for the past three years. Everyone 
is a bit different, but practice seems to work great. I play 
eight hours a day. I play for 45 minutes to learn some new 
techniques or just play for fun, and then I take a 20˗minute 
break. I take my mind off of music completely and relax. 
When I go back to the guitar, I seem to play better and 
smoother. Remember, nothing is more important than 
practice, but you                          .
① also need a break
