I was working at a nursing home. It was late in the 
evening ① when I finished, so I ran down the street to the 
bus stop. I enjoyed the ride home and watched my fellow 
passengers ② got off at their stops. After a while, I was the 
only one ③ left on the bus. As the bus approached my stop, 
the driver called out to me, “Where do you live?” I 
explained to him ④ that I lived just up the next street. He 
then offered to drop me off outside my house. I was very 
grateful for his offer. I thanked the bus driver and walked to 
my door, ⑤ knowing that I would never forget his kindness.
