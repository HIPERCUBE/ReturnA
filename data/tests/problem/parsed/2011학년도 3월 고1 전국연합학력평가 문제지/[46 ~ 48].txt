(A) There lived a man in Puerto Rico who had a 
wonderful parrot. The parrot was unique; there was no 
other like him in the whole world. (a) He could learn to say 
any word ― except one. He could not say the name of his 
native town, Catano.
(B) Finally the man gave up. (b) He picked up the parrot 
and threw him into the chicken house. “You are even more 
stupid than the chickens,” he said. In the chicken house 
there were four old chickens, waiting to be killed for 
Sunday’s dinner.
(C) The next morning, the man went out to the chicken 
house. When (c) he opened the door, he was shocked by 
what he saw. (d) He could not believe his eyes and ears! 
On the floor lay three dead chickens. The parrot was 
screaming at the fourth, “Say ‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!”
(D) The man did everything (e) he could to teach the 
parrot to say “Catano,” but he never succeeded. At first he 
was very gentle with the bird, but gradually he lost his 
temper. “You stupid bird! Why can’t you learn to say that 
one word? Say ‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!” But the parrot 
would not say it. Many times the man screamed, “Say 
‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!” But the bird would not repeat the 
name.
