29. Chuck felt sorry about not going to a dance party with his 
friends after school, but he thought he had better prepare 
for a final exam coming up in a couple of days. So he went 
back home and studied for the exam. A few days later, his 
decision to give up having fun and study for the exam 
turned out a good one. His efforts at studying resulted in a 
high grade on the exam. His friends did not score half as 
well as he did. Chuck learned from this experience that it’s 
true that                       . With this lesson in mind, 
he always tried his best to do what he had to do. 
① you reap what you sow
② two heads are better than one
③ too many cooks spoil the broth
④ birds of a feather flock together
⑤ when in Rome do as the Romans do
