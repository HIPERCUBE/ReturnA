When you are in danger and feel afraid, your body 
automatically produces a chemical, called adrenalin, in your 
blood. ① With adrenalin in the blood system, you actually 
feel stronger and are ready to fight. ② However, when you 
are absolutely terrified, your body can produce too much 
adrenalin. ③ When this happens, your muscles become very 
hard and you find out that you can’t move at all. ④ That’s 
why you do exercise to build up your muscles. ⑤ You are
