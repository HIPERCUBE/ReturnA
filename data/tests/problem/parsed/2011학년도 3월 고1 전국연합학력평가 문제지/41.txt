41. Comets are usually fairly predictable. But a normally 
small, faint comet recently did something really odd. Last 
month, Comet 17P/Holmes suddenly grew 400,000 times 
brighter than normal. However, no one expected the comet 
to get especially bright. That’s because, even at its closest, 
Comet 17P/Holmes is still twice as far from the Sun as the 
Earth is. So, it never gets much heat. Even more surprising, 
the comet’s recent brightening happened five months after 
the comet was at its closest location to the Sun.
