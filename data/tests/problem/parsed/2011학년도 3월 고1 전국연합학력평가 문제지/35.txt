35. Have you ever wondered how movies set in the winter 
can be filmed in the summer? The answer to this question 
is special effects. Special effects help make the movies 
seem more realistic. As an example, snow is made by 
machines to create the illusion of winter in Hollywood. 
However, the viewers have no idea that the snow in the 
movie isn’t real. The 1946 holiday classic film, Wonderful 
Life, shows snow produced with special effects. The movie 
was actually filmed in the summer. Another example is rain, 
which is a bit more common than snow in Hollywood films. 
Rather than waiting around for the rain to fall, Hollywood 
creates its own.
