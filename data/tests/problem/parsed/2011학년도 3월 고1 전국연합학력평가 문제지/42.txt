42. Isn’t the Internet amazing? People can use it to find 
information. They can even play games. Actually, the 
Internet began in the 1960s. The United States government 
started it. The government wanted to connect computers in 
different places to share information. It was a new idea; 
people had not linked computers together before. The 
government had to figure out how. It took several years. 
Finally, four computers in different cities were linked 
together by phone lines. The computers shared information, 
and the Internet was born. Soon, more computers were 
added. Other groups wanted to join the Internet. Scientists 
linked up their computers, so did colleges and businesses. 
Later, people at home hooked up their computers, and the 
Internet became huge.
