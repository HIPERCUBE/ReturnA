25. We know that humans have five basic senses. Those five 
senses are: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. There 
also seems to be another ―                . People with 
this sense say that they are able to predict the future, 
sense spirits, and even read others’ minds. We have 
experienced dreams, visions, or unexplained feelings which 
tell some future events. We sometimes sense a spirit or 
presence of something or someone, too. Although scientists 
simply can’t explain these things, they happen to many 
people. That is one of the reasons why we can’t ignore this 
sense.
