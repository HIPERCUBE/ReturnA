How would you feel if your children wanted to ① imitate a 
celebrity who has a troubled private life? Maybe you would 
worry that your kids might be affected by their ② personal 
lives. This is because you believe that celebrities should be 
role models for kids in all ways. But, don’t worry! Your kids 
just want to be like the celebrities in their ③ performance 
as professionals, not in their private behavior. Actors are 
just actors and sports stars are just sports stars. They 
are just ④ uncommon people except that they have 
excellent skills in their field. They should not be expected 
to be ⑤ perfect in every way.
