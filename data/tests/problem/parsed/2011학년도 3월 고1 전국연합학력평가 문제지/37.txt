Henry James was born in 1843 in New York. His father 
was a well˗known religious thinker, and his older brother a 
famous philosopher. James was educated in New York and 
Europe and attended Harvard Law School. His years of school 
in London, Paris, and Geneva gave him a love for Europe. He 
traveled often to Europe, and after 1876 made his home in 
London. James wrote widely. In addition to plays, critiques, 
and short stories, he wrote about twenty novels. Much of 
James’s work deals with the contrast in values of Americans 
and Europeans. He became a British citizen shortly before his 
death in 1916.
