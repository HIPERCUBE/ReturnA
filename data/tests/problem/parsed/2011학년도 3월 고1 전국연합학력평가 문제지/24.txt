They study pairs of identical twins who grew up in different 
surroundings, like Jim Springer and Jim Lewis. These twins 
help scientists understand the connection between 
environment and biology. Researchers at the University of 
Minnesota studied 350 sets of identical twins who did not 
grow up together. They discovered many similarities in 
their personalities. Scientists believe that personality 
characteristics such as friendliness, shyness, and fears are 
not a result of environment. These characteristics are 
probably                    .
