Do you ever have trouble deciding what to order at a 
restaurant? Two members of a California family had 
this problem often. They solved it by opening a ‘bite˗
size’ restaurant in Los Angeles. At this restaurant, thirty 
two small items appear on the menu. Customers can order 
small salads and very small˗sized French fries, nacho chips, 
and tacos. No bite˗sized item costs more than three dollars, 
and some cost less than a dollar. People like the restaurant 
because they do not need to choose between one favorite 
food and another.

(A) There lived a man in Puerto Rico who had a 
wonderful parrot. The parrot was unique; there was no 
other like him in the whole world. (a) He could learn to say 
any word ― except one. He could not say the name of his 
native town, Catano.
(B) Finally the man gave up. (b) He picked up the parrot 
and threw him into the chicken house. “You are even more 
stupid than the chickens,” he said. In the chicken house 
there were four old chickens, waiting to be killed for 
Sunday’s dinner.
(C) The next morning, the man went out to the chicken 
house. When (c) he opened the door, he was shocked by 
what he saw. (d) He could not believe his eyes and ears! 
On the floor lay three dead chickens. The parrot was 
screaming at the fourth, “Say ‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!”
(D) The man did everything (e) he could to teach the 
parrot to say “Catano,” but he never succeeded. At first he 
was very gentle with the bird, but gradually he lost his 
temper. “You stupid bird! Why can’t you learn to say that 
one word? Say ‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!” But the parrot 
would not say it. Many times the man screamed, “Say 
‘Catano’ or I’ll kill you!” But the bird would not repeat the 
name.

Whales usually swim in small groups. However, on this 
day the number of whales swimming together was much 
larger. The exact number varied, but sometimes the 
group grew to more than a hundred whales. The whales 
were swimming together as they looked for one of their 
favorite foods ― codfish.
After a while, the whales followed a group of codfish into 
the bay. But they took a big risk. The bay had ice all 
around it. Suddenly, the ice moved in and blocked their way 
out to the open sea. The whales couldn’t get out of the 
bay. They were               ! 
All the whales now have to swim in a very small area 
that has no ice on it. It’s a very difficult situation for the 
whales. Whales breathe oxygen. If the ice moves closer and 
covers the water, the whales can’t come up to breathe. 
They won’t be able to get air! Will the whales be able to 
find air in time?
