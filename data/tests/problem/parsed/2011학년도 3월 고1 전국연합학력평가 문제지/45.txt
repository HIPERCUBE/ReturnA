Do you ever have trouble deciding what to order at a 
restaurant? Two members of a California family had 
this problem often. They solved it by opening a ‘bite˗
size’ restaurant in Los Angeles. At this restaurant, thirty 
two small items appear on the menu. Customers can order 
small salads and very small˗sized French fries, nacho chips, 
and tacos. No bite˗sized item costs more than three dollars, 
and some cost less than a dollar. People like the restaurant 
because they do not need to choose between one favorite 
food and another.
