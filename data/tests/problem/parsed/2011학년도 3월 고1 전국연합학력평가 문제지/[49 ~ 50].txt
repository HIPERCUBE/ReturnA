Whales usually swim in small groups. However, on this 
day the number of whales swimming together was much 
larger. The exact number varied, but sometimes the 
group grew to more than a hundred whales. The whales 
were swimming together as they looked for one of their 
favorite foods ― codfish.
After a while, the whales followed a group of codfish into 
the bay. But they took a big risk. The bay had ice all 
around it. Suddenly, the ice moved in and blocked their way 
out to the open sea. The whales couldn’t get out of the 
bay. They were               ! 
All the whales now have to swim in a very small area 
that has no ice on it. It’s a very difficult situation for the 
whales. Whales breathe oxygen. If the ice moves closer and 
covers the water, the whales can’t come up to breathe. 
They won’t be able to get air! Will the whales be able to 
find air in time?
