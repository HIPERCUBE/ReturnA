The graph above shows the world’s energy production 
using five primary fuels in the period between 1980 and 
1990. ① Nuclear energy always took the smallest proportion 
among the fuels during these ten years. ② On the other 
hand, the proportion of crude oil energy was the largest for 
the same period. ③ All the fuels, except crude oil, showed 
an increase in production between 1980 and 1985. ④ Coal 
and natural gas were always over 50 quadrillion BTU for the 
whole period. ⑤ The amount of coal energy was three times 
as much as that of hydroelectric energy in 1990.
