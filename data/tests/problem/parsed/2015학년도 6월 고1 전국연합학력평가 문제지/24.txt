24. leopard shark에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The leopard shark got its name because of its dark brown 
markings similar to those found in leopards. Their size is 
rather average at only 5 to 6 feet in length. These sharks 
live in the warm waters of the Eastern Pacific region. They 
may also be found in sandy bays. Their favorite foods 
include shrimps and crabs. But they will also eat fish eggs. 
The leopard shark catches its prey by generating a suction 
force as it expands its buccal cavity. It will then secure 
food using its teeth. One of the most interesting features of 
the leopard sharks is their three-pointed teeth. Like some 
sharks, female leopard sharks lay eggs and hatch them 
inside their bodies. They keep their babies for twelve 
months until live birth occurs. A single birth can produce 33 
pups. They are among the sharks which are not considered 
as a threat to humans.
