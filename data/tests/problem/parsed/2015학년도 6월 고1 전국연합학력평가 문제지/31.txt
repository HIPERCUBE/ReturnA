31. Every leader starts in his inner circle, the comfort zone. 
This is the place where we operate from what we are 
comfortable with, where we know well what we are capable 
of and can consistently achieve expected outcomes and 
results. The goal of the next zone is to push out beyond 
that area and begin to learn new things. This is known as 
the learning zone. In a new environment or area, we have to 
adapt and learn to perform in new ways. Beyond the 
learning zone lies the courage zone. In this zone, we 
continue to learn, but the learning curve is steeper because 
we are challenged to accomplish greater and more difficult 
things that take a fair amount of courage to achieve. The 
outermost circle is known as the             zone ― 
because once we have mastered the new learning and 
mustered the courage to experiment with all the new 
knowledge, we will really start to perform differently from 
before.
