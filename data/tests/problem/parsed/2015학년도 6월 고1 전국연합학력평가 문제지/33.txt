33. Friends. Can you imagine what life would be like without 
them? Who would you hang out with during lunch? Who 
would you tell about the new boy in your history class? 
Let’s face it. Without friends, the world would be a pretty 
lonely place. Although friends and friendship mean different 
things to different people, most people realize that friends 
are pretty important. While it’s fun to read what other 
people have said about friendship, what matters most is 
what you think of when you hear the word “friend.”  
has a lot to do with 
what kind of friend you are. If, for instance, you believe 
that loyalty goes hand in hand with friendship, you are 
probably a loyal friend yourself. If you believe a friend is 
someone who’ll go out of her way for you, maybe just to 
pick up a homework assignment you missed when you were 
sick, it’s likely that you’d also go out of your way for your 
friends. [3점]
