Have you been abroad? Do you travel a lot? Then you 
know what I’m talking about. Wherever you go on this globe, 
you can get along with English. Either most people speak it 
anyhow, or there is at least somebody around who can 
communicate in this language. But then, you realize that 
mostly there’s something you may find odd about the way 
English is used there. If you are abroad, English is likely to 
be somewhat different from the way you speak it. Well, if 
you stay there, wherever that is, for a while, you’ll get used 
to this. And if you stay there even longer, you may even 
pick up some of these features and begin to sound like the 
locals. What this example teaches us is: English is no longer 
just “one language.”
