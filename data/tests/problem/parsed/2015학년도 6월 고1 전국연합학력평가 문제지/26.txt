Carol was new to the United States. One of her friends 
called to invite ① her to lunch. She offered to pick her up on 
the corner of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue at 11:30 a.m. 
Carol arrived a little early and was standing on the corner 
waiting for her friend when ② she noticed a sign above her 
head. It said, “No Standing.” Carol didn’t know what to do.  
She moved away from the sign and started walking back and 
forth on the street. She was happy to see her friend arrive 
and couldn’t wait to get into ③ her car. She excitedly 
explained that it was a bad idea to meet at that corner 
because people aren’t allowed to stand there. ④ Her friend 
said, “What are you talking about? Of course you can stand 
there.” “No,” ⑤ she said, “the sign says ‘No Standing’.” Her 
friend burst into laughter. “That means we cannot park cars 
there, but we can stop to pick up passengers.”
