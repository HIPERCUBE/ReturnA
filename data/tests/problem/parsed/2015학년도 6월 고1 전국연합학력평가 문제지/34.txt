Observing a child’s play, particularly fantasy play, can be 
seen to provide particularly rich insights into a child’s 
inner world. Interpretation of what you have observed 
must,      (A)     , be made with care since the functions 
of play are complex and not fully understood. It would be 
unwise to jump to conclusions about what a child is 
communicating through it. Scenes a child acts out may give 
us clues about their past experiences, or their wishes for 
the future; these scenes may represent what has actually 
happened, what they wish would happen, or a confusion of 
events and feelings that they are struggling to make sense 
of.      (B)     , we can say that observation is a valuable 
tool to understand a child, but one that should always be 
employed with caution. [3점]
