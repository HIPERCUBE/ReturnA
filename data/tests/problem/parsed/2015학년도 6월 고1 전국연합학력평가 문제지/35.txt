Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans 
Frontier̀ es or MSF, was founded in 1971 by a small 
group of French doctors. They believed that all people 
have the right to medical care regardless of race, religion, 
gender, and political belief. ① It was the first 
non-governmental organization to provide emergency 
m  e d i cal assistance. ② A private, nonprofit organization, MSF is at the forefront of emergency health care as well 
as care for populations suffering from endemic diseases. 
③ It provides primary health care, performs surgery, runs 
nutrition programs, trains local medical personnel, and 
provides mental health care. ④ Health care, a primary 
concern of many people, is limited to developed countries. 
⑤ Through longer-term programs, this organization treats 
chronic diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, and 
AIDS; and brings health care to remote, isolated areas 
where resources and training are limited.
