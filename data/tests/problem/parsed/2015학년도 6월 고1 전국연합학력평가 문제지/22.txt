Language skills, like any other skills, can be acquired only 
through practice. In the case of the mother tongue, the child 
gets sufficient scope for this practice in his daily 
environment. And he has so many teachers: his parents, 
other members of the family, friends, relatives ― almost 
everyone with whom he comes in contact in his day-to-day 
life. He also has the strongest motivation or urge to learn 
the language, for if he cannot express himself in his mother 
tongue, some of his basic needs are likely to remain 
unfulfilled. And what is perhaps most remarkable, the child 
practices the language without being conscious of the fact 
that he is learning a highly complex code.
