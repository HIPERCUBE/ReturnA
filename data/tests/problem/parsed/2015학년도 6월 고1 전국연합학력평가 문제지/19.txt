My dog, Pinky, was a handful. But Pinky and I loved each 
other. Every day when I got off the school bus she’d bark, 
race to the end of her run and try to jump over the gate to 
greet me. That’s why I knew something was terribly wrong 
that afternoon last spring. Not a sound. Pinky’s run was 
empty. I searched the streets until my feet ached. No Pinky. 
None of my neighbors had seen her either. The next day I 
called the animal shelters. I examined the “dog found” ads in 
the paper. There were lots of them, but none matched my 
Pinky’s description. “Don’t worry,” Mom said. “We will put 
up lost dog signs and keep looking.” We checked the 
neighborhood for six days. Still Pinky didn’t turn up.
