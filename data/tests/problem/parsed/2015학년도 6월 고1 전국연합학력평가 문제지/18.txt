A number of studies have shown that the body weight and 
attitudes of a patient’s spouse can have a major impact on 
the amount of weight lost and on success in weight 
maintenance. Black & Threlfall found that overweight 
patients with normal-weight partners lost significantly more 
weight than those with overweight partners. They also noted 
that success was greater in those patients whose partners 
had also lost weight even though they were not included in 
the program, suggesting that recommended changes were 
being actively supported by the spouse. Similarly, Pratt 
found that drop-out rates were reduced when the patient’s 
spouse was included in a weight-control program.
