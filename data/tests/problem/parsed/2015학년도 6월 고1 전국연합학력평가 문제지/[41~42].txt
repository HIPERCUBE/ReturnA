On Jan. 13, 1989, the 27-year-old Italian interior 
designer, Stefania Follini, went down into a cave near 
Carlsbad, N. Mex., where she was to live for more than 
four months as part of an experiment aimed at examining 
how the stresses of long-term isolation could affect space  
travel. Pioneer Frontier Explorations, an Italian research 
foundation, had selected Follini, one of 20 volunteers for 
the assignment, because she was judged to have inner 
strength and stamina. For 131 days she lived there alone in 
a 6 meter by 12 meter Plexiglas module sealed 9 meters 
under the surface, without sunlight or any other way of 
measuring time.
After about four months, she returned aboveground on 
schedule. But by her calculations it was only mid-March. 
During Follini’s underground stay, her sense of time seemed to 
be longer. Her “day” extended to 25 hours, then to 48 hours. 
She tended to sleep for 22 to 24 hours, then burst into activity 
for up to 30 hours. In short, her                      had 
gone out of order.
