Have you ever measured the length of a room using your 
feet as the unit of measurement? Around 3,000 B.C., ancient 
Egyptians developed the cubit system of measurement. 
(A) Of course, the length of a cubit varied from person to 
person. So Egypt established a standard cubit, called 
the Royal Cubit. It was based on the length of the 
Pharaoh’s forearm. The Royal Cubit was a piece of 
black granite about 52.3 centimeters long. 
(B) It was based on the lengths of parts of the arm and 
hand, rather than the foot. The Egyptian cubit was the 
length of a forearm from the tip of the elbow to the 
end of the middle finger. The cubit was subdivided into 
smaller units of spans, palms, digits, and parts of digits.
(C) Although the royal architect kept the Royal Cubit, 
wooden copies were distributed throughout the land. 
The cubit sticks must have been very accurate, because 
the lengths of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza 
vary by only a few centimeters. [3점]
