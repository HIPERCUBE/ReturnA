We must be careful when looking at proverbs as 
expressing aspects of a certain worldview or mentality of a 
people. That is, no fixed conclusions about a so-called 
“national character” should be drawn. There are so many 
popular proverbs from classical, Biblical, and medieval 
times current in various cultures that it would be foolish to 
think of them as showing some imagined national character. 
Nevertheless, the frequent use of certain proverbs in a 
particular culture could be used together with other social 
and cultural indicators to form some common concepts. 
Thus, if the Germans really do use the proverb, 
“Morgenstunde hat Gold im Munde” (The morning hour has 
gold in its mouth) with high frequency, then it does mirror  
at least to some degree the German attitude towards 
getting up early.
