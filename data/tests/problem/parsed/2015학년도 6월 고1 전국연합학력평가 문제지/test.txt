A number of studies have shown that the body weight and 
attitudes of a patient’s spouse can have a major impact on 
the amount of weight lost and on success in weight 
maintenance. Black & Threlfall found that overweight 
patients with normal-weight partners lost significantly more 
weight than those with overweight partners. They also noted 
that success was greater in those patients whose partners 
had also lost weight even though they were not included in 
the program, suggesting that recommended changes were 
being actively supported by the spouse. Similarly, Pratt 
found that drop-out rates were reduced when the patient’s 
spouse was included in a weight-control program.

19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? 
My dog, Pinky, was a handful. But Pinky and I loved each 
other. Every day when I got off the school bus she’d bark, 
race to the end of her run and try to jump over the gate to 
greet me. That’s why I knew something was terribly wrong 
that afternoon last spring. Not a sound. Pinky’s run was 
empty. I searched the streets until my feet ached. No Pinky. 
None of my neighbors had seen her either. The next day I 
called the animal shelters. I examined the “dog found” ads in 
the paper. There were lots of them, but none matched my 
Pinky’s description. “Don’t worry,” Mom said. “We will put 
up lost dog signs and keep looking.” We checked the 
neighborhood for six days. Still Pinky didn’t turn up.
① bored and lonely ② worried and disappointed
③ excited and delighted ④ frightened and threatened
⑤ relieved and satisfied
20. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점] 
Have you been abroad? Do you travel a lot? Then you 
know what I’m talking about. Wherever you go on this globe, 
you can get along with English. Either most people speak it 
anyhow, or there is at least somebody around who can 
communicate in this language. But then, you realize that 
mostly there’s something you may find odd about the way 
English is used there. If you are abroad, English is likely to 
be somewhat different from the way you speak it. Well, if 
you stay there, wherever that is, for a while, you’ll get used 
to this. And if you stay there even longer, you may even 
pick up some of these features and begin to sound like the 
locals. What this example teaches us is: English is no longer 
just “one language.” 
① pros and cons of travelling abroad
② localization of English in different places
③ necessity for systematic English education
④ various methods to improve English ability 
⑤ how to get along with local residents abroad

On behalf of the Board of Directors and Officers of the 
Heyerdahl Corporation, I would like to express sincere 
appreciation and congratulations to Davis Construction 
Company for successfully completing the reconstruction of 
our headquarters building in Woodtown, which was destroyed 
by fire last year. Your company has distinguished itself as a 
leader in the construction industry by performing what 
appeared to be an almost impossible task. Working under 
difficult conditions and accelerated construction schedules, 
your company completed the building on June 1, as 
scheduled. This accomplishment is a result of the fine group 
of professional engineers and skilled craftsmen you 
assembled on site, and of the individual skill and dedication 
of your project manager, David Wallace.

22. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Language skills, like any other skills, can be acquired only 
through practice. In the case of the mother tongue, the child 
gets sufficient scope for this practice in his daily 
environment. And he has so many teachers: his parents, 
other members of the family, friends, relatives ― almost 
everyone with whom he comes in contact in his day-to-day 
life. He also has the strongest motivation or urge to learn 
the language, for if he cannot express himself in his mother 
tongue, some of his basic needs are likely to remain 
unfulfilled. And what is perhaps most remarkable, the child 
practices the language without being conscious of the fact 
that he is learning a highly complex code.
① Who Can We Call the Best Teacher?
② Where Can We Learn Foreign Languages?
③ Why Is Motivation Important in Learning?
④ How Complex Are the Language Structures?
⑤ What Helps the Child Acquire a Mother Tongue?
23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? 
The Internet is wonderful in so many different ways. It 
has transformed the way we live. We can contact people 
instantly, wherever they are. We can plan things together, 
without ever needing to meet. We have access to a world of 
information at the click of a mouse. But on the other hand, 
the Internet glues us to our computer monitors and isolates 
us from our fellow human beings. We will now e-mail 
someone a message, rather than call them up or walk ten 
yards to the next office to say hello. We need to create a 
balance between the World Wide Web and the real wide 
world we live in. Turn your computer off for one day a 
week, leave your laptop at home, get out into the real world 
and live your life.

24. leopard shark에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The leopard shark got its name because of its dark brown 
markings similar to those found in leopards. Their size is 
rather average at only 5 to 6 feet in length. These sharks 
live in the warm waters of the Eastern Pacific region. They 
may also be found in sandy bays. Their favorite foods 
include shrimps and crabs. But they will also eat fish eggs. 
The leopard shark catches its prey by generating a suction 
force as it expands its buccal cavity. It will then secure 
food using its teeth. One of the most interesting features of 
the leopard sharks is their three-pointed teeth. Like some 
sharks, female leopard sharks lay eggs and hatch them 
inside their bodies. They keep their babies for twelve 
months until live birth occurs. A single birth can produce 33 
pups. They are among the sharks which are not considered 
as a threat to humans.
* buccal cavity: 입속, 구강
① 표범과 유사한 흑갈색 무늬가 있다.
② 좋아하는 먹이에는 새우와 게가 있다.

⑤ 인간에게 위협적이지 않다고 여겨진다.

Carol was new to the United States. One of her friends 
called to invite ① her to lunch. She offered to pick her up on 
the corner of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue at 11:30 a.m. 
Carol arrived a little early and was standing on the corner 
waiting for her friend when ② she noticed a sign above her 
head. It said, “No Standing.” Carol didn’t know what to do.  
She moved away from the sign and started walking back and 
forth on the street. She was happy to see her friend arrive 
and couldn’t wait to get into ③ her car. She excitedly 
explained that it was a bad idea to meet at that corner 
because people aren’t allowed to stand there. ④ Her friend 
said, “What are you talking about? Of course you can stand 
there.” “No,” ⑤ she said, “the sign says ‘No Standing’.” Her 
friend burst into laughter. “That means we cannot park cars 
there, but we can stop to pick up passengers.”

31. Every leader starts in his inner circle, the comfort zone. 
This is the place where we operate from what we are 
comfortable with, where we know well what we are capable 
of and can consistently achieve expected outcomes and 
results. The goal of the next zone is to push out beyond 
that area and begin to learn new things. This is known as 
the learning zone. In a new environment or area, we have to 
adapt and learn to perform in new ways. Beyond the 
learning zone lies the courage zone. In this zone, we 
continue to learn, but the learning curve is steeper because 
we are challenged to accomplish greater and more difficult 
things that take a fair amount of courage to achieve. The 
outermost circle is known as the             zone ― 
because once we have mastered the new learning and 
mustered the courage to experiment with all the new 
knowledge, we will really start to perform differently from 
before. 
* muster: 발휘하다
① fairness ② performance     ③ diligence
④ morality ⑤ consistency
32. In a study of 500 marriages, one researcher determined that 
marital success is more closely linked to                     
than to any other factor. Above all, get rid of distractions: 
the TV, the Internet, and e-mail. What you and your spouse 
need is quality time to talk. My wife and I have some of 
our best talks on our evening walks. A quiet drive can work 
wonders too. One hardworking couple I know regularly gets 
together for lunch. They know it’s essential. A marriage 
without time to communicate is a marriage headed over a 
cliff. How can you settle differences if you don’t honestly 
talk them out? And it’s not just talking. It’s listening. As a 
counselor, I’ve listened to people for hours. The results are 
incredible. I’ve seen people move from total confusion to total 
clarity just because I listened to them. Something powerful 
happens inside most people when they are listened to. 
① average income ② health management
③ outdoor activities ④ counselor assistance
⑤ communication skills
33. Friends. Can you imagine what life would be like without 
them? Who would you hang out with during lunch? Who 
would you tell about the new boy in your history class? 
Let’s face it. Without friends, the world would be a pretty 
lonely place. Although friends and friendship mean different 
things to different people, most people realize that friends 
are pretty important. While it’s fun to read what other 
people have said about friendship, what matters most is 
what you think of when you hear the word “friend.”  
has a lot to do with 
what kind of friend you are. If, for instance, you believe 
that loyalty goes hand in hand with friendship, you are 
probably a loyal friend yourself. If you believe a friend is 
someone who’ll go out of her way for you, maybe just to 
pick up a homework assignment you missed when you were 
sick, it’s likely that you’d also go out of your way for your 
friends. [3점]
① A shared experience with friends
② Your personality that needs improvement
③ Your own personal definition of friendship
④ The way of talking and listening to others
⑤ The honesty between you and your friends

Observing a child’s play, particularly fantasy play, can be 
seen to provide particularly rich insights into a child’s 
inner world. Interpretation of what you have observed 
must,      (A)     , be made with care since the functions 
of play are complex and not fully understood. It would be 
unwise to jump to conclusions about what a child is 
communicating through it. Scenes a child acts out may give 
us clues about their past experiences, or their wishes for 
the future; these scenes may represent what has actually 
happened, what they wish would happen, or a confusion of 
events and feelings that they are struggling to make sense 
of.      (B)     , we can say that observation is a valuable 
tool to understand a child, but one that should always be 
employed with caution. [3점]
(A)    (B)
① however …… Moreover
② however …… Therefore
③ in other words …… For example
④ in other words …… Therefore
⑤ otherwise …… For example

Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans 
Frontier̀ es or MSF, was founded in 1971 by a small 
group of French doctors. They believed that all people 
have the right to medical care regardless of race, religion, 
gender, and political belief. ① It was the first 
non-governmental organization to provide emergency 
m  e d i cal assistance. ② A private, nonprofit organization, MSF is at the forefront of emergency health care as well 
as care for populations suffering from endemic diseases. 
③ It provides primary health care, performs surgery, runs 
nutrition programs, trains local medical personnel, and 
provides mental health care. ④ Health care, a primary 
concern of many people, is limited to developed countries. 
⑤ Through longer-term programs, this organization treats 
chronic diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, and 
AIDS; and brings health care to remote, isolated areas 
where resources and training are limited.

There are many situations where other people try to 
influence our mood by changing the atmosphere of the 
environment; probably you have already done the same. 
(A) The low-level light of the candle puts her in a relaxed 
spirit. And finally, romantic music does the rest to 
make the wife willing to accept the husband’s apology 
for the mistake. 
(B) For example, let us imagine that a man is in the 
unfortunate situation where he forgot his wedding 
anniversary. The man tries to rescue the situation by 
preparing a self-cooked, candlelit dinner for his wife 
with romantic background music.
(C) Whether or not he is aware of it, a candlelit dinner is a

Have you ever measured the length of a room using your 
feet as the unit of measurement? Around 3,000 B.C., ancient 
Egyptians developed the cubit system of measurement. 
(A) Of course, the length of a cubit varied from person to 
person. So Egypt established a standard cubit, called 
the Royal Cubit. It was based on the length of the 
Pharaoh’s forearm. The Royal Cubit was a piece of 
black granite about 52.3 centimeters long. 
(B) It was based on the lengths of parts of the arm and 
hand, rather than the foot. The Egyptian cubit was the 
length of a forearm from the tip of the elbow to the 
end of the middle finger. The cubit was subdivided into 
smaller units of spans, palms, digits, and parts of digits.
(C) Although the royal architect kept the Royal Cubit, 
wooden copies were distributed throughout the land. 
The cubit sticks must have been very accurate, because 
the lengths of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza 
vary by only a few centimeters. [3점]

Other research, however, suggests that, as a whole, 
women may feel more stress than men.
Fundamental differences may exist between men and 
women. ( ① ) Perhaps as a child you remember going to 
your mother when you broke that garage window with a 
baseball. ( ② ) You went to your mother instead of your 
father, because mom would be less likely to be upset. ( ③ ) 
A study at Ohio State University found that women’s blood 
pressure rises less than men’s in response to an objective 
stressor. ( ④ ) Ronald Kessler did a Harvard study and 
found that women feel stress more often because they 
generally take a more far-reaching view of life. ( ⑤ ) For 
example, women may worry about many things at a time, 
while many men can classify their worries, dealing with only 
one problem or stressor before moving on to the next one.

The researchers found that even when the students knew 
the solution to the first problem, the vast majority did not 
think to apply a similar solution to the second problem.
Students may not spontaneously bring their prior 
knowledge to bear on new learning situations. ( ① ) It is 
important to help students activate prior knowledge so they 
can build on it productively. ( ② ) Indeed, research 
suggests that even small instructional interventions can 
activate students’ relevant prior knowledge to positive effect. 
( ③ ) For instance, in one famous study by Gick and 
Holyoak, college students were presented with two problems 
that required them to apply a certain mathematical concept. 
( ④ ) However, when the instructor suggested to students 
that they think about the second problem in relation to the 
first, 80 percent of the student participants were able to

We must be careful when looking at proverbs as 
expressing aspects of a certain worldview or mentality of a 
people. That is, no fixed conclusions about a so-called 
“national character” should be drawn. There are so many 
popular proverbs from classical, Biblical, and medieval 
times current in various cultures that it would be foolish to 
think of them as showing some imagined national character. 
Nevertheless, the frequent use of certain proverbs in a 
particular culture could be used together with other social 
and cultural indicators to form some common concepts. 
Thus, if the Germans really do use the proverb, 
“Morgenstunde hat Gold im Munde” (The morning hour has 
gold in its mouth) with high frequency, then it does mirror  
at least to some degree the German attitude towards 
getting up early.

On Jan. 13, 1989, the 27-year-old Italian interior 
designer, Stefania Follini, went down into a cave near 
Carlsbad, N. Mex., where she was to live for more than 
four months as part of an experiment aimed at examining 
how the stresses of long-term isolation could affect space  
travel. Pioneer Frontier Explorations, an Italian research 
foundation, had selected Follini, one of 20 volunteers for 
the assignment, because she was judged to have inner 
strength and stamina. For 131 days she lived there alone in 
a 6 meter by 12 meter Plexiglas module sealed 9 meters 
under the surface, without sunlight or any other way of 
measuring time.
After about four months, she returned aboveground on 
schedule. But by her calculations it was only mid-March. 
During Follini’s underground stay, her sense of time seemed to 
be longer. Her “day” extended to 25 hours, then to 48 hours. 
She tended to sleep for 22 to 24 hours, then burst into activity 
for up to 30 hours. In short, her                      had 
gone out of order.

(A)
When my wife, Rebecca, was a junior at Madison High 
School in Idaho, a sign-up sheet for the Madison Talent 
Contest was passed around in class. She, along with many 
other students, signed up. Linda, who sat next to (a) her, 
passed the sheet without signing it. “Sign up, Linda,” 
insisted Rebecca. “Oh, no. I couldn’t do that.” “Come on. It 
will be fun.” “No, really. I’m not the type.” “Sure you are. I 
think you’d be great!” said Rebecca.
(B)
But, like Rebecca, the director insisted that Linda 
participate. Reluctantly, she agreed. Linda noted that 
although she hadn’t won a single title or award, she had 
overcome an even bigger obstacle: her low perception of 
herself. In her letter, Linda thanked Rebecca from deep 
within for, in essence, taking off (b) her warped glasses, 
shattering them against the floor, and insisting she try on a 
new pair of glasses. 
* warped: 뒤틀린
(C)
Rebecca and others continued to encourage Linda until she 
finally signed up. Rebecca didn’t think anything of the 
situation at the time. However, seven years later, she 
received a letter from Linda describing the inner struggle 
(c) she had gone through that day and thanking Rebecca for 
being the spark that helped her change her life. 
(D)
Linda wrote how she suffered from a poor self-image in high 
school and was shocked that Rebecca would consider (d) her a 
candidate for the contest. She had finally agreed to sign up just 
to get Rebecca and the others off her back. Linda said she was 
so uncomfortable about being in the contest that (e) she 
contacted the contest director the following day and demanded 
her name be removed from the list.
