On behalf of the Board of Directors and Officers of the 
Heyerdahl Corporation, I would like to express sincere 
appreciation and congratulations to Davis Construction 
Company for successfully completing the reconstruction of 
our headquarters building in Woodtown, which was destroyed 
by fire last year. Your company has distinguished itself as a 
leader in the construction industry by performing what 
appeared to be an almost impossible task. Working under 
difficult conditions and accelerated construction schedules, 
your company completed the building on June 1, as 
scheduled. This accomplishment is a result of the fine group 
of professional engineers and skilled craftsmen you 
assembled on site, and of the individual skill and dedication 
of your project manager, David Wallace.
