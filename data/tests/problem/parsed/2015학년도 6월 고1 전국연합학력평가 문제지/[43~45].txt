(A)
When my wife, Rebecca, was a junior at Madison High 
School in Idaho, a sign-up sheet for the Madison Talent 
Contest was passed around in class. She, along with many 
other students, signed up. Linda, who sat next to (a) her, 
passed the sheet without signing it. “Sign up, Linda,” 
insisted Rebecca. “Oh, no. I couldn’t do that.” “Come on. It 
will be fun.” “No, really. I’m not the type.” “Sure you are. I 
think you’d be great!” said Rebecca.
(B)
But, like Rebecca, the director insisted that Linda 
participate. Reluctantly, she agreed. Linda noted that 
although she hadn’t won a single title or award, she had 
overcome an even bigger obstacle: her low perception of 
herself. In her letter, Linda thanked Rebecca from deep 
within for, in essence, taking off (b) her warped glasses, 
shattering them against the floor, and insisting she try on a 
new pair of glasses. 
* warped: 뒤틀린
(C)
Rebecca and others continued to encourage Linda until she 
finally signed up. Rebecca didn’t think anything of the 
situation at the time. However, seven years later, she 
received a letter from Linda describing the inner struggle 
(c) she had gone through that day and thanking Rebecca for 
being the spark that helped her change her life. 
(D)
Linda wrote how she suffered from a poor self-image in high 
school and was shocked that Rebecca would consider (d) her a 
candidate for the contest. She had finally agreed to sign up just 
to get Rebecca and the others off her back. Linda said she was 
so uncomfortable about being in the contest that (e) she 
contacted the contest director the following day and demanded 
her name be removed from the list.
