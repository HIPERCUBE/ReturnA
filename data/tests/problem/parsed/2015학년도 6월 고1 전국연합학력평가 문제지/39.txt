39. 
The researchers found that even when the students knew 
the solution to the first problem, the vast majority did not 
think to apply a similar solution to the second problem.
Students may not spontaneously bring their prior 
knowledge to bear on new learning situations. ( ① ) It is 
important to help students activate prior knowledge so they 
can build on it productively. ( ② ) Indeed, research 
suggests that even small instructional interventions can 
activate students’ relevant prior knowledge to positive effect. 
( ③ ) For instance, in one famous study by Gick and 
Holyoak, college students were presented with two problems 
that required them to apply a certain mathematical concept. 
( ④ ) However, when the instructor suggested to students 
that they think about the second problem in relation to the 
first, 80 percent of the student participants were able to 
solve it. ( ⑤ ) In other words, with minor prompts and 
simple reminders, instructors can activate relevant prior 
knowledge so that students draw on it more effectively.
