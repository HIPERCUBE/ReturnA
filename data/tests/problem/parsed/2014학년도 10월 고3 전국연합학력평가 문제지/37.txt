Years ago, when I was working with dogs in Europe, I 
witnessed an intelligence test given by some of the 
foremost trainers and behaviorists in the field. 
(A) I, on the other hand, concluded the poodle was the 
smartest of all the dogs tested. When confronted with 
this obstacle, he analyzed the situation and chose the 
easiest way of achieving the goal of getting to the 
other side of the wall ― he simply walked around it! 
(B) The test involved having various breeds of dog 
negotiate a high wall in order to get to the other side. 
Dog after dog jumped over the wall. Finally, it was the 
standard poodle’s turn. The poodle stood there for a 
moment, as if to size up the obstacle in front of him. 
(C) Then he casually walked around the wall and joined his 
fellow competitors on the other side of it. These 
so­called experts concluded that the poodle had failed 
the test ― he hadn’t possessed the intelligence to jump 
over it.
