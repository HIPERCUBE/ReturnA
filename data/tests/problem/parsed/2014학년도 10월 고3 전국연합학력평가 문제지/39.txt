Traits, on the other hand, are more stable characteristics 
that endure across time.
Psychologists make the distinction between dispositions, or 
traits, and states, or momentary feelings. ( ① ) Think of 
some moments of happiness or despair you have 
experienced, such as when you won a prize or got an 
exciting job offer, or when somebody died. ( ② ) These 
experiences are states of happiness or sadness; they reflect 
the transient highs and lows of everyday life. ( ③ ) These 
are the emotional styles or ways of thinking that remain 
fairly steadfast across our lives. ( ④ ) Mary has “Mary­like” 
characteristics that remain fairly stable, just as Dave stays 
“Dave­like” under all circumstances. ( ⑤ ) Cheerful, happy 
babies tend to become adventurous, outgoing children who 
tend to become extroverted, sociable adults.
