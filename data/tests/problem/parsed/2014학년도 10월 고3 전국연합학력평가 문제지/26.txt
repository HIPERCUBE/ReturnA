100 Years in the Life of the Family Budget
The graph above shows the changes in the percentage of 
spending on five components in the American family budget 
for about a century from 1900 to 2003. ① During the whole 
period, the proportion of spending on food dropped most 
sharply and it took up less than 15 percent in 2003. ② On 
the other hand, the percentage of spending on housing 
increased steadily, and in 2003 it eventually surpassed the 
percentage of spending on food. ③ In the case of apparel, 
the percentage steadily decreased during the period, and it 
was the second smallest among the five components in 
2003. ④ For half a century from 1900 to 1950, the 
proportion of spending on health care remained the same, 
and then it rose to about 6 percent in 2003. ⑤ From 1950
