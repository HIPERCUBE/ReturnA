Dear Ms. Brooks,
We hope you and your family are well. According to 
our records, you have not been in for your regular 
checkup. Your last checkup was on April 1st. We 
understand life gets busy but we hope you will take 
the time to call and schedule an appointment. Regular 
dental exams are the best way to avoid gum disease, 
cavities and bad breath. Since you have been our loyal 
client for a long time, we would like to offer you a 
10% discount off your next exam. Please call us and 
we will schedule you right away. We look forward to 
seeing you soon! You can reach us at 812-863-1012 
or email us at kwilson@goodmail.com.
Sincerely,
Kenneth Wilson
