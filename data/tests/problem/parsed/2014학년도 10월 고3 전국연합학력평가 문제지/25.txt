25. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
In most wilderness, the majority of groups ① visiting the 
area are small ― usually between two and four people. But 
large groups do visit wilderness, and their potential to 
disturb campsites differs from ②that of small groups. 
Although the effect of party size on campsites has never been 
formally studied, it makes sense that a large group can cause 
impacts on an undisturbed site more ③rapidly than a small 
group. For example, along the New River in West Virginia, 
the area of vegetation loss on sites used by large commercial 
rafting companies ④were more than four times larger than 
the area on sites used by small groups of fishermen. At 
well­established campsites, however, a big group need not be 
a problem, as long as activities are ⑤ confined within the 
boundaries of the existing site.
