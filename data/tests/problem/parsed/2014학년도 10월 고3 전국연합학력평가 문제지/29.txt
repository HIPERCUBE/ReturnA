Benny Tee was one of my very good friends. He ran a 
retail shoe store near my house. Two weeks before Christmas 
a poor man walked into Benny’s store. Looking around at all 
the shoes, he asked, “Are you Mr. Tee?” and Benny said, 
“Yes.” “I want a special pair of shoes for ① my son.” 
Standing next to him was an eleven­year­old boy dressed in 
shabby clothes. Benny looked down at the boy’s feet and 
saw that ② he had club feet. His father explained, “The one 
thing my son wants for Christmas is a pair of shoes like the 
other kids. Could you make them for ③ him?” Benny said, 
“Yes, but it will take time to order a special kind of leather 
to make shoes for ④ him. I can’t promise they’ll be done by 
Christmas.” The leather didn’t come until the 24th. It took 
Benny until 4:00 in the morning of Christmas Day to complete 
his work. But when ⑤ he kindly delivered the special pair of 
shoes to the boy’s home, Benny Tee received the best 
Christmas gift of his life. He received Joy.
