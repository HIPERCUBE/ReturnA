36. The tongue map was based on German research published 
in 1901, but Edwin Boring, an influential Harvard 
psychologist, mistranslated it. ① What the original research 
had shown was that the human tongue has areas of relative 
sensitivity to different tastes, but his translation stated that 
each could only be tasted in one zone. ② What is really 
mysterious about the tongue map is that it was the official 
truth for such a long time, even though it’s so easily 
disproved. ③ The sense of taste is related to the sense of 
smell and that is why we can’t detect tastes well when we 
have a runny nose. ④ It wasn’t until 1974 that another 
American scientist, Dr. Virginia Collings, reexamined the 
original theory. ⑤ She showed that, though sensitivity to the 
four main tastes did vary around the tongue, it was only to 
an insignificant degree.
