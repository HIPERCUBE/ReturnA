(A)
Tom was a strong­willed, competitive, hardworking 
businessman, who for thirty years ran a neighborhood 
hardware store. At the age of 58, poor health forced him 
to sell his business. His routine became one of turning 
on the television, pouring a bowl of chips, and spending 
the day in his favorite chair. His friend Don came by to 
see how (a) he was doing. He found his friend gaining 
weight, with a dark complexion and a very bad attitude.
(B)
“Have you gone crazy?” Tom asked, “How is a 
thirteen­year­old going to react to your crazy outfit?” 
“We’ll see,” Don said. At the hospital, Tom helped to 
serve ice cream while (b) he watched his friend do magic 
tricks and talk to patients. He paid special attention to 
Robert, the thirteen­year­old boy who had been active in 
junior high athletics. Don challenged the boy to a game of 
“hangman.” During the entire game, (c) he peppered the 
boy with all kinds of riddles, puns, and jokes. By the 
time he was finished, the boy was smiling happily.
(C)
On the way back to Tom’s house, a thoughtful silence 
enveloped the two men. As they pulled to a stop, Tom 
asked, “How can I get involved?” Two months later, Tom 
and Don were sharing “Hospital Clown” experiences. Tom 
learned that bringing joy and happiness into the hearts of 
patients brought (d) him great rewards. He regained his 
feeling of self­worth and made many new friends. The 
hospital nutritionist taught him better eating habits and 
he lost his unwanted weight. He developed a healthy, 
positive outlook towards the future.
(D)
Don invited Tom to accompany him to visit a 
thirteen­year­old boy in the hospital, who was scheduled 
for surgery the next morning. Reluctantly, Tom accepted 
the invitation. They stopped by Don’s house on the way 
to the hospital. As Tom drank coffee, Don disappeared. 
What emerged minutes later gave (e) him a shock; Don 
was now “Dr. Hick­up,” a hospital clown. Don’s costume 
was composed of an oversized stethoscope, a CD disk 
strapped to his orange wig, and complete clown make­up.
