The dog’s natural tendency to memorize landmarks can 
actually hinder training. Younger dogs are so good at 
learning locations that they often spontaneously memorize 
their surroundings as part of the set of cues that tells them 
to do something. (A) , puppies taught the verbal 
command “sit” in a training class may appear to have 
forgotten it as soon as they get home ― because, in addition 
to the command, they have spontaneously memorized as the 
relevant cue some feature of the room where the class was 
held and, in different surroundings, do not recognize the 
command. (B) , many dog trainers repeat a training 
exercise in a variety of places, in order to break such 
associations and isolate the intended cue, in this case, the 
verbal command alone.
