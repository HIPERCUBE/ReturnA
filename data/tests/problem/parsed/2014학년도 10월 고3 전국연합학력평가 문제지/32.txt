32. Subjective well­being is at least partly temporary in 
response to the consumption of new and novel consumer 
goods. Pleasure has a stable component dependent on the 
accustomed consumption flows, but it also has a component 
that is dependent on change. Once the change occurs and 
the new consumer item becomes a part of the daily 
consumption bundle, the pleasure of novelty disappears and 
overall satisfaction returns to the original amount. A new 
kind of cereal at breakfast will temporarily add to our 
pleasure, but eventually our enjoyment of breakfast will 
return to its normal level. Also, as our incomes and material 
standards rise, so do our expected achievements. The 
purchase of a second automobile made possible by rising 
income increases our subjective well­being, but at the same 
time our aspirations rise and a second car becomes a part of 
our consumption expectations.                               
returns our subjective well­being to its normal amount. [3점]
