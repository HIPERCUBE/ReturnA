In one study, fourteen­month­olds watched an adult 
experimenter bend over and activate a light by pressing the 
button with her head. For some of the infants, the adult’s 
hands were bound by a blanket. The babies were then given 
the light switch to play with. Infants who saw the adult 
whose arms were bound activated the light switch with their 
hand because they understood that the adult was unable to 
use their hands. However, if they were the ones who saw 
that the adult’s hands were free, then the infants bent over 
and activated the button with their head, too. They must 
have reasoned that it was important to use the head and not 
the hands. Infants were not simply copying the actions but 
rather repeating the intended goal.
