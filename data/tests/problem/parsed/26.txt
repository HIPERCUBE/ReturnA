Marcia is a creativity coach. One day an amateur artist 
came to see her because she had difficulty creating 
imaginatively. The client always wanted to have a detailed 
plan of her work before ① she could begin. Marcia offered a 
number of approaches but the client couldn’t commit to them. 
Finally, ② she asked her client to play with her painting 
tools for thirty minutes every day for a week with 
absolutely no plan in mind. ③ She asked for more direction 
but Marcia told her there were no specific directions. This 
was so far out of her comfort zone, but ④ she did play and 
had a breakthrough. Without a plan in mind, ⑤ she created a 
piece that she liked.
