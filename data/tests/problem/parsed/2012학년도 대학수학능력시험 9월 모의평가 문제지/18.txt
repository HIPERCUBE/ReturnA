So, you’re ready to add a new member, a furry one, to 
your family. But now you have one more decision to 
make: What kind of dog should I get? Here are some tips 
to consider when choosing a dog that is right for you. 
First, pick a dog that fits your home. Bring a big one into 
your house only if you can give him a lot of space. 
Second, don’t buy a shaggy dog if you’re allergic. Getting 
a non-shedding dog is a good idea if you’re worried about 
loose hairs or your kids’ allergies. Third, pick a 
mild-mannered puppy that is likely to be more forgiving 
and protective of his little owners. Keep these in mind, 
and you’ll enjoy having the new member at home.
