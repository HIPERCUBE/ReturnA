One reason why the definitions of words have 
changed over time is simply because of their misuse. 
There are a growing number of examples where the 
incorrect meaning of relatively commonplace language 
has become more widespread than the original intention 
or definition.  
(A) Now, imagine that an angry customer sent you a letter 
about the service he received in one of your stores. If 
your reply is that you ‘perused his letter,’ he is likely 
to get even more angry than he was before.
(B) The word ‘peruse’ is one of them. Most people think 
that to ‘peruse’ something means to ‘scan or skim it 
quickly, without paying much attention.’ In fact, this is 
the exact opposite of what ‘peruse’ really means: ‘to 
study or read something carefully, in detail.’
(C) But the word has been misused so often by so many 
people, that this second sense of it― the exact 
opposite of what it actually means― has finally been 
accepted as a secondary definition and as far as most 
people know, it is the only definition.
