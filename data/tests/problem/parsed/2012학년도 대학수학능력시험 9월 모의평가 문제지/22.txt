Albert Einstein sought relentlessly for a so-called unified 
field theory― a theory capable of describing nature’s forces 
within a single, all-encompassing, coherent framework. ①
Einstein was not motivated by the things we often associate 
with scientific undertakings, such as trying to explain this or 
that piece of experimental data. ② Instead, he was driven by 
a passionate belief that the deepest understanding of the 
universe would reveal its truest wonder: the simplicity and 
power of the principles on which it is based. ③ As in 
Einstein’s formulation, the two theories underlying the 
tremendous progress of physics were mutually incompatible.
④ Einstein wanted to illuminate the workings of the 
universe with a clarity never before achieved, allowing us 
all to stand in awe of its sheer beauty and elegance. ⑤ In 
his day, however, Einstein never realized this dream, mainly 
because a number of essential features of matter and the 
forces of nature were either unknown or, at best, poorly 
understood.
