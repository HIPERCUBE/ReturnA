40. In a study conducted by Karen O’Quinn and Joel 
Aronoff, participants were asked to negotiate with a seller 
over the purchase price of a piece of art. Toward the end 
of the negotiation, the seller made a final offer in one of 
two ways. Half of the time he said that he would accept 
$6,000, while the other half of the time he gave the same 
final price but also added a little humor (“Well, my final 
offer is $6,000, and I’ll throw in my pet frog”). Those few 
moments of attempted humor had a large effect, as 
participants made a much greater compromise in their 
purchase price when they heard about the frog. It seemed 
that the brief humorous comment momentarily put the 
participants in a good mood and encouraged them to be 
more giving.
