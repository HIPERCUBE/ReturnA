35. Despite the fact that ancient civilizations relied upon the 
apparent motion of celestial bodies through the sky to 
determine seasons, months, and years, we know little about 
the details of timekeeping in prehistoric eras. But wherever 
we turn up records and artifacts, we usually discover that in 
every culture, some people were preoccupied with measuring 
the passage of time. Ice-age hunters in Europe over 20,000 
years ago scratched lines and made holes in sticks and 
bones, possibly counting the days between phases of the 
moon. Five thousand years ago, Sumerians in the 
Tigris-Euphrates valley had a calendar that divided the year 
into 30 day months, and the day into 12 periods. We have 
no written records of Stonehenge, built over 4,000 years ago 
in England, but its alignments show its purposes apparently 
included the determination of seasonal or celestial events.
