28. The essence of science is to uncover patterns and 
regularities in nature by finding algorithmic compressions 
of observations. But the raw data of observation rarely 
exhibit explicit regularities. Instead we find that nature’s 
order is hidden from us, it is written in code. To make 
progress in science we need to crack the cosmic code, to 
dig beneath the raw data and uncover the hidden order. I 
often liken fundamental science to doing a crossword 
puzzle. Experiment and observation provide us with 
clues, but the clues are cryptic, and require some 
considerable ingenuity to solve. With each new solution, 
. As with a crossword, so 
with the physical universe, we find that the solutions to 
independent clues link together in a consistent and 
supportive way to form a coherent unity, so that the 
more clues we solve, the easier we find it to fill in the 
missing features. [3점] 
* cryptic: 비밀스러운
① the depth of scientific experiments keeps us in awe
② we glimpse a bit more of the overall pattern of nature
③ the code-breaking process becomes increasingly mysterious
④ the regularity of nature is revealed in its entirety to 
the observer
⑤ we crack the cosmic codes one by one, replacing an 
old solution with the new one
