So, you’re ready to add a new member, a furry one, to 
your family. But now you have one more decision to 
make: What kind of dog should I get? Here are some tips 
to consider when choosing a dog that is right for you. 
First, pick a dog that fits your home. Bring a big one into 
your house only if you can give him a lot of space. 
Second, don’t buy a shaggy dog if you’re allergic. Getting 
a non-shedding dog is a good idea if you’re worried about 
loose hairs or your kids’ allergies. Third, pick a 
mild-mannered puppy that is likely to be more forgiving 
and protective of his little owners. Keep these in mind, 
and you’ll enjoy having the new member at home.

Switching on the light in the nursery, Evelyn found her 
baby daughter, Julie, tossing feverishly and giving out odd 
little cries. ① She put her hand against Julie’s cheeks. They 
were burning. With an exclamation, she followed ② her 
baby’s arm down under the cover until she found her little 
hand. The whole thumb was swollen to the wrist and in the 
center was a little inflamed sore. ③ She rushed to the 
phone. Doctor Foulke, the family physician, sounded upset at 
being called out of bed at midnight. She ran back to the 
nursery to check on her daughter. Taking a closer look, she 
found ④ her thumb to be somewhat more swollen. ⑤ She 
knelt beside the bed and began smoothing back Julie’s hair 
over and over.

You have to pay close attention to someone’s normal 
pattern in order to notice a deviation from it when he or she 
lies. Sometimes the variation is as (A) subtle / subtly  as a 
pause. Other times it is obvious and abrupt. I recently saw a 
news interview with an acquaintance (B) who / whom  I was 
certain was going to lie about a few particularly sensitive 
issues, and lie she did. During most of her interview she was 
calm and direct, but when she started lying, her manner 
changed dramatically: she threw her head back, laughed in 
‘disbelief,’ and shook her head back and forth. It is true that 
the questions (C) dealt / dealing  with very personal issues, 
but I have found that in general, no matter how touchy the 
question, if a person is telling the truth his or her manner 
will not change significantly or abruptly.
(A) (B) (C)
① subtle …… who …… dealt
② subtle …… who …… dealing
③ subtle …… whom …… dealt
④ subtly …… who …… dealt
⑤ subtly …… whom …… dealing

Fieldwork is the hallmark of cultural anthropology. It is the 
way we explore and learn about the vast ① detailed intricacy 
of human culture and individual behavior. And it is, 
importantly, the way ② in which most cultural anthropologists 
earn and maintain their professional standing. Some of the 
early personal accounts of anthropologists in the field make 
fieldwork ③ sound exciting, adventuresome, certainly exotic, 
sometimes easy. Malinowski, the classic anthropological 
fieldworker, describes the early stages of fieldwork as ‘a strange, 
sometimes unpleasant, sometimes intensely interesting 
adventure which soon ④ adopts quite a natural course.’ He 
goes on to describe his daily routine of strolling through the 
village ⑤ observed the intimate details of family life, and as 
he tells it, such observations seem possible and accessible.
22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Albert Einstein sought relentlessly for a so-called unified 
field theory― a theory capable of describing nature’s forces 
within a single, all-encompassing, coherent framework. ①
Einstein was not motivated by the things we often associate 
with scientific undertakings, such as trying to explain this or 
that piece of experimental data. ② Instead, he was driven by 
a passionate belief that the deepest understanding of the 
universe would reveal its truest wonder: the simplicity and 
power of the principles on which it is based. ③ As in 
Einstein’s formulation, the two theories underlying the 
tremendous progress of physics were mutually incompatible.
④ Einstein wanted to illuminate the workings of the 
universe with a clarity never before achieved, allowing us 
all to stand in awe of its sheer beauty and elegance. ⑤ In 
his day, however, Einstein never realized this dream, mainly 
because a number of essential features of matter and the 
forces of nature were either unknown or, at best, poorly 
understood.
23. 다음 글에서 지도자에 관하여 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 
적절한 것은?
Effective leaders set the tone for the entire organization. 
It’s not a matter of knowing more than everyone else. There 
are plenty of leaders who are not the biggest experts in their 
companies. But it does mean working hard, something anyone 
can do. Be the first person to arrive at the workplace and be 
the last one to leave. If you can do that, you will already be 
light years ahead of most managers in the respect you will 
gain from your team members. Apply the same principle to all 
your routine activities. If you expect your sales force to make 
50 calls each day, make 100 calls yourself. It is not rocket 
science. It is just basic ‘lead by example’ management. No 
one can really discredit leaders who are the hardest-working 
individuals in their organizations.

24. Science is making the future, and nations are busy 
making future scientists. The more science that emerges 
from this investment, the greater the need for us to follow 
the gist of the science with sufficient understanding. In 
other words, if we the ordinary people are to keep pace 
with science, we need more science writers, and more 
science writing that is clear, wise and eloquent, and that 
demands to be read. People often feel excluded from 
science, convinced that it takes an advanced degree to 
understand what scientists do. As a result, they defensively 
shrug off the whole business as an exclusive realm of little 
relevance to their lives. One of the surest cures for 
scientific is great scientific literature, 
writing that does not merely translate technical terms into 
plain English or explain complicated ideas simply. 
① intolerance ② immorality ③ illiteracy
④ irregularity ⑤ manipulation
25.  . If I assign fifty students a 
five-page essay on the subject of why the Roman Empire 
fell, most of them are likely to say it was a combination 
of economic and social causes ultimately leading to a 
weakening of the frontiers. This would be a fine answer, 
but after reading forty-five papers all saying the same 
thing, I’m ready for a change. If you can take a different 
angle from the rest of the class in a paper, you’re more 
likely to impress your professors. But here’s the tricky 
part― being different is risky, and it only works if you 
back up your argument very well. If you choose to argue 
that Rome fell solely because Christianity weakened the 
fighting spirit of the Romans, you will need persuasive 
reasoning and arguments against any potential objections.
① Variety is the spice of life
② The essence of writing is in its brevity
③ Don’t fix what is not broken
④ The pen is mightier than the sword
⑤ Rome was not built in a day
26. Consumers of different age groups obviously have very 
different needs and wants. Although people who belong to 
the same age group differ in many other ways, they do tend 
to share a set of values and common cultural experiences 
that they carry throughout life. In some cases, marketers 
initially develop a product to attract one age group and then 
try to . That is what the 
high-octane energy drink Reddox does. The company 
aggressively introduced it in bars, nightclubs, and gyms to 
the product’s core audience of young people. Over time, it 
became popular in other contexts, and the company began 
to sponsor the PGA European Tour to expand its reach to 
older golfers. It also hands out free cans to commuters, cab 
drivers, and car rental agencies to promote the drink as a 
way to stay alert on the road. [3점]
① raise its retail price
② broaden its appeal later on
③ upgrade it for other age groups
④ increase demand by limiting supply
⑤ create a positive image via the mass media
27. is aggravated by the 
overabundance of information at our disposal. While this 
is obvious enough in some realms― for example, 
consider how much information is potentially relevant for 
estimating the value of Microsoft stock― even when the 
information set seems less cluttered, information overload, 
a state of confusion and decision avoidance, can still 
occur. In one experiment, shoppers in a supermarket 
were presented with free samples of jams and jellies. In 
the first treatment, a small selection was available for 
tasting; in the second, a large selection was available. 
While everyone likes the idea of abundant choice, and 
indeed the table with the greater selection attracted larger 
crowds, it was the table with fewer samples that led to 
the most sales. The likely reason is that the large 
selection led to information overload, the feeling that the 
decision was too complicated for immediate action.
① Difficulty in assessing information
② The shortage of trustworthy informants
③ Mental fatigue caused by misleading information
④ Indeterminacy arising from indirect information
⑤ The complexity of altering consumer behavior
28. The essence of science is to uncover patterns and 
regularities in nature by finding algorithmic compressions 
of observations. But the raw data of observation rarely 
exhibit explicit regularities. Instead we find that nature’s 
order is hidden from us, it is written in code. To make 
progress in science we need to crack the cosmic code, to 
dig beneath the raw data and uncover the hidden order. I 
often liken fundamental science to doing a crossword 
puzzle. Experiment and observation provide us with 
clues, but the clues are cryptic, and require some 
considerable ingenuity to solve. With each new solution, 
. As with a crossword, so 
with the physical universe, we find that the solutions to 
independent clues link together in a consistent and 
supportive way to form a coherent unity, so that the 
more clues we solve, the easier we find it to fill in the 
missing features. [3점] 
* cryptic: 비밀스러운
① the depth of scientific experiments keeps us in awe
② we glimpse a bit more of the overall pattern of nature
③ the code-breaking process becomes increasingly mysterious
④ the regularity of nature is revealed in its entirety to 
the observer
⑤ we crack the cosmic codes one by one, replacing an 
old solution with the new one

29. Like an artist who pursues both enduring excellence and 
shocking creativity, great companies foster a (A)   
between continuity and change. On the one hand, they 
adhere to the principles that produced success in the first 
place, yet on the other hand, they continually evolve, 
modifying their approach with creative improvements and 
intelligent adaptation. But the point here is not as simple as 
“some companies failed because they did not change.” 
Companies that change constantly but without any consistent 
rationale will (B)  just as surely as those that change 
not at all. There is nothing inherently wrong with 
adhering to specific practices and strategies. But you should 
comprehend the underlying why behind those practices, and 
thereby see when to keep them and when to change them.
(A) (B)
① tension …… collapse
② tension …… prosper
③ balance …… flourish
④ divergence …… succeed
⑤ divergence …… perish
30. Since most of you are working on a word processor, it 
seems silly to spend too much time on spelling. Your 
word-processing program will spell check items for you.
(A) , spelling is not a completely lost art. There 
are words that are not in the spell checker’s dictionary. 
Also, your spell checker will not help you if you 
misspell a word and mistakenly turn it into another word. 
(B) , when you write ‘lightening’ instead of 
‘lightning,’ the program will not recognize the error. So, get 
in the habit of rereading your work and looking up words 
that the spell checker does not pick up. You need to 
develop the skill of knowing when words look wrong. 
Never hand something in until you have checked it.
(A) (B)
① However …… For example
② However …… Therefore
③ That is …… Similarly
④ In addition …… For example
⑤ In addition …… Therefore
31. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
It was the day of the audition. I hadn’t slept a wink the 
previous night. Strangely, I wasn’t tired. It could have been the 
adrenaline pumping through my veins, or maybe it was the 
five cups of coffee I drank that morning. Either way, I couldn’t 
sit still. I kept getting up and down from my chair, pacing 
around the room. A dozen thoughts went through my head. 
Would I remember my lines? Would I be able to display the 
right emotions? I kept telling myself to relax but the butterflies 
in my stomach had an intention of their own. When my name 
was called, I slowly stepped in front of the judges. Their gaze 
fell heavy upon me. My mind drew a complete blank.
① jealous ② satisfied ③ sympathetic
④ angry ⑤ nervous


37. Sveta Bogoroditsa에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The church ‘Sveta Bogoroditsa’ (‘Holy Virgin’) in 
Karlovo has a handsome profile with its blue and white 
bell tower. The bell tower is relatively new, from 1897, but 
the church building, as the inscription above the western 
entrance tells us, dates from 1851. Before they began 
constructing this new building in 1847, the older church of 
the Holy Virgin had burned down in 1813. This latter 
church, about which little is known, is believed by some to 
have been built already at the end of the fifteenth century, 
at the time of the founding of the little town of Karli-ova, 
later Karlovo. In any case, the names of priests serving in 
the church have been preserved from the eighteenth century 
on. Although the construction was completed in 1851, the 
events of the Crimean War and lack of funds delayed the 
furnishing of the church, and its consecration did not take 
place until May 20, 1858.
* consecration: 헌당(식)
① 윤곽선이 아름다우며 흑색 종탑을 가지고 있다. 
② 교회 건물보다 먼저 세워진 종탑이 있다.  
③ Karli-ova 마을이 세워질 무렵 화재로 타 버렸다.
④ 봉직한 사제들의 이름이 18세기부터 보존되어 있다.
⑤ 1851년 건물 완공과 동시에 모든 비품을 갖추었다.
38. Edwin Armstrong에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Edwin Armstrong, who first discovered and developed FM 
radio in the 1920s and early 1930s, is often considered the 
most prolific and influential inventor in radio history. He 
alone understood the impact of De Forest’s vacuum tube, and 
he used it to invent an amplifying system that enabled radio 
receivers to pick up distant signals. Armstrong’s innovations 
rendered useless the enormous alternators used for generating 
power in early radio transmitters. In 1922, he sold a ‘super’ 
version of his circuit to Radio Corporation of America (RCA) 
for $200,000 and sixty thousand shares of RCA stock, 
making him a millionaire as well as RCA’s largest private 
stockholder. Armstrong also worked on the major problem of 
radio reception― electrical interference. Between 1930 and 
1933, the inventor filed five patents on FM.
* alternator: 교류발전기
① 라디오 역사상 가장 영향력 있는 발명가로 여겨지곤 한다.
② 전파 수신기로 하여금 원거리 신호를 잡게 해주는 증폭 장치를 
발명했다.
③ 그의 혁신적 장치들로 인하여 초기 전파 송신기에 사용되던 
거대한 교류발전기가 필요 없어졌다.
④ 1922년에 자신의 고성능 회로를 RCA에 기증했다.
⑤ 1930년부터 1933년 사이에, FM에 관한 5개의 특허를 출원했다.

39. Despite what you might think, luck isn’t a matter of fate 
or destiny, according to research by psychologist Richard 
Wiseman. Instead, it’s a result of the way lucky people 
think and act―which means that anyone can learn to be 
lucky! For instance, Wiseman found that lucky people 
always take notice of what’s going on around them and stay 
open to new experiences and opportunities. Meanwhile, 
unlucky people tend to be tenser and too focused on certain 
tasks, which stops them from noticing opportunities they 
aren’t explicitly looking for. So, next time you’re heading 
to a party, don’t go in with a goal in mind (no matter how 
much you want to attract someone). Instead, take things as 
they come and you never know what might happen. You 
could even make some awesome new friends.
① 열린 사고와 행동은 행운을 불러온다.
② 열정과 몰입은 행운을 부르는 지름길이다.
③ 행동하기 전에 생각하는 습관이 필요하다.
④ 운명에 도전하면 좋은 기회가 오기 마련이다.
⑤ 새로운 친구들을 사귀다 보면 이상형을 만나기 쉽다.
40. In a study conducted by Karen O’Quinn and Joel 
Aronoff, participants were asked to negotiate with a seller 
over the purchase price of a piece of art. Toward the end 
of the negotiation, the seller made a final offer in one of 
two ways. Half of the time he said that he would accept 
$6,000, while the other half of the time he gave the same 
final price but also added a little humor (“Well, my final 
offer is $6,000, and I’ll throw in my pet frog”). Those few 
moments of attempted humor had a large effect, as 
participants made a much greater compromise in their 
purchase price when they heard about the frog. It seemed 
that the brief humorous comment momentarily put the 
participants in a good mood and encouraged them to be 
more giving.
① 상대를 존중하면 가격 협상이 쉽게 이루어진다.
② 예상 구매자의 성향파악이 중요하다.
③ 거래의 성사를 위해 적절한 가격 제시가 필요하다.
④ 유머를 사용하면 협상을 유리하게 이끌 수 있다.
⑤ 신중한 협상 자세는 이익을 극대화시킨다.

41. The green revolution was a mixed blessing. Over time 
farmers came to rely heavily on broadly adapted, high-yield 
crops to the exclusion of varieties adapted to local 
conditions. Monocropping vast fields with the same 
genetically uniform seeds helps boost yield and meet 
immediate hunger needs. Yet high-yield varieties are also 
genetically weaker crops that require expensive chemical 
fertilizers and toxic pesticides. The same holds true for 
high-yield livestock breeds, which often require expensive 
feed and medicinal care to survive in foreign climates. The 
drive to increase production is pushing out local varieties, 
diluting livestock’s genetic diversity in the process. As a 
result, the world’s food supply has become largely 
dependent on a shrinking list of breeds designed for 
maximum yield. In short, in our focus on increasing the 
amount of food we produce today, we have accidentally put 
ourselves at risk for food shortages in the future.
① Pros and Cons of Using Chemical Fertilizers
② Is Genetic Diversity a Blessing in Disguise?
③ Who Will Conquer Famine, Farmers or Scientists?
④ Livestock Diseases: A Never-ending Struggle
⑤ Farming Uniform Breeds: A Double-edged Sword
42. About twenty years ago, Time magazine described a 
study by a psychologist of people who had lost their jobs 
three times due to plant closings. The writers were amazed 
by what they discovered. They expected the people being 
laid off to be beaten down and discouraged. Instead they 
found them to be incredibly resilient. Why was that? They 
concluded that people who had weathered repeated 
adversity had learned to bounce back. People who had lost 
a job and found a new one twice before were much better 
prepared to deal with adversity than someone who had 
always worked at the same place and had never faced 
adversity. It may sound ironic, but if you have experienced 
a lot of failure, you are actually in a better position to 
achieve success than people who have not.

One reason why the definitions of words have 
changed over time is simply because of their misuse. 
There are a growing number of examples where the 
incorrect meaning of relatively commonplace language 
has become more widespread than the original intention 
or definition.  
(A) Now, imagine that an angry customer sent you a letter 
about the service he received in one of your stores. If 
your reply is that you ‘perused his letter,’ he is likely 
to get even more angry than he was before.
(B) The word ‘peruse’ is one of them. Most people think 
that to ‘peruse’ something means to ‘scan or skim it 
quickly, without paying much attention.’ In fact, this is 
the exact opposite of what ‘peruse’ really means: ‘to 
study or read something carefully, in detail.’
(C) But the word has been misused so often by so many 
people, that this second sense of it― the exact 
opposite of what it actually means― has finally been 
accepted as a secondary definition and as far as most 
people know, it is the only definition.

The smartest of our deep ancestors would have stored 
their excess meat in the bodies and minds of others 
(not just their own kin).
Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that the 
absence of any effective form of refrigeration was critical 
to our early moral development. Let’s say that you’re an 
early humanoid hunting and gathering on the African 
savannah and you strike it lucky. ( ① ) You come 
across a huge beast and you manage to kill it. ( ② ) It 
yields far more meat than anyone involved in the hunt or 
their families can possibly consume. ( ③ ) How do you 
get the most benefit of your excess meat without a fridge, 
or anywhere to store it? ( ④ ) Provided those benefiting 
from your gift could possibly repay your generosity in the 
future, that was the best thing you could do with excess 
meat. ( ⑤ ) Groups of early humans who developed 
stable relationships and practiced this sort of mutual 
altruism were in a better position to prosper and multiply.

A bumper sticker reading “Don’t Believe Everything 
You Think” is placed on the edge of the whiteboard in 
Greene’s office. It represents the underlying message of 
the book he is writing. An analogy carried throughout 
the book compares the moral brain to a camera with 
automatic settings for taking a picture of a mountain or 
an indoor portrait or a close-up of a flower, and manual 
settings for unusual conditions or when we want a 
nonstandard artistic effect. Greene believes emotions and 
intuitions are the auto settings for our morality while 
reasoning is the manual mode.
We need our intuitions to make the millions of quick 
judgments that fill our lives from day to day or else we 
could not function. But they are not always trustworthy 
moral indicators, since they were set to handle problems 
deep in our evolutionary past and are often useless for 
the newer complexities of the modern world. We need to 
rely on our manual settings, the reasoning sections of our 
brain, for more complex or novel situations, Greene says.

(A)
I grew up in a small town in northern California, 
between wide-open ranchland and dark forests, feeling at 
home in two places: the wild land and books. I read 
constantly, hungrily, and without direction, collecting a 
strange stew of facts and ideas about the rest of the 
world. I longed for a world away from what I knew 
and outrageously outside my means.
(B)
The important lesson I learned at (a) Billups― the world 
was a lot bigger than I had imagined it to be― was a little 
painful. It meant I was a lot smaller than I’d realized. I 
went on to attend a state university and I began to write 
about my disappearing dreams and new dreams, about 
wishing and disappointment and feeling small. One day a 
professor (b) there took hold of me and said, “You’re a 
writer.” Until then, I hadn’t really known. I had to figure 
out who I was not going to be before I could get on to 
who I was. The lesson from Billups lay below the surface, 
but when I began to write, it rose like flowers and bloomed 
into words and stories and books, and me.
(C)
One morning I came across a catalog for a college 
preparatory school called Billups Academy. (c) It had a 
summer program and offered scholarships for high 
school students to ‘deepen and extend their intellectual, 
aesthetic, and moral interests.’ I applied for and won a 
scholarship. Billups wasn’t just another school― it was 
another world. I was used to big skies, wild water, 
snakes and horses, and solitude. What waited for me in 
(d) this new world was tree-lined avenues, brick 
buildings with white pillars, and a wood-paneled library.
(D)
Unlike back at home, in (e) the new school, I was no 
longer the smartest kid in the classroom. I wasn’t the most 
talented, or the least. Before going to Billups, one of my 
dreams was to become a photographer. That dream came to 
an abrupt halt in a photography class. There was no 
denying in the other students’ pictures that they were far 
more talented than I was. I became severely depressed as 
one dream after another faded from me. Then, on the last 
night of the summer program, it hit me. I had been blind 
to a lesson that was staring at me in the face.

[49～50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
The McDonald’s restaurants that are located across the 
United States― and, increasingly, the world― have a 
significance that goes far beyond the convenience of quick 
hamburgers, milk shakes, and salads. As sociologist George 
Ritzer says, our everyday lives are being ‘McDonaldized.’
The McDonaldization of society does not refer just to 
the robotlike assembly of food. This term refers to the 
standardization of everyday life, a process that is transforming 
our lives. Want to do some shopping? Shopping malls offer 
one-stop shopping in controlled environments. Planning a 
trip? Travel agencies offer ‘package’ tours. They will 
transport middle-class Americans to ten European capitals 
in fourteen days. All visitors experience the same hotels, 
restaurants, and other scheduled sites.
Efficiency brings dependability. You can expect your 
burger and fries to taste the same whether you buy them 
in Los Angeles or Beijing. Although efficiency also lowers 
prices, it does come at a cost. Predictability washes away 
spontaneity, changing the quality of our lives. It produces 
a sameness, a bland version of what used to be unique 
experiences. In my own travels, for example, had I taken 
packaged tours I never would have had the eye-opening 
experiences that have added so much to my appreciation of 
human diversity. For good or bad, our lives are being 
McDonaldized, and the predictability of packaged settings 
seems to be our social destiny. Our coming prepackaged 
society will be , of course. But it also means 
that we will be trapped in the ‘iron cage’ of bureaucracy
― just as Weber warned would happen.
