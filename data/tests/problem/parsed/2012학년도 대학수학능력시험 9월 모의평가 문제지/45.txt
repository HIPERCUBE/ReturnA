A bumper sticker reading “Don’t Believe Everything 
You Think” is placed on the edge of the whiteboard in 
Greene’s office. It represents the underlying message of 
the book he is writing. An analogy carried throughout 
the book compares the moral brain to a camera with 
automatic settings for taking a picture of a mountain or 
an indoor portrait or a close-up of a flower, and manual 
settings for unusual conditions or when we want a 
nonstandard artistic effect. Greene believes emotions and 
intuitions are the auto settings for our morality while 
reasoning is the manual mode.
We need our intuitions to make the millions of quick 
judgments that fill our lives from day to day or else we 
could not function. But they are not always trustworthy 
moral indicators, since they were set to handle problems 
deep in our evolutionary past and are often useless for 
the newer complexities of the modern world. We need to 
rely on our manual settings, the reasoning sections of our 
brain, for more complex or novel situations, Greene says.

(A)
I grew up in a small town in northern California, 
between wide-open ranchland and dark forests, feeling at 
home in two places: the wild land and books. I read 
constantly, hungrily, and without direction, collecting a 
strange stew of facts and ideas about the rest of the 
world. I longed for a world away from what I knew 
and outrageously outside my means.
(B)
The important lesson I learned at (a) Billups― the world 
was a lot bigger than I had imagined it to be― was a little 
painful. It meant I was a lot smaller than I’d realized. I 
went on to attend a state university and I began to write 
about my disappearing dreams and new dreams, about 
wishing and disappointment and feeling small. One day a 
professor (b) there took hold of me and said, “You’re a 
writer.” Until then, I hadn’t really known. I had to figure 
out who I was not going to be before I could get on to 
who I was. The lesson from Billups lay below the surface, 
but when I began to write, it rose like flowers and bloomed 
into words and stories and books, and me.
(C)
One morning I came across a catalog for a college 
preparatory school called Billups Academy. (c) It had a 
summer program and offered scholarships for high 
school students to ‘deepen and extend their intellectual, 
aesthetic, and moral interests.’ I applied for and won a 
scholarship. Billups wasn’t just another school― it was 
another world. I was used to big skies, wild water, 
snakes and horses, and solitude. What waited for me in 
(d) this new world was tree-lined avenues, brick 
buildings with white pillars, and a wood-paneled library.
(D)
Unlike back at home, in (e) the new school, I was no 
longer the smartest kid in the classroom. I wasn’t the most 
talented, or the least. Before going to Billups, one of my 
dreams was to become a photographer. That dream came to 
an abrupt halt in a photography class. There was no 
denying in the other students’ pictures that they were far 
more talented than I was. I became severely depressed as 
one dream after another faded from me. Then, on the last 
night of the summer program, it hit me. I had been blind 
to a lesson that was staring at me in the face.

[49～50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
The McDonald’s restaurants that are located across the 
United States― and, increasingly, the world― have a 
significance that goes far beyond the convenience of quick 
hamburgers, milk shakes, and salads. As sociologist George 
Ritzer says, our everyday lives are being ‘McDonaldized.’
The McDonaldization of society does not refer just to 
the robotlike assembly of food. This term refers to the 
standardization of everyday life, a process that is transforming 
our lives. Want to do some shopping? Shopping malls offer 
one-stop shopping in controlled environments. Planning a 
trip? Travel agencies offer ‘package’ tours. They will 
transport middle-class Americans to ten European capitals 
in fourteen days. All visitors experience the same hotels, 
restaurants, and other scheduled sites.
Efficiency brings dependability. You can expect your 
burger and fries to taste the same whether you buy them 
in Los Angeles or Beijing. Although efficiency also lowers 
prices, it does come at a cost. Predictability washes away 
spontaneity, changing the quality of our lives. It produces 
a sameness, a bland version of what used to be unique 
experiences. In my own travels, for example, had I taken 
packaged tours I never would have had the eye-opening 
experiences that have added so much to my appreciation of 
human diversity. For good or bad, our lives are being 
McDonaldized, and the predictability of packaged settings 
seems to be our social destiny. Our coming prepackaged 
society will be , of course. But it also means 
that we will be trapped in the ‘iron cage’ of bureaucracy
― just as Weber warned would happen.
