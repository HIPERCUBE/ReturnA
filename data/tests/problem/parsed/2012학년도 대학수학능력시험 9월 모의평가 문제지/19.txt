Switching on the light in the nursery, Evelyn found her 
baby daughter, Julie, tossing feverishly and giving out odd 
little cries. ① She put her hand against Julie’s cheeks. They 
were burning. With an exclamation, she followed ② her 
baby’s arm down under the cover until she found her little 
hand. The whole thumb was swollen to the wrist and in the 
center was a little inflamed sore. ③ She rushed to the 
phone. Doctor Foulke, the family physician, sounded upset at 
being called out of bed at midnight. She ran back to the 
nursery to check on her daughter. Taking a closer look, she 
found ④ her thumb to be somewhat more swollen. ⑤ She 
knelt beside the bed and began smoothing back Julie’s hair 
over and over.
