39. Despite what you might think, luck isn’t a matter of fate 
or destiny, according to research by psychologist Richard 
Wiseman. Instead, it’s a result of the way lucky people 
think and act―which means that anyone can learn to be 
lucky! For instance, Wiseman found that lucky people 
always take notice of what’s going on around them and stay 
open to new experiences and opportunities. Meanwhile, 
unlucky people tend to be tenser and too focused on certain 
tasks, which stops them from noticing opportunities they 
aren’t explicitly looking for. So, next time you’re heading 
to a party, don’t go in with a goal in mind (no matter how 
much you want to attract someone). Instead, take things as 
they come and you never know what might happen. You 
could even make some awesome new friends.
