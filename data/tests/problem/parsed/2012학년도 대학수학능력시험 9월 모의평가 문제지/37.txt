37. Sveta Bogoroditsa에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The church ‘Sveta Bogoroditsa’ (‘Holy Virgin’) in 
Karlovo has a handsome profile with its blue and white 
bell tower. The bell tower is relatively new, from 1897, but 
the church building, as the inscription above the western 
entrance tells us, dates from 1851. Before they began 
constructing this new building in 1847, the older church of 
the Holy Virgin had burned down in 1813. This latter 
church, about which little is known, is believed by some to 
have been built already at the end of the fifteenth century, 
at the time of the founding of the little town of Karli-ova, 
later Karlovo. In any case, the names of priests serving in 
the church have been preserved from the eighteenth century 
on. Although the construction was completed in 1851, the 
events of the Crimean War and lack of funds delayed the 
furnishing of the church, and its consecration did not take 
place until May 20, 1858.
