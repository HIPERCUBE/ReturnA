27. is aggravated by the 
overabundance of information at our disposal. While this 
is obvious enough in some realms― for example, 
consider how much information is potentially relevant for 
estimating the value of Microsoft stock― even when the 
information set seems less cluttered, information overload, 
a state of confusion and decision avoidance, can still 
occur. In one experiment, shoppers in a supermarket 
were presented with free samples of jams and jellies. In 
the first treatment, a small selection was available for 
tasting; in the second, a large selection was available. 
While everyone likes the idea of abundant choice, and 
indeed the table with the greater selection attracted larger 
crowds, it was the table with fewer samples that led to 
the most sales. The likely reason is that the large 
selection led to information overload, the feeling that the 
decision was too complicated for immediate action.
