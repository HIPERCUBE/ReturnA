25. I scheduled a meeting with a client for 8:00 one 
morning. I called the day before to confirm the date and 
time. When I arrived at the client’s office the morning of 
the meeting, he looked puzzled. “What are you doing here? 
Didn’t you get my message?” he asked. Here’s what 
happened: My client worked late the evening before trying 
to prepare for our meeting. Realizing he wouldn’t be ready, 
he sent me an e-mail at 8:30 p.m., telling me that we 
needed to reschedule. I have a life, and I usually don’t 
read e-mails in the evening. If he had called, I would have 
known not to show up. This is a classic case of someone 
sending an e-mail without thinking of the best way to 
deliver the message to the reader. ________________________
① He should have phoned me.
② I must have read the e-mail.
③ He must have worked overnight.
④ He could have sent an e-mail to me.
⑤ I should have rescheduled the meeting.
