(A)
There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his 
sons to learn not to judge things too quickly. So (a) he 
sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a 
pear tree that was a great distance away. 
(B)
The man then explained to his sons that they were all 
right because they had each seen only one season in the 
tree’s life. (b) He said, “You should not judge a tree by 
only one season. The same is true of people’s lives. A 
person’s life can only be measured at the end, when all 
the seasons are up. Therefore, sons, don’t give up when 
it’s winter. If you do, you will miss the promise of 
your spring, the beauty of your summer, and the 
fulfillment of your fall.”
(C)
The first son (c) he sent in the winter, the second in 
the spring, the third in the summer, and the youngest 
son in the fall. When they had all gone and come back, 
(d) he called them together to describe what they had 
seen.
(D)
The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and 
twisted. The second son said it was covered with green 
buds and full of promise. The third son disagreed; (e) he 
said it was filled with blossoms that smelled so sweet 
and looked so beautiful. The last son disagreed with all 
of them; he said it was ripe and bending with fruit, full 
of life and fulfillment.
