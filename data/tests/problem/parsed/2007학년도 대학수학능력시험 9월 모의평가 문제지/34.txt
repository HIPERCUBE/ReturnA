34. When scientists use a device called a calorimeter, the 
piece of food to be measured is placed inside the device, 
sealed, and then burned. The energy from the food heats 
the water surrounding the chamber. By weighing the 
amount of water heated, noting the increase in the water 
temperature, and multiplying the two, the energy capacity 
of the food can be measured. For example, if 10 liters of 
water surrounding the chamber is 20 degrees centigrade 
before combustion and then is measured at 25 degrees after 
combustion, the difference in temperature (5 degrees) is 
multiplied by the volume of water (10 liters) to arrive at 
the caloric value (50 calories of energy).
