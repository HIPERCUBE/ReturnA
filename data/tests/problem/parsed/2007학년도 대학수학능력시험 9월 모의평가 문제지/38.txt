I was thrilled when your establishment moved into our 
neighborhood. I appreciate the convenience that your 
family-run business provides. Your store is always clean 
and well-stocked, and your workers are always attentive 
and knowledgeable. But I would like to bring one 
consideration to your attention, and that is the cost of your 
merchandise. I realize that a family-run business will be 
more expensive than a chain store, and I’ve been willing to 
pay that difference. Frequently, however, your prices are 
nearly double what I would have paid at other stores. I 
want to continue shopping at your store, but I’m not sure I 
can consistently afford to pay such high prices.
