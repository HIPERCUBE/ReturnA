[49~50] 두 사람의 대립된 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Person A We must switch to “daylight savings.” By 
starting the day one hour earlier in the summer, people 
gain an hour of daylight, which gives them a longer day 
for either work or leisure. Saving energy is another 
advantage of setting the clock forward. With more 
sunlight late in the day, we can cut down on the use of 
electricity to be spent on lighting and air-conditioning, 
for example. Also, this new system helps the economy 
because people would _______________ for leisure 
activities, shopping, and eating out in the evening. Most 
of the world’s economic powers are on this system 
already, so it would be more convenient for international 
trade and communication. Just from these points alone, 
you can see why we should switch to this system. 
Person B We must stick to our current time system 
because the side effects of switching the clock back and 
forth one hour twice a year would be disastrous. It 
would not only seriously harm people’s bio-rhythms and 
thus cause health problems, but also it would slow down 
work, and the nation would lose money from the 
lowered production. Switching time back and forth 
would be costly for businesses and airlines, and be 
confusing for lots of people. We should remember that 
the nation tried this system about 20 years ago, and that 
it caused so much trouble that we came back to the 
system we have now, which seems to work just fine. 
What’s the point of changing the time system that works 
into the one that is going to be confusing?
