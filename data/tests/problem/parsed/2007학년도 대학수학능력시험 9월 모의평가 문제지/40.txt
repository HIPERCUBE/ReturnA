But it’s never a permanent imprint; the next musician 
to come along can smooth out the clay and mold it in a

Every musician brings his or her own ideas and talents

unique as fingerprints. ( ① ) Classical music is like 
perpetually wet clay. ( ② ) A musician grabs hold of it 
and molds it according to personal tastes and experiences, 
leaving an impress on the music. ( ③ ) Obviously, this

has not researched the composer and the composition 
sufficiently may make decisions about tempos or phrasing 
that are inappropriate, even harmful to the piece. ( ⑤ )

There is always room for new approaches.
