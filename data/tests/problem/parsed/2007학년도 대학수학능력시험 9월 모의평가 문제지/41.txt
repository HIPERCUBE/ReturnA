41. Golf is probably one of the world’s most popular sports. 
Building new golf courses is the fastest kind of land 
development in the world. An average person walks by a 
golf course and says to himself or herself, “What a lovely 
place!” Golf courses have beautiful grass, lots of green 
plants, and pretty ponds. There are birds in the trees and 
flowers around the clubhouse. The area is quiet, and it 
seems peaceful. This picture of a positive environment, 
however, is not real. Golf course developers take over good 
farmland, destroy the natural habitats of wild animals, and 
pollute the water and the air.
