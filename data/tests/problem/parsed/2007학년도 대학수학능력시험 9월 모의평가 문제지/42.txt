42. If you are the sort of parent who frowns when you hear 
the word “messy,” then relax. No one is suggesting that 
you spread mud or baked beans all over the walls of your 
home. Messy play can quite easily be contained in one part 
of a room. With plenty of newspaper, trash bags, and 
aprons, any untidiness can be cleaned up in no time. 
Messy play at home will help your child develop his 
creative skills, as he experiments with different materials 
and textures and learns about colors by mixing paints 
together. And don’t worry too much about clearing up 
afterwards. The benefits of messy play far outweigh the 
disadvantages of a few spots of paint or mud.
