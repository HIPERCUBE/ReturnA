It is all too easy to assume that everything in life is 
going to work out perfectly. Some people plan their 
entire lives for years assuming that things will happen 
exactly as they hope. For example, some college 
students begin planning at the beginning of their 
freshman year what classes they will be taking through 
graduate school and then where they will end up 
working. The problem is, once they fail one class or 
have a bad experience that leads them to doubt their 
major, all of these plans fall apart. In general, we 
should plan the future based on what we expect to 
happen. Unfortunately, things do not always work out 
as we want, so we must be prepared for anything.
