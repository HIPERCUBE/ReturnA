It is all too easy to assume that everything in life is 
going to work out perfectly. Some people plan their 
entire lives for years assuming that things will happen 
exactly as they hope. For example, some college 
students begin planning at the beginning of their 
freshman year what classes they will be taking through 
graduate school and then where they will end up 
working. The problem is, once they fail one class or 
have a bad experience that leads them to doubt their 
major, all of these plans fall apart. In general, we 
should plan the future based on what we expect to 
happen. Unfortunately, things do not always work out 
as we want, so we must be prepared for anything.

(A)
There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his 
sons to learn not to judge things too quickly. So (a) he 
sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a 
pear tree that was a great distance away. 
(B)
The man then explained to his sons that they were all 
right because they had each seen only one season in the 
tree’s life. (b) He said, “You should not judge a tree by 
only one season. The same is true of people’s lives. A 
person’s life can only be measured at the end, when all 
the seasons are up. Therefore, sons, don’t give up when 
it’s winter. If you do, you will miss the promise of 
your spring, the beauty of your summer, and the 
fulfillment of your fall.”
(C)
The first son (c) he sent in the winter, the second in 
the spring, the third in the summer, and the youngest 
son in the fall. When they had all gone and come back, 
(d) he called them together to describe what they had 
seen.
(D)
The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and 
twisted. The second son said it was covered with green 
buds and full of promise. The third son disagreed; (e) he 
said it was filled with blossoms that smelled so sweet 
and looked so beautiful. The last son disagreed with all 
of them; he said it was ripe and bending with fruit, full 
of life and fulfillment.

[49~50] 두 사람의 대립된 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Person A We must switch to “daylight savings.” By 
starting the day one hour earlier in the summer, people 
gain an hour of daylight, which gives them a longer day 
for either work or leisure. Saving energy is another 
advantage of setting the clock forward. With more 
sunlight late in the day, we can cut down on the use of 
electricity to be spent on lighting and air-conditioning, 
for example. Also, this new system helps the economy 
because people would _______________ for leisure 
activities, shopping, and eating out in the evening. Most 
of the world’s economic powers are on this system 
already, so it would be more convenient for international 
trade and communication. Just from these points alone, 
you can see why we should switch to this system. 
Person B We must stick to our current time system 
because the side effects of switching the clock back and 
forth one hour twice a year would be disastrous. It 
would not only seriously harm people’s bio-rhythms and 
thus cause health problems, but also it would slow down 
work, and the nation would lose money from the 
lowered production. Switching time back and forth 
would be costly for businesses and airlines, and be 
confusing for lots of people. We should remember that 
the nation tried this system about 20 years ago, and that 
it caused so much trouble that we came back to the 
system we have now, which seems to work just fine. 
What’s the point of changing the time system that works 
into the one that is going to be confusing?
