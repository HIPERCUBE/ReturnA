Hunting for food has always been part of human life 
worldwide. Since the dawn of human history, people 
living in the rain forests have hunted for bushmeat. For 
thousands of years they have lived in harmony with their 
forest world. Today, however, the commercial bushmeat 
trade worldwide has become so large that many animals 
are literally on the edge of extinction. Indeed, if the 
bushmeat trade of endangered species isn’t stopped 
immediately, some animals will soon be hunted out of 
existence.
