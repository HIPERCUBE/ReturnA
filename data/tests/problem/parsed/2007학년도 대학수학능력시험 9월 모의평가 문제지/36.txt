The Mongol Empire was not a unified state but a vast 
collection of territories held together by military force. 
Because it was controlled by military leaders, the empire 
carried within it the seeds of its own breakdown. Central 
power rested with the khan and his councilors. Although 
they were well organized militarily, the Mongols had no 
developed concept for ruling conquered populations. New 
conquests were not administered, just economically 
exploited. In areas that were under control longer, 
however, there was some growth of administration. Local 
bureaucracies usually followed administrative patterns that 
had been locally developed.
