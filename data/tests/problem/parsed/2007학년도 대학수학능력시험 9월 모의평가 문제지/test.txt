18. 밑줄 친 They가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
They are caused by the wind blowing over the surface 
of the sea. In many areas of the world, the wind blows 
with enough consistency and force to provide them 
continuously. One way to use their energy is to focus 
them into a narrow channel, increasing their power and 
size. They can then be used directly to spin turbines for 
the production of electricity. There are currently no big 
energy plants using them, but there are a few small ones. 
Even a small one produces enough energy to power a 
local community.
① clouds ② waterfalls ③ typhoons
④ bubbles ⑤ waves
19. 다음 글에서 밑줄 친 this phenomenon이 뜻하는 바로 가장
적절한 것은? [1점]
We are reminded daily of this phenomenon. In the corner 
of a traditional Korean home sits a television set tuned to 
a baseball game in which a visiting American team is 
losing. A Canadian family, meanwhile, decorates their 
home with sculptures and paintings imported from 
Pakistan. Teenagers in Singapore and Hong Kong pay for 
American blue jeans while high school students in England 
and France take courses on the making of traditional 
Indonesian costumes. Around the planet the streams of the 
world’s cultures merge together to form new currents of 
human interaction.
① 신구 문화의 조화 ② 전통 문화의 현대화
③ 세계 문화간의 융화 ④ 신세대의 복고주의
⑤ 소비 문화의 변화
20. 다음 글을 쓴 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Hunting for food has always been part of human life 
worldwide. Since the dawn of human history, people 
living in the rain forests have hunted for bushmeat. For 
thousands of years they have lived in harmony with their 
forest world. Today, however, the commercial bushmeat 
trade worldwide has become so large that many animals 
are literally on the edge of extinction. Indeed, if the 
bushmeat trade of endangered species isn’t stopped 
immediately, some animals will soon be hunted out of 
existence.
* bushmeat: 야생동물 고기
① to warn ② to negotiate ③ to advertise
④ to praise ⑤ to apologize
21. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 어법에 맞는 표현을 골라
짝지은 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Our basic nature is to act, and not to be acted upon. Not 
only does this enable us to choose our response to particular 
circumstances, but this encourages us to (A) create / creating 
circumstances. Taking the initiative means recognizing our 
responsibility to make things happen. Over the years, I 
(B) am / have frequently counseled people who wanted 
better jobs to show more initiative. The response is usually 
agreement. Most people can see (C) what / how powerfully 
such an approach would affect their opportunities for 
employment or advancement.
(A) (B)  (C)
① create ---- have ---- what
② create ---- am ---- how
③ create ---- have ---- how
④ creating ---- am ---- what
⑤ creating ---- have ---- what
22. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
We have ① long known about IQ and rational 
intelligence. And, in part ② because of recent advances in 
neuroscience and psychology, we have begun to appreciate 
the importance of emotional intelligence. But we are 
largely ③ ignorant of that there is such a thing ④ as 
visual intelligence. Vision is normally so swif t and sure, so 
dependable and informative, and apparently so effortless 
that we take it for ⑤ granted.
* neuroscience: 신경과학

23. 다음 글에서 전체의 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Your grandmother probably urged you to eat plenty of 
what she called roughage. Now we tend to call it fiber. 
① This important nutrient has tremendous health benefits 
and is found in a variety of foods such as vegetables and 
fruits. ② Fiber is best known for its ability to keep your 
digestive system working smoothly. ③ The benefits of 
fiber do not stop in the internal organs. ④ Some 
physicians emphasize the functions of the body and 
attempt to find new medicines. ⑤ Fiber has been shown 
to reduce the risk of heart disease, at least in part by 
reducing cholesterol levels.
* roughage: 섬유질 식품
[24~27] 다음 글의 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을
고르시오.
24. The nineteenth century saw a change of attitude which 
led to a separation in people’s minds of the scientific and 
the artistic. From this period the roles of mathematicians 
and architects were seen as ________ in a way that did 
not happen in the seventeenth century. This is not to say 
that the connections between mathematics and architecture 
disappeared, just that the scientific and artistic aspects were 
seen as complementary skills not to be found in the same 
person. Of course there were still those who did excel in 
both mathematics and architecture; it was only the 
perceptions that changed.
* complementary: 상호 보완적인
① distinct ② excellent ③ similar
④ trivial ⑤ dependent
25. I scheduled a meeting with a client for 8:00 one 
morning. I called the day before to confirm the date and 
time. When I arrived at the client’s office the morning of 
the meeting, he looked puzzled. “What are you doing here? 
Didn’t you get my message?” he asked. Here’s what 
happened: My client worked late the evening before trying 
to prepare for our meeting. Realizing he wouldn’t be ready, 
he sent me an e-mail at 8:30 p.m., telling me that we 
needed to reschedule. I have a life, and I usually don’t 
read e-mails in the evening. If he had called, I would have 
known not to show up. This is a classic case of someone 
sending an e-mail without thinking of the best way to 
deliver the message to the reader. ________________________
① He should have phoned me.
② I must have read the e-mail.
③ He must have worked overnight.
④ He could have sent an e-mail to me.
⑤ I should have rescheduled the meeting.
26. The word “addiction” is often used loosely in 
conversation. People will refer to themselves as mystery 
book addicts or cookie addicts. E. B. White writes of his 
interest in gardening: “We are hooked and are making an 
attempt to keep the habit.” Yet nobody really believes that 
reading mystery books or ordering seeds by catalog is 
serious enough to be compared with addictions to drugs or 
alcohol. The word “addiction” is here used jokingly to 
represent ___________________________.
① an experience that is hardly exotic
② a search for an alternative to bad habits
③ temporary loneliness and recurrent relief
④ the inability to function normally without drugs
⑤ a strong desire for some pleasurable activities
27. The price of an autograph depends on ________________. 
For example, famous people like Angelina Jolie and Matt 
Damon sign a lot of autographs. Therefore, their autographs 
are common and are not worth much. On the other hand, 
Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow seldom sign anything. This 
makes their autographs more valuable. Similarly, Queen 
Elizabeth Ⅱ almost never signs autographs. Therefore, 
something with her signature on it might sell for around 
$3,500. It doesn’t matter if the person is dead. Elvis 
Presley and Napoleon signed many things. Their signatures 
are only worth $1,500.
① how old it is ② what talent one has
③ how rare it is ④ which job one has
⑤ how famous one is
28. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말을 골라
짝지은 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
The traditionally trained painters, who were previously 
(A) confined / compared mostly to exact copy of natural 
objects, enjoyed an important outlet, impressionist art, at 
the end of the nineteenth century. Especially, many French 
painters produced enormous quantities of impressionistic art, 
inspired by the characteristic images of natural objects. 
These works (B) rejected / reflected the major themes of the 
times such as love and nature, and the new techniques of 
painting intensified and illuminated those themes. Most 
impressionist painters (C) objected / contributed to the new 
movement of fine art. Manet’s output was particularly 
excellent in capturing the changes of sunlight.
(A) (B) (C)
① confined ---- rejected ---- objected
② confined ---- reflected ---- contributed
③ confined ---- rejected ---- contributed
④ compared ---- rejected ---- objected
⑤ compared ---- reflected ---- objected

29. 다음 그림에 관한 설명에서 밑줄 친 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지
않은 것은? [3점]
There are millions of people who require different 
lenses to see near and faraway objects. They use bifocals, 
which are very tiring to wear. Now a practical alternative 
is on the horizon. A group of researchers have created an 
experimental model of a pair of electronic eyeglasses that 
can refocus ① automatically. As illustrated above, they 
are ② equipped with a small battery. With a flip of a 
switch, the battery sends electricity to patterned 
electrodes ③ coated on the lens. Then the molecules in 
the liquid-crystal layer ④ sandwiched between the two 
lenses rotate, altering the way they bend light. In less 
than a second, the lens ⑤ distorts focus. 
* bifocals: (원근 겸용의) 이중 초점 안경
* electrode: 전극
30. 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
The development of dialects mainly results from limited 
communication between different parts of a community that 
share one language. Under such circumstances, changes that 
take place in the language of one part of the community do 
not spread elsewhere. (A) , the speech varieties 
become more distinct from one another. If contact 
continues to be limited for long enough, sufficient changes 
will accumulate to make the speech varieties mutually 
unintelligible, which usually leads to the recognition of 
separate languages. The different changes that took place in 
spoken Latin in different parts of the Roman Empire, 
(B) , eventually gave rise to the modern Romance 
languages, including French, Spanish, and Italian.
(A) (B)
① Otherwise ---- for example
② Otherwise ---- therefore
③ As a result ---- however
④ As a result ---- for example
⑤ That is ---- however
31. 다음 글에 나타난 필자의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
I don’t know politics but I know the names of those 
people in power, and can repeat them like the days of 
the week, or the names of the months, beginning with 
Nehru. I am Indian, very brown, born in Malabar. I 
speak three languages, write in two, and dream in one. 
“Don’t write in English,” they said, “English is not your 
mother tongue.” Why not leave me alone, critics, friends, 
visiting cousins, every one of you? Why not let me 
speak in any language I like? The language I speak 
becomes mine. Though it seems funny, as being half 
English and half Indian, it voices my joys, my longings, 
and my hopes.
① annoyed ② amused ③ indifferent
④ sympathetic ⑤ apologetic
32. 다음 글에서 필자의 주장으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Recently, television-news coverage, assisted by the new 
satellite technology, began to bring “instant news” into 
our living rooms. The immediacy and intimacy of the 
media have somehow allowed the events and persons of  
so-called “fame” to precede those of worthiness. Before 
the introduction of the new technology, thoughtful 
objectivity and measured delivery had been most trusted. 
The emphasis in news began to shift away from analysis 
and toward action. The prize for broadcast journalism 
often seems to be going to the first, as opposed to the 
best, coverage. Now, watching the news, we often find 
ourselves abandoned. It is time to think seriously about 
the true value of news coverage.
① 과도한 TV 시청을 자제해야 한다.
② 뉴스 보도 장비의 현대화가 시급하다.
③ 현장 취재가 사건의 분석보다 중요하다.
④ 뉴스 보도의 진정한 가치 정립이 필요하다.
⑤ 시청자의 알 권리를 위해 신속한 보도가 필요하다.

33. Chocolate, cake, and candies are full of sugar and one 
day it may power your car. Sugar is already the fuel for 
millions of Brazilian drivers. How is this possible? When 
sugar is fermented, it produces alcohol. Alcohol is mixed 
with gasoline, creating a cleaner burning fuel. Investors are 
betting big on alternative fuels derived from sugar and 
other crops. Sugar producing countries such as Brazil and 
Thailand have invested heavily in alcohol projects to 
increase their production of the alternative energy. With oil 
prices high, alternative fuels are becoming a more realistic 
option as well as one that can offer environmental benefits.
① 알코올의 생성 원리 ② 사탕수수 재배법
③ 친환경 대체 연료 개발 ④ 에너지 산업 투자 안내
⑤ 알코올 연료의 장단점
34. When scientists use a device called a calorimeter, the 
piece of food to be measured is placed inside the device, 
sealed, and then burned. The energy from the food heats 
the water surrounding the chamber. By weighing the 
amount of water heated, noting the increase in the water 
temperature, and multiplying the two, the energy capacity 
of the food can be measured. For example, if 10 liters of 
water surrounding the chamber is 20 degrees centigrade 
before combustion and then is measured at 25 degrees after 
combustion, the difference in temperature (5 degrees) is 
multiplied by the volume of water (10 liters) to arrive at 
the caloric value (50 calories of energy).
* combustion: 연소
① the energy capacity of food
② various parts of a calorimeter
③ how to measure food temperature
④ various roles of water in food science
⑤ how to calculate the caloric value of food

Production of Electronic Merchandise
of the Top Five Countries
This chart shows the changes in the total value of 
electronic merchandise produced by the top five countries 
between 2001 and 2004 in terms of US dollars. ① Korea 
showed an increase in the production of electronic 
merchandise in 2004 in comparison with that of 2001. 
② The U.S.A. was the largest producer of electronic 
merchandise both in 2001 and in 2004. ③ Notably, 
among the top five countries, China achieved the largest 
increase in amount in this period. ④ Japan also made an 
increase in electronic products, but the Japanese increase 
was smaller than that of Germany. ⑤ Each of the five 
countries produced more electronic merchandise in 2004 
than in 2001.
36. 몽고 제국에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The Mongol Empire was not a unified state but a vast 
collection of territories held together by military force. 
Because it was controlled by military leaders, the empire 
carried within it the seeds of its own breakdown. Central 
power rested with the khan and his councilors. Although 
they were well organized militarily, the Mongols had no 
developed concept for ruling conquered populations. New 
conquests were not administered, just economically 
exploited. In areas that were under control longer, 
however, there was some growth of administration. Local 
bureaucracies usually followed administrative patterns that 
had been locally developed.
① 군사력으로 광대한 영토를 유지하였다.
② 붕괴의 원인은 내부에 잠재해 있었다.
③ 칸과 참모들에게 권력이 집중되어 있었다.
④ 피정복민을 통치할 법과 제도를 완비하였다.
⑤ 새로운 정복지들을 경제적으로 착취하였다.
37. 청각 장애인을 위한 전화에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는
것은?
A device that enables the totally deaf to communicate 
with each other by telephone has been developed by the 
New York Telephone Co. The “Sensicall,” a plastic box of 
electronic circuits, is wired to a standard telephone. The 
deaf-blind use a vibrating-button model of the Sensicall, 
the seeing-deaf a blinking-light model. A blind person 
placing his fingers on the button can feel the vibrations, 
sense their duration, and interpret the short and long 
sounds as dots and dashes. A seeing-deaf person utilizes a 
blinking-light unit, with the duration of the light blink 
indicating a short or long sound ― a dot or dash.
① 전혀 듣지 못하는 사람들은 사용할 수 없다.
② 전자회로 상자를 일반 전화기에 연결하여 사용한다.
③ 시각 장애가 있는 청각 장애인은 점멸식 장치를 사용한다.
④ 열과 빛을 감지하는 특수 전자 장치가 부착되어 있다.
⑤ 시각 장애가 없는 청각 장애인은 진동식 장치를 사용한다.

I was thrilled when your establishment moved into our 
neighborhood. I appreciate the convenience that your 
family-run business provides. Your store is always clean 
and well-stocked, and your workers are always attentive 
and knowledgeable. But I would like to bring one 
consideration to your attention, and that is the cost of your 
merchandise. I realize that a family-run business will be 
more expensive than a chain store, and I’ve been willing to 
pay that difference. Frequently, however, your prices are 
nearly double what I would have paid at other stores. I 
want to continue shopping at your store, but I’m not sure I 
can consistently afford to pay such high prices.

① 상점의 영업시간이 짧다.
② 상품 진열이 잘 되어 있다.
③ 상점을 이용하기 편리하다.
④ 점원들의 근무 자세가 좋다.
⑤ 상점의 물건 값이 너무 비싸다.
39. 한 연구 보고에 관한 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
For most of the world’s plant life, the effects of 
climate change over the past two decades have been 
productive, according to an analysis of climate and 
satellite data collected between 1982 and 1999. The 
research addresses the question of how global vegetation 
has responded to changes in rainfall, temperature, and 
cloud cover patterns. Such climate factors determine how 
vegetation grows. Previous studies have looked at 
vegetation’s response to climate change at regional scales, 
but this is the first study to look at it from a global 
perspective. According to the analysis, global climate 
change has eased climatic constraints on plant life around 
the globe, allowing vegetation to increase by six percent 
over the study period.
* constraint: 제약, 억제
① 강수량이 식물 생장의 주된 요인이었다.
② 기후 변화가 식물 생장에 도움을 주었다.
③ 기후 요인에 의해 식물 생장이 억제되었다.

⑤ 지역적 관점에서 식물 생장의 요인이 규명되었다.

곳은?
But it’s never a permanent imprint; the next musician 
to come along can smooth out the clay and mold it in a 
completely different way.
Every musician brings his or her own ideas and talents 
to a composition, so the results can be as varied and 
unique as fingerprints. ( ① ) Classical music is like 
perpetually wet clay. ( ② ) A musician grabs hold of it 
and molds it according to personal tastes and experiences, 
leaving an impress on the music. ( ③ ) Obviously, this 
sort of freedom can be abused. ( ④ ) A musician who 
has not researched the composer and the composition 
sufficiently may make decisions about tempos or phrasing 
that are inappropriate, even harmful to the piece. ( ⑤ ) 
There are, however, relatively few absolutes in music. 
There is always room for new approaches.

41. Golf is probably one of the world’s most popular sports. 
Building new golf courses is the fastest kind of land 
development in the world. An average person walks by a 
golf course and says to himself or herself, “What a lovely 
place!” Golf courses have beautiful grass, lots of green 
plants, and pretty ponds. There are birds in the trees and 
flowers around the clubhouse. The area is quiet, and it 
seems peaceful. This picture of a positive environment, 
however, is not real. Golf course developers take over good 
farmland, destroy the natural habitats of wild animals, and 
pollute the water and the air.
① Golf: An Environment-Friendly Sport
② Golf: The Fastest Growing Industry
③ Golf Courses: A Home for Wildlife
④ Golf Courses: Reality Behind Appearance
⑤ Beautiful Landscape Around the Clubhouse
42. If you are the sort of parent who frowns when you hear 
the word “messy,” then relax. No one is suggesting that 
you spread mud or baked beans all over the walls of your 
home. Messy play can quite easily be contained in one part 
of a room. With plenty of newspaper, trash bags, and 
aprons, any untidiness can be cleaned up in no time. 
Messy play at home will help your child develop his 
creative skills, as he experiments with different materials 
and textures and learns about colors by mixing paints 
together. And don’t worry too much about clearing up 
afterwards. The benefits of messy play far outweigh the 
disadvantages of a few spots of paint or mud.

④ Parenting: A Way of Self-Discipline

This would be a day both father and son could treasure 
all their lives ― the boy’s first day at Fenway Park and 
the day they’d both looked forward to for so long. They 
took a chance at the reserved-seat ticket window and 
were rewarded with a pair of lower box seats. The boy 
sat in the second row just a few feet away from the 
field. And the father watched him and felt his heart 
bursting with joy. They did all the things they had 
planned: hotdogs, ice cream sandwiches, reading the 
scoreboard, watching the crowd, chasing foul balls, and 
cheering. This is what life is all about, the father thought. 
A boy and his dad and baseball. Nothing beats it!
① warm and delightful ② monotonous and idle
③ mysterious and scary ④ skeptical and cynical
⑤ solemn and grave

[3점]
A finance professor once told me that the best way to 
predict the future is to study the past. For a while I 
thought that was only applicable in finance.
(A) The step toward the positive direction is to identify 
your barriers, come to terms with them, and decide 
to move on. What works for most job seekers is to 
look through their past experiences to help them 
build for the future.
(B) In reality, this is true in more than finance. When 
we seek employment, the “negativity” of the 
experience is of ten more magnified than the positive. 
We tend to gravitate toward what is not happening 
rather than what is.
(C) At some point during your job search you will 
question the source of all this negativity. The fear of 
the unknown and what the next step will be is what 
is happening. So how might you turn all this around 
and move in a positive direction?

It is all too easy to assume that everything in life is 
going to work out perfectly. Some people plan their 
entire lives for years assuming that things will happen 
exactly as they hope. For example, some college 
students begin planning at the beginning of their 
freshman year what classes they will be taking through 
graduate school and then where they will end up 
working. The problem is, once they fail one class or 
have a bad experience that leads them to doubt their 
major, all of these plans fall apart. In general, we 
should plan the future based on what we expect to 
happen. Unfortunately, things do not always work out 
as we want, so we must be prepared for anything.

There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his 
sons to learn not to judge things too quickly. So (a) he 
sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a 
pear tree that was a great distance away. 
(B)
The man then explained to his sons that they were all 
right because they had each seen only one season in the 
tree’s life. (b) He said, “You should not judge a tree by 
only one season. The same is true of people’s lives. A 
person’s life can only be measured at the end, when all 
the seasons are up. Therefore, sons, don’t give up when 
it’s winter. If you do, you will miss the promise of 
your spring, the beauty of your summer, and the 
fulfillment of your fall.”
(C)
The first son (c) he sent in the winter, the second in 
the spring, the third in the summer, and the youngest 
son in the fall. When they had all gone and come back, 
(d) he called them together to describe what they had 
seen.
(D)
The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and 
twisted. The second son said it was covered with green 
buds and full of promise. The third son disagreed; (e) he 
said it was filled with blossoms that smelled so sweet 
and looked so beautiful. The last son disagreed with all 
of them; he said it was ripe and bending with fruit, full 
of life and fulfillment.

[49~50] 두 사람의 대립된 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Person A We must switch to “daylight savings.” By 
starting the day one hour earlier in the summer, people 
gain an hour of daylight, which gives them a longer day 
for either work or leisure. Saving energy is another 
advantage of setting the clock forward. With more 
sunlight late in the day, we can cut down on the use of 
electricity to be spent on lighting and air-conditioning, 
for example. Also, this new system helps the economy 
because people would _______________ for leisure 
activities, shopping, and eating out in the evening. Most 
of the world’s economic powers are on this system 
already, so it would be more convenient for international 
trade and communication. Just from these points alone, 
you can see why we should switch to this system. 
Person B We must stick to our current time system 
because the side effects of switching the clock back and 
forth one hour twice a year would be disastrous. It 
would not only seriously harm people’s bio-rhythms and 
thus cause health problems, but also it would slow down 
work, and the nation would lose money from the 
lowered production. Switching time back and forth 
would be costly for businesses and airlines, and be 
confusing for lots of people. We should remember that 
the nation tried this system about 20 years ago, and that 
it caused so much trouble that we came back to the 
system we have now, which seems to work just fine. 
What’s the point of changing the time system that works 
into the one that is going to be confusing?
