There are millions of people who require different 
lenses to see near and faraway objects. They use bifocals, 
which are very tiring to wear. Now a practical alternative 
is on the horizon. A group of researchers have created an 
experimental model of a pair of electronic eyeglasses that 
can refocus ① automatically. As illustrated above, they 
are ② equipped with a small battery. With a flip of a 
switch, the battery sends electricity to patterned 
electrodes ③ coated on the lens. Then the molecules in 
the liquid-crystal layer ④ sandwiched between the two 
lenses rotate, altering the way they bend light. In less 
than a second, the lens ⑤ distorts focus.
