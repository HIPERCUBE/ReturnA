24. The nineteenth century saw a change of attitude which 
led to a separation in people’s minds of the scientific and 
the artistic. From this period the roles of mathematicians 
and architects were seen as ________ in a way that did 
not happen in the seventeenth century. This is not to say 
that the connections between mathematics and architecture 
disappeared, just that the scientific and artistic aspects were 
seen as complementary skills not to be found in the same 
person. Of course there were still those who did excel in 
both mathematics and architecture; it was only the 
perceptions that changed.
