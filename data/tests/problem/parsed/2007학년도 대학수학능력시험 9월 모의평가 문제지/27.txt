27. The price of an autograph depends on ________________. 
For example, famous people like Angelina Jolie and Matt 
Damon sign a lot of autographs. Therefore, their autographs 
are common and are not worth much. On the other hand, 
Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow seldom sign anything. This 
makes their autographs more valuable. Similarly, Queen 
Elizabeth Ⅱ almost never signs autographs. Therefore, 
something with her signature on it might sell for around 
$3,500. It doesn’t matter if the person is dead. Elvis 
Presley and Napoleon signed many things. Their signatures 
are only worth $1,500.
