We are reminded daily of this phenomenon. In the corner 
of a traditional Korean home sits a television set tuned to 
a baseball game in which a visiting American team is 
losing. A Canadian family, meanwhile, decorates their 
home with sculptures and paintings imported from 
Pakistan. Teenagers in Singapore and Hong Kong pay for 
American blue jeans while high school students in England 
and France take courses on the making of traditional 
Indonesian costumes. Around the planet the streams of the 
world’s cultures merge together to form new currents of 
human interaction.
