42. The convention of communication between scientists is
formal and complicated. If new discoveries are to be taken
seriously by other scientists, certain rigid criteria must be
met. This means, before the new finding can be published and
accepted, the experiment must be repeated and verified
according to accepted procedures. Then, the finding is almost
always communicated through a formal scientific paper or a
journal article. The most important new findings may appear in
a journal of general interests to all scientists, such as Science
or Nature. In either case, the article will not be published until
it has undergone the examination of the journal’s editor and of
two or three anonymous volunteer referees. This is one of the
extensive safeguards of formal science. [3점]
