Our company will be happy to pay for college courses that
enhance your job performance. Before you register for the
course, you must get approval first from your immediate
supervisor and then from Human Resources. After you have
completed the course, you must write a report explaining the
content of the course and its relevance to your position. Then,
you must fill out a payment request. Attach a tuition receipt,
your report, and a copy of your grades to this request and
promptly submit this request to your supervisor. Once your
supervisor has approved the request, you should receive your
check within two weeks.
