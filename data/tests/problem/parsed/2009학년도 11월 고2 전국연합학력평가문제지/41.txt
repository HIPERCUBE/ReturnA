41. Visual Regression means you continually go back to read
words or phrases that have already been completed. It might
sound like this: The... The dog... The dog ate... The dog ate a
bone. Unfortunately, this is done at the expense of your reading
speed. This can quickly be overcome by using hand motions
during reading. Using hand motions can quickly increase your
reading speed by making your eyes view text more visually, as
well as it helps overcome several habits that can slow down
reading speed. Take a simple step to begin increasing your
reading speed with your fingers placed at the start of a line, and
quickly move them toward the right margin.
