[49 ~ 50] 다음 글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
You have been renting your apartment for one year, and your
landlady tells you that (a) she is going to raise the rent $500 a
month. One day, you run into another building tenant, Tina, in
the hall. You tell (b) her of your problem with the landlady.
Tina gives you some advice. Later that week, you run into
another tenant, Frank, who has heard about your situation from
Tina. Frank says to you, “Listen, I know this is none of my
business, but if I were you, I wouldn’t take Tina’s advice about
housing issues. (c) She was forced to leave her last apartment.”
Indeed, since Tina was evicted from (d) her last apartment, it
would appear as if what Frank says makes a lot of sense. But it
does not. That is because Frank is not attacking Tina’s advice;
instead, he is simply attacking her advice with emotion. In fact,
because (e) she has dealt with a fairly serious housing issue,
she might be considered a housing expert. Whether you like
her or not is a separate matter from whether she has good
advice or not. The credibility of advice should be based on
freedom from your biases.
