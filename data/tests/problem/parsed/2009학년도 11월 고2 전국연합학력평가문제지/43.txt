Before the vacuum cleaner became popular, small carpets
were often cleaned by hanging them on a line and using a
carpet beater. This technique relied on the fact that
vibration caused by beating the carpet removed most of the
dirt and dust.
(A) This chamber also contains an ultrasonic transmitter and a
suitable solvent. This is not water but a liquid similar to
the cleaning fluid used at the dry cleaner’s. The ultrasonic
transmitter produces vibrations in the liquid.
(B) These vibrations are passed on to the article being
cleaned. When the article begins to vibrate, dirt and other
unwanted materials are shaken off. Thus, the ultrasonic
transmitter acts just like the carpet beater.
(C) The same principle is used today in ultrasonic cleaning.
The article to be cleaned is placed in a cleaning vessel
called an ultrasonic chamber.
