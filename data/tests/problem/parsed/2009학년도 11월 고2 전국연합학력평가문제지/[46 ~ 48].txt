(A) Rosalyn Bettiford, a forty-year-old editor, arrived at
her weekend house in Washington, Connecticut―a two-hour
drive from Manhattan. The July had turned chilly. Her teenage
son was asleep in his bedroom. The living room was dark. As
her eyes adjusted, she noticed that one of the big
sliding-glass windows was wide open.
(B) She reached for its handle and―as the heavy window
suddenly slipped out of its track―she plunged, screaming,
to a terrace twelve feet below. In that fall, Rosalyn broke
her arms and smashed all her toes. As soon as her
terrified son found her moaning, he immediately called to
the local firehouse for help.
(C) They worked for the neighbor who was in difficulties
without being forced to do it. These kind of people are all
over the world. They provide relief after typhoon or
flooding, or help build homes for the homeless people,
delivering valuable services without payment for their
time, skills and risks. It is said that their activities are
part of the hidden half-the largely off-the-books part-of
each country’s common wealth system.
(D) The young men who arrived only minutes later quickly
splinted her arm and drove her madly over country roads
to the nearest hospital. They saved her life and vanished
quietly into the night when doctors came to her side. The
next day they turned up at her bedside in the hospital to
see how she was doing. They were at the
local firehouse.
