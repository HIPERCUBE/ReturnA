This is a product traditionally made of chicle, a natural latex,
but for reasons of economy and quality this may be made from
artificial rubber instead of chicle. Common flavors of this
include mint, cinnamon, and other fruity flavors, all of which
are available sugar­free. The regular varieties of this can be
sweetened with either cane sugar or corn syrup. Users of this
sometimes make unpleasant noises, which are often quite loud
in silent places. Many schools do not allow their students to
chew this because students often stick this to desks, chairs,
floors, or similar flat surfaces.
