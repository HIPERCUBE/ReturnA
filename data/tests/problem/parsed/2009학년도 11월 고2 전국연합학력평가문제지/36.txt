36. Tahina palm에 관한 다음 글의 내용과일치하는것은?
A gigantic new species of palm, Tahina palm, is found only in
a small area of northwestern Madagascar. With fewer than
one hundred individuals, it is one of the world’s rarest palm
species. The plant is notable in that it flowers itself to death,
producing a spectacular last blooming with countless flowers.
Tahina palm is unrelated to any other of the 170 palms of
Madagascar and is most closely related to 3 species: one each
in the Arabian peninsula, Thailand, and China. Soon after the
publication of the species, seeds were distributed throughout
the palm grower community for its conservation. Tahina palm
has become a highly prized ornament plant, and it will continue
to be grown by plant growers.
