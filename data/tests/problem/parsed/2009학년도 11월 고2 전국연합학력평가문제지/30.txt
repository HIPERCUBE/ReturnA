30. 그림에 대한 글의 내용 중, 밑줄 친 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은
것은?
sunlight
mirror
a piece of balloon
Everyone is accustomed to hearing sounds, but here is a
chance to see sound waves. Remove both ends from a tin can.
Next, cut and stretch a piece of a balloon to fit over one end of
the can. Hold it in place with a rubber band ① around the
balloon and the can several times. Using a drop of glue, fasten a
small piece of mirror, about 1/2 inch ② square to the balloon.
Stand so that the sunlight from a window ③misses the mirror,
moving the can around until the reflection shows up on a wall.
Making different sounds, shout directly into the ④ open end of
the can. As the rubber on the can vibrates, so does the mirror.
That’s what makes the reflection on the wall⑤move.
