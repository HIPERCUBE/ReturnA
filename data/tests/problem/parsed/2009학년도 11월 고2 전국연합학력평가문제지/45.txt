들어갈 말을 바르게 짝지은 것은?
Neither the teacher nor students should worry much about
grammatical mistakes in language class. If a student asks
the question ‘You want collect our books?’ he should be
corrected by the teacher. But first and more important, he
should also be praised―‘Good, Well done. Yes, I want to
collect your books. You ask the question again so everyone
can hear it―Listen. “Do you want to collect our books?”
Now you ask. Good.’ In this way, the form of the question
has been corrected but the student has been given full
credit for making himself understood. This method will
increase your students’ motivation, and he will now be
eager to try again and not be nervous to make mistakes.
Students’ grammatical mistakes should be corrected in a
way students are praised at first and (A) to try again,
so that they can build confidence and lower (B) about
making mistakes.
(A) (B)
① encouraged …… anxiety
② forbidden …… expectation
③ forced …… possibility
④ forbidden …… anxiety
⑤ encouraged …… possibility

(A) Rosalyn Bettiford, a forty-year-old editor, arrived at
her weekend house in Washington, Connecticut―a two-hour
drive from Manhattan. The July had turned chilly. Her teenage
son was asleep in his bedroom. The living room was dark. As
her eyes adjusted, she noticed that one of the big
sliding-glass windows was wide open.
(B) She reached for its handle and―as the heavy window
suddenly slipped out of its track―she plunged, screaming,
to a terrace twelve feet below. In that fall, Rosalyn broke
her arms and smashed all her toes. As soon as her
terrified son found her moaning, he immediately called to
the local firehouse for help.
(C) They worked for the neighbor who was in difficulties
without being forced to do it. These kind of people are all
over the world. They provide relief after typhoon or
flooding, or help build homes for the homeless people,
delivering valuable services without payment for their
time, skills and risks. It is said that their activities are
part of the hidden half-the largely off-the-books part-of
each country’s common wealth system.
(D) The young men who arrived only minutes later quickly
splinted her arm and drove her madly over country roads
to the nearest hospital. They saved her life and vanished
quietly into the night when doctors came to her side. The
next day they turned up at her bedside in the hospital to
see how she was doing. They were at the
local firehouse.

[49 ~ 50] 다음 글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
You have been renting your apartment for one year, and your
landlady tells you that (a) she is going to raise the rent $500 a
month. One day, you run into another building tenant, Tina, in
the hall. You tell (b) her of your problem with the landlady.
Tina gives you some advice. Later that week, you run into
another tenant, Frank, who has heard about your situation from
Tina. Frank says to you, “Listen, I know this is none of my
business, but if I were you, I wouldn’t take Tina’s advice about
housing issues. (c) She was forced to leave her last apartment.”
Indeed, since Tina was evicted from (d) her last apartment, it
would appear as if what Frank says makes a lot of sense. But it
does not. That is because Frank is not attacking Tina’s advice;
instead, he is simply attacking her advice with emotion. In fact,
because (e) she has dealt with a fairly serious housing issue,
she might be considered a housing expert. Whether you like
her or not is a separate matter from whether she has good
advice or not. The credibility of advice should be based on
freedom from your biases.
