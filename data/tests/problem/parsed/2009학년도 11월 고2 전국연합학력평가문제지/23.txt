23. What does it mean to say that an informative speech is too
technical? It may mean the subject matter is too
for the audience. Any subject can be popularized―but only up
to a point. Say your subject is electronic amplifiers. The
important thing for a speaker to know is what can be easily
explained to an ordinary audience and what cannot. For
example, it’s relatively easy to explain in words how to
operate an amplifier. But to give a full scientific account of
how an amplifier works cannot be done in any reasonable time
unless the audience knows the principles of audio technology.
The material is just too technical to be understood by a
general audience.
