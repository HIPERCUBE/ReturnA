18. 밑줄친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장적절한것은? [1점]
This is a product traditionally made of chicle, a natural latex,
but for reasons of economy and quality this may be made from
artificial rubber instead of chicle. Common flavors of this
include mint, cinnamon, and other fruity flavors, all of which
are available sugar­free. The regular varieties of this can be
sweetened with either cane sugar or corn syrup. Users of this
sometimes make unpleasant noises, which are often quite loud
in silent places. Many schools do not allow their students to
chew this because students often stick this to desks, chairs,
floors, or similar flat surfaces.
① gum ② jelly ③ candy ④ cookie ⑤ chocolate
19. 밑줄친 They[them]이 가리키는대상이나머지넷과다른것은?
Rain dances were ceremonial dances performed by native
Americans during dry summer days and times of drought.
①They were used to invoke rain and to protect the harvest.
②They varied within different tribes but were performed in
all cases by both men and women. Specifically, some tribes
practiced ③ them to cleanse evil spirits from the earth. Rain
dances were primarily performed by both men and women in
zigzag patterns. The Pacific Northwest tribes used drums
when performing ④ them providing a symbol of unity. While
dancing, the tribes beat ⑤ them which were decorated with
various animal paintings and images representative of natural
forces.
20. 다음글의밑줄친부분중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
E-commerce is to the information revolution ①what the
railroad was to the industrial revolution. While the railroad
mastered distance, e-commerce eliminates it. The Internet
provides enterprises with the ability to link one activity to
another and to make real­time data widely ② available. It
strengthens the move ③ to break up the big corporation of
today. But, the greatest strength of e-commerce is that it
provides the consumer with a whole range of products,
④whoever makes them. E-commerce separates, for the first
time, selling and producing. Selling is tied no longer to
production but to distribution. There is absolutely no reason
why any e-commerce enterprise should limit ⑤ themselves to
marketing and selling one maker’s products.
21. (A), (B), (C)에서 어법에 맞는 표현을 바르게 짝지은 것은?
The university catalog can be used to (A) help / helping the
freshman who is confused by university life. It is revised
every year in order that it will be up-to-date. First of all,
there is in this catalog a list of all the courses which are
offered by the university. These courses are arranged (B)
alphabetical / alphabetically by each department in order that
the student may choose which courses he wants to take. It is
also from this list of courses of each department (C) while / that
a degree plan for the student can be devised, which will be
within the limits of the regulations of the university.
(A) (B) (C)
① help …… alphabetically …… while
② help …… alphabetical …… that
③ helping …… alphabetically …… that
④ help …… alphabetically …… that
⑤ helping …… alphabetical …… while
22. 다음글에서전체흐름과관계 없는 문장은?
When you know you have offended someone, you must take
corrective actions.①Choose an appropriate method, such as a
letter, an e-mail, a voice mail, a phone call, or speaking face
to face. ② If possible, apologize right away for little things like
bumping into someone. ③ In more serious cases, show your
regret with a statement such as “I am sorry. I felt bad the
minute I told you like that. I shouldn’t have done that.” ④ If
you recognize that your actions are praiseworthy, humbly
accept complimentary remarks. ⑤To be complete, an apology
should attempt to remedy the injury, whether it is someone’s
property or emotion that was hurt.

23. What does it mean to say that an informative speech is too
technical? It may mean the subject matter is too
for the audience. Any subject can be popularized―but only up
to a point. Say your subject is electronic amplifiers. The
important thing for a speaker to know is what can be easily
explained to an ordinary audience and what cannot. For
example, it’s relatively easy to explain in words how to
operate an amplifier. But to give a full scientific account of
how an amplifier works cannot be done in any reasonable time
unless the audience knows the principles of audio technology.
The material is just too technical to be understood by a
general audience.
① informal ② subjective
③ specialized ④ reasonable
⑤ instructive
24. In choosing one thing over another, we make a trade-off.
We give up one thing in order to have another. You and a
friend decide to go to a ball game. That decision has a cost
that goes beyond the price of your tickets. In going to the
game, you are also giving up the next best alternative. It is
what you would have done if you had not gone to the game.
For example, you might have spent the afternoon practicing
your jump shot. The of watching
the game was missing the practice. In short, whenever you
choose one thing over another, you give up the next best
option.
① financial profit ② risk management
③ opportunity cost ④ on-the-job training
⑤ price competitiveness
25. Industrial society set a clear border between life at home
and life on the job. Today, however, for the growing millions
who work from home, the line is unclear. Robert Reich, a labor
expert, points out that a significant part of the labor force
consists of independent contractors, free agents and others
who work in company A but are actually employees of
company B. “In a few years,” says Reich, “a company may be
best defined by who has access to what data and who gets
what portion of revenues over what period of time. There may
be no ‘employees’ at all, strictly speaking.” It is certain that
revolutions in labor environment .
① cause conflicts ② smash boundaries
③ guarantee prosperity ④ restore relationships
⑤ make people frustrated
26. A person trying to interpret a situation often looks at those
around him to see how he should react. If everyone else is
calm and indifferent, he will tend to remain so; if everyone
else is reacting strongly, he is likely to become stimulated.
However, occasionally the reactions of others can provide
. For example, the studied nonchalance
of patients in a dentist’s waiting room doesn’t show their inner
anxiety well. It is considered embarrassing to “lose your cool”
in public. In a potentially severe situation, then, everyone will
appear less concerned than he is in fact. A crowd can thus
force inaction on its members by implying that an event is not
an emergency. Any individual in such a crowd fears that he may
appear a fool if he behaves as though it were serious. [3점]
* nonchalance: 무관심, 태연
① useful guidance ② false information
③ obvious implication ④ stable reinforcement
⑤ emotional impression
27. In a study, fitness tests were done to 46 inactive women
divided into two groups. Regardless of how they had actually
performed on the fitness test, members of one group were told
they had scored in the highest of five levels of fitness, while
the others were told their performance was poor. All the
women were then asked to work out on stationary bikes.
Those who had been told they had scored well on the fitness
exam reported less fatigue than the women who believed they
had done poorly on the fitness test. Although the study was
small, its lesson is important: If you believe in your fitness
potential, you are likely to .
① become inactive as time passes
② live up to your own expectations
③ feel more depressed than before
④ need more sleep to work out well
⑤ become a good leader in your group
28. (A), (B), (C)에서 적절한 어휘를 바르게 짝지은 것은?
We are normally unaware of the continuous rhythmic sounds
in our chests. But we can hear our heart beat at quiet
moments like just before sleep. The sudden awareness of
these sounds can be (A) relaxing / distressing , because it is
almost always associated with moments of fear and anxiety.
Long before the present day, interestingly, the ancients
believed that passion and all emotion resided in the chest. But
in the first century A.D., Galen took the romance out of the
heart myth and (B) declared / denied , on an anatomical basis,
that the heart was simply a natural pump to cultivate the
nourishment of the blood to nerves and muscles. Yet, despite
these 2,000 years of knowing of its (C) mechanical / emotional
function, people daily experience the heart as an organ of
emotion. * anatomical: 해부학적인
(A) (B) (C)
① relaxing …… denied …… emotional
② relaxing …… declared …… mechanical
③ distressing …… declared …… emotional
④ distressing …… declared …… mechanical
⑤ distressing …… denied …… emotional
29. 다음글의분위기로가장적절한것은?
There is a road eight miles from the city up which I have
walked sometimes on my way to golf. I think it is called
Acacia Road; some pretty name like that. It may rain in Acacia
Road, but never when I am there. The sun shines on Leo
Lodge with its pink may tree, on the Cedars with its two clean
limes, it casts its shadow on the ivy of Holly House, and upon
the whole road there is a pleasant afternoon peace. I cannot
walk along Acacia Road without feeling that life could be very
happy in it―when the sun is shining. It must be jolly to live in
Leo Lodge with its pink may tree. Sometimes I fancy that a
suburban home is the true home after all.
① tense and urgent ② funny and humorous
③ pastoral and peaceful ④ scary and frightening
⑤ festive and exciting
30. 그림에 대한 글의 내용 중, 밑줄 친 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은
것은?
sunlight
mirror
a piece of balloon
Everyone is accustomed to hearing sounds, but here is a
chance to see sound waves. Remove both ends from a tin can.
Next, cut and stretch a piece of a balloon to fit over one end of
the can. Hold it in place with a rubber band ① around the
balloon and the can several times. Using a drop of glue, fasten a
small piece of mirror, about 1/2 inch ② square to the balloon.
Stand so that the sunlight from a window ③misses the mirror,
moving the can around until the reflection shows up on a wall.
Making different sounds, shout directly into the ④ open end of
the can. As the rubber on the can vibrates, so does the mirror.
That’s what makes the reflection on the wall⑤move.
31. 다음글의 (A), (B)에들어갈말을바르게짝지은것은?
We often think of persuasion as something that a speaker
does to an audience. In fact, persuasion is something that a
speaker does with an audience. Listeners do not just listen
passively, nor do they soak in everything the speaker says.
(A) , while they listen, they assess the speaker’s
credibility, delivery, supporting materials, language, reasoning,
and emotional appeals. This mental give-and-take is
especially vigorous when listeners are highly involved with the
topic and believe it has a direct effect on their lives.
(B) , you must think of your persuasive speech as
a kind of mental dialogue with your audience.
(A) (B)
① Instead …… Therefore
② Furthermore …… Otherwise
③ For instance …… Besides
④ Instead …… However
⑤ Furthermore …… Consequently


37. tarsier에 관한 다음 글의 내용과일치하지 않는 것은?
The tarsier is a very peculiar small animal, no larger than an
adult man’s hand. It has enormous eyes; each eyeball is as
large as its entire brain. All tarsier species are nocturnal in
their habits, but some individuals may show more or less
activity during the daytime. Their primary food is insects, and
they catch insects by jumping at them. But they are also
known to prey on small animals, such as birds, snakes, lizards,
and bats. Although the practice of catching and selling them as
stuffed tarsiers to tourists has been stopped, the species is
still threatened by the destruction of its natural forest habitat.
If no action is taken, tarsiers will soon be added to the list of
extinct species.
①성인남자의손과크기가비슷하다.
②자신의뇌크기만한안구를갖고있다.
③야행성이나낮에활동하는개체도있다.
④작은동물들의주요먹이감이다.
⑤대책을세우지않으면멸종될것이다.
[38 ~ 39] 다음글의요지로가장적절한것을고르시오.
38. It seems that the thing more difficult than telling a good joke
is teaching someone how to tell a good joke. But if someone is
telling me a funny story that actually happened, it makes me
laugh a lot more than something that is a made-up joke which
never happened. Therein lies my theory of good joke telling:
Great joke tellers make their own jokes by using what
happened around them and somehow incorporating it into their
jokes. This can be achieved by telling your joke that actually
happened to a friend, a family member, or even yourself.
①친한사람일수록지나친농담을하면안된다.
②농담을진담처럼해야듣는사람을웃길수있다.
③재미있는농담은주변사람으로부터우연히얻게된다.
④실제있었던일을소재로농담을할때효과적이다.
⑤대인관계를위해늘재미있는농담을개발해야한다.
39. Most of us want this or that. We keep thinking about all that
we do not have, and we remain dissatisfied. Each time you
notice yourself falling into the “I wish life were different” trap,
take a step back and reconsider your life. Rather than
complaining about your salary, be grateful that you have a job.
Instead of wishing you were able to take a vacation to Hawaii,
think of ways you can enjoy yourself around home. Focus not
on what you want but on what you have. If you do, your life
will start appearing much better than before. For perhaps the
first time in your life, you will know what it means to feel
satisfied.
①지금의적은자본은행복한내일을위한소중한씨앗이다.
②행복을위해서는현재가진것에초점을두어야한다.
③마음의안정을위해서는사색의시간이필수적이다.
④자신의발전을위해서는다양한경험을해야한다.
⑤성공을위해서는치밀하게인생을설계해야한다.
40. 글의흐름으로보아, 주어진문장이들어가기에가장적절한곳은?
But points can be scored only in a limited number of right
ways, and the game is governed by an elaborate set of
rules.
Competition implies a set of rules that govern the conduct of
the opposed parties. ( ① ) It is one form of interaction that
occurs on all levels―the mutually opposed effort of two or
more persons to attain the same particular goal. ( ② ) In all
instances, however, cheating and physical force are not
permitted. ( ③ ) For example, when two competing college
football teams play against one another, each is striving to
attain the same goal―to score more points than the other
team. ( ④ ) Moreover, using professional players and
unnecessary roughness are both unacceptable forms of
behavior. ( ⑤ ) “Unrestricted competition” is therefore
impossible, because, by definition, all competition is restricted.

41. Visual Regression means you continually go back to read
words or phrases that have already been completed. It might
sound like this: The... The dog... The dog ate... The dog ate a
bone. Unfortunately, this is done at the expense of your reading
speed. This can quickly be overcome by using hand motions
during reading. Using hand motions can quickly increase your
reading speed by making your eyes view text more visually, as
well as it helps overcome several habits that can slow down
reading speed. Take a simple step to begin increasing your
reading speed with your fingers placed at the start of a line, and
quickly move them toward the right margin.
① Causes of Reading the Same Sentence
② Functions of the Brain While Speed Reading
③ Using Fingers: A Way of Overcoming Visual Regression
④ Visual Regression: A Secret to Improving Reading Speed
⑤ Advantages and Disadvantages of Visual Images in Reading
42. The convention of communication between scientists is
formal and complicated. If new discoveries are to be taken
seriously by other scientists, certain rigid criteria must be
met. This means, before the new finding can be published and
accepted, the experiment must be repeated and verified
according to accepted procedures. Then, the finding is almost
always communicated through a formal scientific paper or a
journal article. The most important new findings may appear in
a journal of general interests to all scientists, such as Science
or Nature. In either case, the article will not be published until
it has undergone the examination of the journal’s editor and of
two or three anonymous volunteer referees. This is one of the
extensive safeguards of formal science. [3점]
① Scientists Debating New Findings
② Verification Process of Formal Science
③ Scientific Knowledge for Human beings
④ Introduction to Popular Scientific Journals
⑤ Considerations to Select Scientific Journals
43. 주어진글다음에이어질글의순서로가장적절한것은?
Before the vacuum cleaner became popular, small carpets
were often cleaned by hanging them on a line and using a
carpet beater. This technique relied on the fact that
vibration caused by beating the carpet removed most of the
dirt and dust.
(A) This chamber also contains an ultrasonic transmitter and a
suitable solvent. This is not water but a liquid similar to
the cleaning fluid used at the dry cleaner’s. The ultrasonic
transmitter produces vibrations in the liquid.
(B) These vibrations are passed on to the article being
cleaned. When the article begins to vibrate, dirt and other
unwanted materials are shaken off. Thus, the ultrasonic
transmitter acts just like the carpet beater.
(C) The same principle is used today in ultrasonic cleaning.
The article to be cleaned is placed in a cleaning vessel
called an ultrasonic chamber.

들어갈 말을 바르게 짝지은 것은?
Neither the teacher nor students should worry much about
grammatical mistakes in language class. If a student asks
the question ‘You want collect our books?’ he should be
corrected by the teacher. But first and more important, he
should also be praised―‘Good, Well done. Yes, I want to
collect your books. You ask the question again so everyone
can hear it―Listen. “Do you want to collect our books?”
Now you ask. Good.’ In this way, the form of the question
has been corrected but the student has been given full
credit for making himself understood. This method will
increase your students’ motivation, and he will now be
eager to try again and not be nervous to make mistakes.
Students’ grammatical mistakes should be corrected in a
way students are praised at first and (A) to try again,
so that they can build confidence and lower (B) about
making mistakes.

[46 ~ 48] 다음 글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
(A) Rosalyn Bettiford, a forty-year-old editor, arrived at
her weekend house in Washington, Connecticut―a two-hour
drive from Manhattan. The July had turned chilly. Her teenage
son was asleep in his bedroom. The living room was dark. As
her eyes adjusted, she noticed that one of the big
sliding-glass windows was wide open.
(B) She reached for its handle and―as the heavy window
suddenly slipped out of its track―she plunged, screaming,
to a terrace twelve feet below. In that fall, Rosalyn broke
her arms and smashed all her toes. As soon as her
terrified son found her moaning, he immediately called to
the local firehouse for help.
(C) They worked for the neighbor who was in difficulties
without being forced to do it. These kind of people are all
over the world. They provide relief after typhoon or
flooding, or help build homes for the homeless people,
delivering valuable services without payment for their
time, skills and risks. It is said that their activities are
part of the hidden half-the largely off-the-books part-of
each country’s common wealth system.
(D) The young men who arrived only minutes later quickly
splinted her arm and drove her madly over country roads
to the nearest hospital. They saved her life and vanished
quietly into the night when doctors came to her side. The
next day they turned up at her bedside in the hospital to
see how she was doing. They were at the
local firehouse.

[49 ~ 50] 다음 글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
You have been renting your apartment for one year, and your
landlady tells you that (a) she is going to raise the rent $500 a
month. One day, you run into another building tenant, Tina, in
the hall. You tell (b) her of your problem with the landlady.
Tina gives you some advice. Later that week, you run into
another tenant, Frank, who has heard about your situation from
Tina. Frank says to you, “Listen, I know this is none of my
business, but if I were you, I wouldn’t take Tina’s advice about
housing issues. (c) She was forced to leave her last apartment.”
Indeed, since Tina was evicted from (d) her last apartment, it
would appear as if what Frank says makes a lot of sense. But it
does not. That is because Frank is not attacking Tina’s advice;
instead, he is simply attacking her advice with emotion. In fact,
because (e) she has dealt with a fairly serious housing issue,
she might be considered a housing expert. Whether you like
her or not is a separate matter from whether she has good
advice or not. The credibility of advice should be based on
freedom from your biases.
