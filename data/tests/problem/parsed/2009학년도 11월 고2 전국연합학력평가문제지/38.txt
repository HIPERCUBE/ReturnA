38. It seems that the thing more difficult than telling a good joke
is teaching someone how to tell a good joke. But if someone is
telling me a funny story that actually happened, it makes me
laugh a lot more than something that is a made-up joke which
never happened. Therein lies my theory of good joke telling:
Great joke tellers make their own jokes by using what
happened around them and somehow incorporating it into their
jokes. This can be achieved by telling your joke that actually
happened to a friend, a family member, or even yourself.
