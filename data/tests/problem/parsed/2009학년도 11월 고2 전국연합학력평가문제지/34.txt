It does not make sense that the research of new seed
products is forbidden. Especially, it makes me so sad that
scientists are prevented from researching the seed products
for the purpose of public welfare. As you know, scientists are
qualified to test and analyze the seed products. But, if they are
stopped from doing researches, seed products which can cause
dangerous problems on public health could spread all over the
country. I agree that those products deserve to be protected
by intellectual property right, but I also believe that food
safety and environment protection should be a high priority.
Therefore, I strongly urge that the restriction on researching
on the seed products should be immediately removed.
