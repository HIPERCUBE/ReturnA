32. Because our busy schedules are hard to work around, many
families have trouble finding time to eat dinner together. But
we need to be aware of the importance of family meals.
Scientists have found interesting benefits to such meals.
According to them, if they eat with family members an average
of five to seven times weekly teenagers are seldom spoilt and
less likely to suffer from eating disorder. Family dinners are
also good for children’s language development. One more thing
to say is vegetables are certainly important for their health,
and children eat more of them when dining with their families.
Like most people, you probably have a busy schedule.
Nevertheless, family dinners are clearly well worth the time.
