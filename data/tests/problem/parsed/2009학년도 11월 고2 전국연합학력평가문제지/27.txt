27. In a study, fitness tests were done to 46 inactive women
divided into two groups. Regardless of how they had actually
performed on the fitness test, members of one group were told
they had scored in the highest of five levels of fitness, while
the others were told their performance was poor. All the
women were then asked to work out on stationary bikes.
Those who had been told they had scored well on the fitness
exam reported less fatigue than the women who believed they
had done poorly on the fitness test. Although the study was
small, its lesson is important: If you believe in your fitness
potential, you are likely to .
① become inactive as time passes
② live up to your own expectations
③ feel more depressed than before
④ need more sleep to work out well
⑤ become a good leader in your group
