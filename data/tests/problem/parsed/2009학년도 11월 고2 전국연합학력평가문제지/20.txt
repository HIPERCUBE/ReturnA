E-commerce is to the information revolution ①what the
railroad was to the industrial revolution. While the railroad

strengthens the move ③ to break up the big corporation of
today. But, the greatest strength of e-commerce is that it
provides the consumer with a whole range of products,
④whoever makes them. E-commerce separates, for the first

production but to distribution. There is absolutely no reason
why any e-commerce enterprise should limit ⑤ themselves to
marketing and selling one maker’s products.
