There is a road eight miles from the city up which I have
walked sometimes on my way to golf. I think it is called
Acacia Road; some pretty name like that. It may rain in Acacia
Road, but never when I am there. The sun shines on Leo
Lodge with its pink may tree, on the Cedars with its two clean
limes, it casts its shadow on the ivy of Holly House, and upon
the whole road there is a pleasant afternoon peace. I cannot
walk along Acacia Road without feeling that life could be very
happy in it―when the sun is shining. It must be jolly to live in
Leo Lodge with its pink may tree. Sometimes I fancy that a
suburban home is the true home after all.
