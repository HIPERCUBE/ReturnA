But points can be scored only in a limited number of right
ways, and the game is governed by an elaborate set of
rules.
Competition implies a set of rules that govern the conduct of
the opposed parties. ( ① ) It is one form of interaction that
occurs on all levels―the mutually opposed effort of two or
more persons to attain the same particular goal. ( ② ) In all
instances, however, cheating and physical force are not
permitted. ( ③ ) For example, when two competing college
football teams play against one another, each is striving to
attain the same goal―to score more points than the other
team. ( ④ ) Moreover, using professional players and
unnecessary roughness are both unacceptable forms of
behavior. ( ⑤ ) “Unrestricted competition” is therefore
impossible, because, by definition, all competition is restricted.
