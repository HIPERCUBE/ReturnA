37. tarsier에 관한 다음 글의 내용과일치하지 않는 것은?
The tarsier is a very peculiar small animal, no larger than an
adult man’s hand. It has enormous eyes; each eyeball is as
large as its entire brain. All tarsier species are nocturnal in
their habits, but some individuals may show more or less
activity during the daytime. Their primary food is insects, and
they catch insects by jumping at them. But they are also
known to prey on small animals, such as birds, snakes, lizards,
and bats. Although the practice of catching and selling them as
stuffed tarsiers to tourists has been stopped, the species is
still threatened by the destruction of its natural forest habitat.
If no action is taken, tarsiers will soon be added to the list of
extinct species.
