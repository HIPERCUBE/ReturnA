39. Most of us want this or that. We keep thinking about all that
we do not have, and we remain dissatisfied. Each time you
notice yourself falling into the “I wish life were different” trap,
take a step back and reconsider your life. Rather than
complaining about your salary, be grateful that you have a job.
Instead of wishing you were able to take a vacation to Hawaii,
think of ways you can enjoy yourself around home. Focus not
on what you want but on what you have. If you do, your life
will start appearing much better than before. For perhaps the
first time in your life, you will know what it means to feel
satisfied.
