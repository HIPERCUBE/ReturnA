When you know you have offended someone, you must take
corrective actions.①Choose an appropriate method, such as a
letter, an e-mail, a voice mail, a phone call, or speaking face
to face. ② If possible, apologize right away for little things like
bumping into someone. ③ In more serious cases, show your
regret with a statement such as “I am sorry. I felt bad the
minute I told you like that. I shouldn’t have done that.” ④ If
you recognize that your actions are praiseworthy, humbly
accept complimentary remarks. ⑤To be complete, an apology
should attempt to remedy the injury, whether it is someone’s
property or emotion that was hurt.
