26. A person trying to interpret a situation often looks at those
around him to see how he should react. If everyone else is
calm and indifferent, he will tend to remain so; if everyone
else is reacting strongly, he is likely to become stimulated.
However, occasionally the reactions of others can provide
. For example, the studied nonchalance
of patients in a dentist’s waiting room doesn’t show their inner
anxiety well. It is considered embarrassing to “lose your cool”
in public. In a potentially severe situation, then, everyone will
appear less concerned than he is in fact. A crowd can thus
force inaction on its members by implying that an event is not
an emergency. Any individual in such a crowd fears that he may
appear a fool if he behaves as though it were serious. [3점]
