33. Many individuals choose careers in healthcare out of a strong
humanitarian impulse. They often overlook the importance of
basic science, although science normally provides a clear
gateway to clinical practice. This can actually hinder obtaining
the most complete and well-rounded training experience. Many
students lean so much towards their clinical and field
experiences that they don’t consider how important science
should be to be an effective professional. They don’t see
scientific knowledge as an important skill to have. However,
anyone interested in a healthcare-related career must recognize
that basic science is an integral part of the healthcare system.
