24. In choosing one thing over another, we make a trade-off.
We give up one thing in order to have another. You and a
friend decide to go to a ball game. That decision has a cost
that goes beyond the price of your tickets. In going to the
game, you are also giving up the next best alternative. It is
what you would have done if you had not gone to the game.
For example, you might have spent the afternoon practicing
your jump shot. The of watching
the game was missing the practice. In short, whenever you
choose one thing over another, you give up the next best
option.
① financial profit ② risk management
③ opportunity cost ④ on-the-job training
