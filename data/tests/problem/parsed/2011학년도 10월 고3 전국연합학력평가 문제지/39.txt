39. Early human beings had to be good at exploring their 
surroundings and maintaining an intimate memory of edible and 
inedible plants, insects, and small animals, and the seasonal 
changes that conditioned their own hand‑to‑mouth survival. 
Primitive people were constantly observing the behavior of other 
animals and mimicking their behavior as if to incorporate it into 
the making of their own. Early man may have learned trapping 
from the spider, basket‑making from the birds’ nests, burrowing

and copy their ways; by imitating their diets and methods of 
getting food he multiplied his own chances of survival.
