37. Andrea McNichol에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Andrea McNichol works as a handwriting analyst now, but 
she was not good at handwriting in school. Her mother was 
always yelling at her about her handwriting. It never got 
hung on the walls like the other kids’. It was messy, ugly, 
and nothing like her mother’s — she used to win penmanship 
awards for hers. Andrea was an embarrassment to her 
mother. Now, some twenty years after graduating from 
college, she is on the witness stand in L.A. Superior Court, 
and the examining attorney is asking her, “Would you state 
your profession for the record, Ms. McNichol?” She responds, 
“I am a graphologist.” Yes, as ironic as it may sound, she 
now makes a living by using her knowledge of handwriting. 
She specializes in personality assessment via handwriting, and 
in authenticating handwriting on questioned documents.
