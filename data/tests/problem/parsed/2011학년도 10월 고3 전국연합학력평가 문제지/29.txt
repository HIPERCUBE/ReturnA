Common wisdom says that Internet social networking allows 
us to expand our circle of friends. However, a recent study 
says we’re as ① limited in our social contacts as we ever 
were. About twenty years ago, the British anthropologist, 
Robin Dunbar, observed a ②correlation between the sizes of 
primate brains and the number of social contacts. He concluded 
that humans can ③ handle regular contact with a number of 
friends somewhere between 100 and 200, and 150 became the 
standard Dunbar number for our species. Dunbar went on to 
say that this number has been ④ changeable throughout human 
history. For example, prehistoric hunter‑gatherer groups would 
split when they ⑤ surpassed 150 individuals in size, as well as 
other groupings such as academic subspecialties or working 
groups within corporations. * primate: 영장류
