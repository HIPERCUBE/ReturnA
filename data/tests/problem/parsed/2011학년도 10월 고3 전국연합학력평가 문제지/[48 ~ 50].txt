(A)
Michael Swenson loved to swim. In fact, every night 
after school he would go to the community pool and swim 
lap after lap just for pure enjoyment. One day (a)he saw 
an ad announcing a local swimming meet in a newspaper. 
Michael entered and continued to practice. It was a 
ten‑mile race across a lake. With only four weeks to 
prepare, Michael intensified his workouts.
(B)
Then something interesting happened. All the 
spectators congratulated the winner for his excellence 
but immediately turned their attention to Michael. A lady 
passing by who didn’t see the race was confused. She 
tapped a man on the shoulder and asked, “Why are they 
making such a big deal of this guy? He didn’t win!” The 
man turned to her and replied, “Because Michael would 
have easily won had (b)he had two arms!”
(C)
Race day finally came, and to Michael’s astonishment, 
hundreds of contestants had entered. On top of this 
pressure, thousands of people showed up to cheer for their 
favorite contenders. The swimmers were lined up, and the 
gun went off to start the race. Michael’s preparation and 
hard work paid off. At the five‑mile mark (c)he had a 
commanding lead. But then fatigue struck. Negative thoughts 
began flooding Michael’s head. I can’t make it. I’ll quit now.
(D)
As Michael slowed down, the second‑place swimmer started 
to make his move. (d)He swam to within one hundred yards 
of Michael. But Michael fought back. He was able to put the 
negative thoughts aside and push himself to greatness. (e)He 
decided that he wanted this victory, this glory. At the 
nine‑mile mark, the second‑place swimmer was now only 
thirty yards behind him. Michael knew it and pushed himself 
even harder. With only five yards to go, the second‑place 
contestant passed Michael and won the race. Both swimmers 
collapsed and lay in the sand gasping for breath.
