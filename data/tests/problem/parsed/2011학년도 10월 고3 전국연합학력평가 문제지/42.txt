42. The penguin has shiny feathers coated in natural oils 
which keep it waterproof and warm in the icy waters. Crude 
oil from a spill destroys these natural oils, and the penguin 
fails to protect itself from the cold. The bird is also liable 
to swallow poisonous oil and die since it preens its feathers 
using its beak. Sweaters are often used to keep penguins 
warm when they have just been rescued from an oil slick. 
Once penguins are rescued, they are cleaned, dressed in 
sweaters, and then put in salt‑water pools for rehabilitation. 
As they swim around and regain their strength, the salt 
water gradually destroys the wool. By the time the penguins 
are ready to return to the ocean, their natural oils will have 
come back, and they can go home dressed only in their 
feathers. * preen: (부리로) 다듬다
