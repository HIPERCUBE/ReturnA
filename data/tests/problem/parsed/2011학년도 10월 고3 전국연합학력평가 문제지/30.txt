Some linguists thought that some “primitive” languages 
were intermediate between animal languages and civilized 
ones. They (A) adopted / abandoned  this idea when they 
discovered that grammatical rules varied in complexity 
independently of social development. An American Indian 
l a n g u a g e ,   for example, has twice as many case endings as Latin. Other proposed characteristics of “primitive” languages, 
such as the (B) abuse / absence  of appropriately general 
words, proved to be unreliable indicators of evolutionary 
grades. The Agta of the Philippines have thirty‑one different 
verbs that refer to particular types of fishing. Yet they lack 
a generic word meaning “to fish.” In fact, they have no need 
to refer to fishing as a general activity for their living. 
Linguists realize that the failure of a language to have a 
general word is (C) relevant / irrelevant  to its evolutionary 
standing. * case ending: 격 변화 어미
