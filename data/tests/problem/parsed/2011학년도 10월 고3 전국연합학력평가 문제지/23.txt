Development strategies focus on economic growth without 
recognizing the role of functioning natural systems for local 
well‑being. This is because services that nature provides are 
often not visible. ① Wetlands are a good example; 
conserving wetlands appears to provide few benefits, and 
few economic costs are associated with their conservation 
and loss. ② Consequently, wetlands are converted in favor of 
more profitable options such as dams or irrigation schemes. 
③ Since the costs of running these dams do not fall 
correspondingly, the cost of generating a given amount of 
electricity rises. ④ But the problem is not that wetlands 
have no economic value, but that this value — e.g. waste 
water purification and water regulation — is poorly understood 
and frequently overlooked in decision‑making. ⑤ Local 
planners are often unaware that many natural solutions are 
available and are more cost‑effective than artificial solutions.
