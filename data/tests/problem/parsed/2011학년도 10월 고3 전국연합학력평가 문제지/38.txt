38. Heliotrop에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Heliotrop was built in 1994 by a German architect Rolf 
Disch for his home in Freigur, Germany. The most important 
characteristic of this house is its low energy consumption 
due to its ability to rotate according to the sun’s position as 
well as its solar energy production thanks to roof‑mounted 
solar panels. The cylindrical building is designed to face the 
sun with its triple‑pane windows during the cold months of 
the year and turn its highly insulated backside to the sun 
during the warmer months when heating isn’t necessary. As 
the house is exposed to the sun with the open front’s 
special windows, the maximum possible energy and light is 
let into it. Solar panels on its roof also rotate independently 
of the building to follow the sun. * insulate: 단열하다
