40. During busy times of the year, such as the Christmas holiday 
season, it’s easy to become preoccupied with the stresses of 
everyday life. The last thing on your mind might be what you’ll 
be doing in a couple of months, years, or decades. However, in 
one study of first‑semester college students, researchers found 
that those students who focused on their futures were more 
engaged in their academic pursuits. Although there is perhaps 
no period in life quite as stressful as the first year of college, 
students could be more engaged in what they were doing when 
they saw the big picture and avoided being weighed down by 
the strains of their present circumstances. Researchers believe 
that people who can project themselves into the future can get 
the most out of their lives right now because they see where 
it’s leading them.
