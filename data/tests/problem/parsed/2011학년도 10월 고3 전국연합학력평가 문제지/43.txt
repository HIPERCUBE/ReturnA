The settlement of the Latin American countryside took 
a different course from that of North America. The Latin 
Americans did not settle on individual family farms.
(A) The poorer people worked on these estates for low 
wages. They had little hope of ever owning their own 
land. The landowners also forced the native Indians to 
work on the haciendas and later imported millions of 
African slaves for the same purpose.
(B) That’s because the government did not promote private 
ownership of land. Wealthy men owned most of the 
land, from which they made huge estates, called 
haciendas.

their land or using it wisely. Their attitude kept the 
workers in poverty and the land undeveloped, and led 
many Latin American nations to remain agricultural.
