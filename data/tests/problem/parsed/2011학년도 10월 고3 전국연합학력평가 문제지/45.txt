Sandra Lee, who is famous for her Semi‑Homemade, 
understands the delicate balance between the desire to 
feel the pride of ownership and the wish not to spend 
too much time in the kitchen. According to Lee, 
housewives can feel the joy of creation while saving 
time by using ready‑made products for seventy percent 
of the process (cake mix, store‑bought minced garlic, a 
jar of marinara sauce) and thirty percent “fresh, creative 
touches” (a bit of honey and vanilla in the cake mix, or 
fresh eggs and vegetables instead of dried ones). 
Housewives can combine off‑the‑shelf products with just 
the right amount of personalization. Lee’s TV show, 
magazine, and numerous cookbooks offer evidence that a 
spoonful of ownership is a crucial ingredient in the 
psychological exercise that is cooking.

While I was staying at a world‑renowned hotel in 
Bogota, Colombia, the general manager commented to me 
that he had recently hired some new hotel guards, and 
although he couldn’t put his finger on it, there was 
something about them he didn’t like. He knew that I had 
worked in law enforcement for the FBI, and he asked 
whether I had noticed anything bothersome about his 
new staff members. We walked outside where the guards 
were posted and took a quick glance. The manager noted 
that although they had new uniforms and their boots 
were shined, something wasn’t right. I agreed that the 
uniforms looked professional, but pointed out that the 
guards were standing with their thumbs in their pockets, 
making them look weak and incompetent.
At first the manager didn’t seem to grasp what I was 
saying until I had him demonstrate the posture himself. 
Immediately he said, “You are right. They look like little 
kids waiting for their mother to tell them what to eat and 
what to wear.” The next day the guards were shown how 
to stand and look authoritative (hands behind back, chin 
up) without looking threatening to the guests. Sometimes 
little things mean a lot. In this case, the disappearing 
thumbs became indicators which showed                 
— not exactly what you want from a security force, 
especially in Bogota, Colombia.

(A)
Michael Swenson loved to swim. In fact, every night 
after school he would go to the community pool and swim 
lap after lap just for pure enjoyment. One day (a)he saw 
an ad announcing a local swimming meet in a newspaper. 
Michael entered and continued to practice. It was a 
ten‑mile race across a lake. With only four weeks to 
prepare, Michael intensified his workouts.
(B)
Then something interesting happened. All the 
spectators congratulated the winner for his excellence 
but immediately turned their attention to Michael. A lady 
passing by who didn’t see the race was confused. She 
tapped a man on the shoulder and asked, “Why are they 
making such a big deal of this guy? He didn’t win!” The 
man turned to her and replied, “Because Michael would 
have easily won had (b)he had two arms!”
(C)
Race day finally came, and to Michael’s astonishment, 
hundreds of contestants had entered. On top of this 
pressure, thousands of people showed up to cheer for their 
favorite contenders. The swimmers were lined up, and the 
gun went off to start the race. Michael’s preparation and 
hard work paid off. At the five‑mile mark (c)he had a 
commanding lead. But then fatigue struck. Negative thoughts 
began flooding Michael’s head. I can’t make it. I’ll quit now.
(D)
As Michael slowed down, the second‑place swimmer started 
to make his move. (d)He swam to within one hundred yards 
of Michael. But Michael fought back. He was able to put the 
negative thoughts aside and push himself to greatness. (e)He 
decided that he wanted this victory, this glory. At the 
nine‑mile mark, the second‑place swimmer was now only 
thirty yards behind him. Michael knew it and pushed himself 
even harder. With only five yards to go, the second‑place 
contestant passed Michael and won the race. Both swimmers 
collapsed and lay in the sand gasping for breath.
