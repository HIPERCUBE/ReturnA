26. A social function of religion is to prompt reflection concerning 
conduct. In this context, religion plays a role in social control, 
which does not rely on law alone. Religion sets guidelines for 
acceptable behavior. This is done through notions of right and 
wrong, good and evil. Usually, religious myths feature tales of 
supernatural beings that in various ways illustrate the society’s 
ethical code in action. Right actions earn the approval of the 
supernatural power which is recognized by a particular culture. 
Wrong actions may cause punishment through supernatural 
agencies. In short, by raising people’s feelings of guilt and 
anxiety about their actions, religion                          .

32. If you establish an adequate baseline by observing a 
specific individual’s arm behaviors over a period of time, 
you can detect how he is feeling by his arm movements.  
(A)   , arm movements can let you know how someone is 
feeling upon returning home from work. When a person feels 
discouraged or sad after a tough day, his arms will be low at 
his side, shoulders drooping. Armed with this understanding, 
you can comfort the person and help him recover from a hard 
day. (B) , watch people being reunited after a long 
absence. They hold their open arms straight out. The meaning 
is clear, “Come here, I want to hold you!” Our arms reach 
out, defying gravity and opening up our entire body, because 
our feelings are so genuinely positive.
(A) (B)

33. 다음 글에 드러난 Shay의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
Shay and his father were walking past a park where some 
boys Shay knew were playing baseball. “Do you think they’ll 
let me play?” Shay anxiously asked his father although he 
knew they wouldn’t let him join them because of his 
handicap. How many times had he been denied playing in a 
game since he hurt his leg severely three years ago? Shay’s 
father looked at his son, overwhelmed with pity. He 
approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay 
could play, not expecting much. The boy looked at Shay and 
said, “We’re losing by six runs, and the game is in the eighth 
inning. I guess he can be on our team, and we’ll try to put 
him in to bat in the ninth inning.” Shay struggled over to the 
team’s bench and put on a team shirt with a broad smile on 
his face and tears in his eyes.

34. I once visited a ski resort while our company was producing 
one of our first televised ski races. Upon arriving, I 
immediately looked for the head of our television division who 
was overseeing the event. To my surprise, I was told he was 
out on the side of the mountain setting up camera angles with 
the crew. That would have been an acceptable place for him 
to be if he had still been a producer. But as a division head, I 
expected him to be at the base of the mountain, directing the 
event on the whole. Because he hadn’t grasped his new 
position, this executive went back to the old, comfortable 
position without realizing that his new position required him to 
sacrifice some of his old ways.

35. When we start designing something, we sketch out ideas 
with a big, thick marker, instead of a ball‑point pen. Why? 
Pen points are too fine. They encourage you to worry about 
things that you shouldn’t worry about yet, like perfecting the 
shading or whether to use a dotted or dashed line. You end 
up focusing on things that should still be out of focus. A 
marker makes it impossible to drill down that deep. You can 
only draw shapes, lines, and boxes. That’s good. The big 
picture is all you should be worrying about in the beginning. 
You need to approach your idea in the same way. Getting 
obsessed with details too early leads to disagreement, 
meetings, and delays. You get lost in things that don’t really 
matter. You waste your time on decisions that are going to 
change anyway.

② Don’t Leave It to Chance
③ Loud Action, Little Success

Andrea McNichol works as a handwriting analyst now, but 
she was not good at handwriting in school. Her mother was 
always yelling at her about her handwriting. It never got 
hung on the walls like the other kids’. It was messy, ugly, 
and nothing like her mother’s — she used to win penmanship 
awards for hers. Andrea was an embarrassment to her 
mother. Now, some twenty years after graduating from 
college, she is on the witness stand in L.A. Superior Court, 
and the examining attorney is asking her, “Would you state 
your profession for the record, Ms. McNichol?” She responds, 
“I am a graphologist.” Yes, as ironic as it may sound, she 
now makes a living by using her knowledge of handwriting. 
She specializes in personality assessment via handwriting, and 
in authenticating handwriting on questioned documents.

38. Heliotrop에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Heliotrop was built in 1994 by a German architect Rolf 
Disch for his home in Freigur, Germany. The most important 
characteristic of this house is its low energy consumption 
due to its ability to rotate according to the sun’s position as 
well as its solar energy production thanks to roof‑mounted 
solar panels. The cylindrical building is designed to face the 
sun with its triple‑pane windows during the cold months of 
the year and turn its highly insulated backside to the sun 
during the warmer months when heating isn’t necessary. As 
the house is exposed to the sun with the open front’s 
special windows, the maximum possible energy and light is 
let into it. Solar panels on its roof also rotate independently 
of the building to follow the sun. * insulate: 단열하다

39. Early human beings had to be good at exploring their 
surroundings and maintaining an intimate memory of edible and 
inedible plants, insects, and small animals, and the seasonal 
changes that conditioned their own hand‑to‑mouth survival. 
Primitive people were constantly observing the behavior of other 
animals and mimicking their behavior as if to incorporate it into 
the making of their own. Early man may have learned trapping 
from the spider, basket‑making from the birds’ nests, burrowing 
from rabbits, and the art of using poison from snakes. Unlike 
most species, man did not hesitate to learn from other creatures 
and copy their ways; by imitating their diets and methods of 
getting food he multiplied his own chances of survival.

40. During busy times of the year, such as the Christmas holiday 
season, it’s easy to become preoccupied with the stresses of 
everyday life. The last thing on your mind might be what you’ll 
be doing in a couple of months, years, or decades. However, in 
one study of first‑semester college students, researchers found 
that those students who focused on their futures were more 
engaged in their academic pursuits. Although there is perhaps 
no period in life quite as stressful as the first year of college, 
students could be more engaged in what they were doing when 
they saw the big picture and avoided being weighed down by 
the strains of their present circumstances. Researchers believe 
that people who can project themselves into the future can get 
the most out of their lives right now because they see where 
it’s leading them.

41. Stories have long been used as instruments of persuasion. 
Aesop used his fables to lead people toward a certain moral 
code. The persuasive power of stories certainly hasn’t been lost 
on advertisers. A vast number of TV commercials, for example, 
pack miniature stories into the briefest of clips. The reason 
why these fictional words and actions can powerfully impact our 
attitudes and behavior is that fiction doesn’t feel persuasive. 
Even when it’s been created with that goal, it’s easy to lose 
sight of its original purpose and simply sink into the experience 
of being entertained. Many people automatically activate a 
defensive system when they detect that a message has 
persuasive intent. Miniature fiction is probably one of the best 
ways to mask the true persuasive nature of advertising.
① establishing moral codes through stories
② why using fiction is effective in advertising
③ how to incorporate personal experiences in advertising
④ protecting customers from being deceived by advertisers

42. The penguin has shiny feathers coated in natural oils 
which keep it waterproof and warm in the icy waters. Crude 
oil from a spill destroys these natural oils, and the penguin 
fails to protect itself from the cold. The bird is also liable 
to swallow poisonous oil and die since it preens its feathers 
using its beak. Sweaters are often used to keep penguins 
warm when they have just been rescued from an oil slick. 
Once penguins are rescued, they are cleaned, dressed in 
sweaters, and then put in salt‑water pools for rehabilitation. 
As they swim around and regain their strength, the salt 
water gradually destroys the wool. By the time the penguins 
are ready to return to the ocean, their natural oils will have 
come back, and they can go home dressed only in their 
feathers. * preen: (부리로) 다듬다
① the functions of penguins’ natural oils
② the value of protecting penguins’ habitat
③ dangers penguins face in polluted waters
④ the impact of oil spills on the environment

The settlement of the Latin American countryside took 
a different course from that of North America. The Latin 
Americans did not settle on individual family farms.
(A) The poorer people worked on these estates for low 
wages. They had little hope of ever owning their own 
land. The landowners also forced the native Indians to 
work on the haciendas and later imported millions of 
African slaves for the same purpose.
(B) That’s because the government did not promote private 
ownership of land. Wealthy men owned most of the 
land, from which they made huge estates, called 
haciendas.
(C) Many of the owners, however, cared little for developing 
their land or using it wisely. Their attitude kept the 
workers in poverty and the land undeveloped, and led 
many Latin American nations to remain agricultural.

People themselves also differ in their ability to taste and 
in their tolerance of certain plants.
We know that the taste of a particular plant from one place 
may differ slightly from that of the same plant at another 
place. ( ① ) This is due to genetic variation usually 
manifested in differing characteristics. ( ② ) Thus, the degree 
of bitterness or mildness in many members of the mustard 
and daisy families can be attributed to natural genetic 
variations. ( ③ ) Chemical composition of the soil along with 
other substances added by man or animals can affect the taste 
of some plants, especially smaller herbs. ( ④ ) While some 
people enjoy dandelion leaves, others may hate them. ( ⑤ ) 
You might acquire a taste for certain edible plants only after 
experimenting with harvest and preparation techniques.

Sandra Lee, who is famous for her Semi‑Homemade, 
understands the delicate balance between the desire to 
feel the pride of ownership and the wish not to spend 
too much time in the kitchen. According to Lee, 
housewives can feel the joy of creation while saving 
time by using ready‑made products for seventy percent 
of the process (cake mix, store‑bought minced garlic, a 
jar of marinara sauce) and thirty percent “fresh, creative 
touches” (a bit of honey and vanilla in the cake mix, or 
fresh eggs and vegetables instead of dried ones). 
Housewives can combine off‑the‑shelf products with just 
the right amount of personalization. Lee’s TV show, 
magazine, and numerous cookbooks offer evidence that a 
spoonful of ownership is a crucial ingredient in the 
psychological exercise that is cooking.
