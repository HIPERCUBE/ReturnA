My friends always ask me, “Isn’t math talent something
that you are born with?” ①They believe that I am highly
gifted. ②Maybe I was born with some curiosity about how
things work, whether it is a math problem or a magic trick.
③There are so many math teachers who can do magic
tricks. ④ But from my teaching experiences, I am sure that
rapid math is a skill that anyone can learn. ⑤And like any
useful skills, it takes time and effort if you wish to become
an expert.
