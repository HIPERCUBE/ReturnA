English is not an easy language to spell. There are 26
letters in the alphabet and about 45 basic sounds. The
letters seldom match the sounds! (A) , one specific
sound can be spelled in a number of different ways. To
make the problem worse, a single letter may represent any
one of a variety of sounds. (B) , a stands for one
sound in day, and another in hat. Similarly, two vowels used
together can represent different sounds, as with the ou in
soul, and the ou in tough.
