However, despite these benefits, safety issues have been
raised about these green vehicles.
Electric cars have many advantages compared to
traditional ones. ( ① ) They do not cause air pollution and
global warming by emitting carbon dioxide. ( ② ) They also

electric car coming. ( ④ ) So it could be dangerous to some
pedestrians, especially the blind. ( ⑤ ) In response to this
concern, groups of scholars, blind people, and police insist
that a sound­making function should be introduced in these
eco­friendly vehicles.
