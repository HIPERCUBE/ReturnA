(A) It was my mother’s first visit since the death of my
husband with cancer. I arrived at Portland airport to
discover that her flight had been delayed. So I decided to
sit down and have coffee. Then (a) a woman came in and
also ordered coffee. I asked which flight she was waiting
for. Susan, as she introduced herself, was waiting for the
same plane. We both said that we had forgotten to check
arrival times before heading for the airport.
(B) On the way, she told me she, too, had lost her
husband to cancer. (b) She gave me a lovely lunch. Later
we found there had been further delays. We ended up
spending the whole day before it was time to head back.
The plane finally arrived at midnight, so it would have
been a very long wait alone.
(C) That was 12 years ago. (c) Susan and I still contact
each other and we have spent many happy times together
since our first meeting at the airport. She has become a
wonderful friend I can rely on whenever needed. I will be
forever thankful that we both forgot to check the flight
arrivals that day.
(D) Afterwards we headed for the information desk and
asked an airline worker. (d) She told us that the flight had
been delayed eight hours. I didn’t want to drive home and
back again. Neither did I want to sit at the airport all that
time. Susan said (e) she was going home and asked if I’d
like to go home with her until the flight arrived. “That
would be lovely,” I replied.
