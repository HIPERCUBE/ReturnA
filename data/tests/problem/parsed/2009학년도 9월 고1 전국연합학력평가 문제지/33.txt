33. Life is like a river for many people. They just jump in the
river of life without ever knowing where they want to go.
They quickly get caught up in the flow of the river. When
they come to a fork in the river, they find it difficult to
decide which way to go by themselves. So they just go the
same way that everyone else goes without paying attention
to their own values and goals. All of a sudden they are too
close to a waterfall, and they realize it’s too late to change
course. In almost all of the cases, they could have avoided
the fall by making better decisions upstream.
