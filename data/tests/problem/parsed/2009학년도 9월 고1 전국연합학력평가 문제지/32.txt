32. People from warmer regions tend to use hand gestures
more than people from colder ones. In Europe, this means
people from the southern countries like Greece gesture more
than people from northern ones like Sweden. The reason for
this cultural difference can be simply explained. The hands
are the main source for gesturing. In extremely cold

coat pocket while speaking. On the other hand, in warmer
climates, a person doesn’t have to do this. She can use her
hands freely to emphasize what she’s saying.
