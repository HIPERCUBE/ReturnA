Some elementary school teachers in the U.S. might be
thinking “Recess is free time for the students.” or “Why
should I care about recess?” In reality, recess has
become more important than ever. Since physical
education at the elementary level has seen a decline in
recent years, recess has in fact become for
children to participate in physical activity in school.
With this in mind, what should happen during recess is
that students have a chance to participate in physical
activity in a setting that is helpful for learning. What
actually occurs is that students are left to engage in
unorganized activities during this ‘free time.’
As a matter of fact, recess is much more than free
time. Recess should be viewed as an opportunity for
students not only to engage in physical activity, but also
to build their character and develop social interaction
skills. Therefore, the classroom teachers must realize
that recess is an important part of the school day.
