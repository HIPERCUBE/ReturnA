18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
[1점]
This means the ability to continue doing something even if
you do not see any results immediately. We can see this in
a teacher who works with young children. She may not be
feeling very well that day, but she smiles and does not get
angry when a child misbehaves. We can see this in a clerk
who is polite to a customer even though the clerk has
already been at work for seven or eight hours. In our
modern society, people often lack this. People nowadays
expect immediate results all the time.
