Phillips’ discovery can be represented in a curve called the
Phillips Curve. Notice that the inflation rate is represented
on the ① vertical axis in units of percent per year. The
unemployment rate is represented on the ② horizontal axis
in units of percent. The curve shows the levels of inflation
and unemployment that tend to ③match together
approximately, based on historical data. As unemployment
rises, inflation ④ increases in this curve. An unemployment
rate of 7% seems to correspond to an inflation rate of 4%
