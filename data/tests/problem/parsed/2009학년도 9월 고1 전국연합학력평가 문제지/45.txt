45. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A)와
(B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
There were two fathers I knew. Although both of them
worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting
his brain to sleep when it came to money matters, and the
other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long­term
result was that one dad grew weaker and the other grew
stronger financially. It is not much different from a person
who sits on the couch watching television versus someone
who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis. Proper
physical exercise increases your chances for health, and
proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth.
You need to develop and nurture your (A) skills
regularly just like your (B) strength.
(A) (B)
① academic …… mental
② academic …… physical
③ financial …… physical
④ financial …… emotional
⑤ technical …… mental
