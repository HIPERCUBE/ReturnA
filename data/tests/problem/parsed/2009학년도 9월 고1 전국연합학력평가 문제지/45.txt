There were two fathers I knew. Although both of them
worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting
his brain to sleep when it came to money matters, and the
other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long­term
result was that one dad grew weaker and the other grew
stronger financially. It is not much different from a person
who sits on the couch watching television versus someone
who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis. Proper
physical exercise increases your chances for health, and
proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth.
You need to develop and nurture your (A) skills
regularly just like your (B) strength.
(A) (B)
① academic …… mental
② academic …… physical
③ financial …… physical
④ financial …… emotional
⑤ technical …… mental

(A) It was my mother’s first visit since the death of my
husband with cancer. I arrived at Portland airport to
discover that her flight had been delayed. So I decided to
sit down and have coffee. Then (a) a woman came in and
also ordered coffee. I asked which flight she was waiting
for. Susan, as she introduced herself, was waiting for the
same plane. We both said that we had forgotten to check
arrival times before heading for the airport.
(B) On the way, she told me she, too, had lost her
husband to cancer. (b) She gave me a lovely lunch. Later
we found there had been further delays. We ended up
spending the whole day before it was time to head back.
The plane finally arrived at midnight, so it would have
been a very long wait alone.
(C) That was 12 years ago. (c) Susan and I still contact
each other and we have spent many happy times together
since our first meeting at the airport. She has become a
wonderful friend I can rely on whenever needed. I will be
forever thankful that we both forgot to check the flight
arrivals that day.
(D) Afterwards we headed for the information desk and
asked an airline worker. (d) She told us that the flight had
been delayed eight hours. I didn’t want to drive home and
back again. Neither did I want to sit at the airport all that
time. Susan said (e) she was going home and asked if I’d
like to go home with her until the flight arrived. “That
would be lovely,” I replied.

Some elementary school teachers in the U.S. might be
thinking “Recess is free time for the students.” or “Why
should I care about recess?” In reality, recess has
become more important than ever. Since physical
education at the elementary level has seen a decline in
recent years, recess has in fact become for
children to participate in physical activity in school.
With this in mind, what should happen during recess is
that students have a chance to participate in physical
activity in a setting that is helpful for learning. What
actually occurs is that students are left to engage in
unorganized activities during this ‘free time.’
As a matter of fact, recess is much more than free
time. Recess should be viewed as an opportunity for
students not only to engage in physical activity, but also
to build their character and develop social interaction
skills. Therefore, the classroom teachers must realize
that recess is an important part of the school day.
* recess: 쉬는 시간
