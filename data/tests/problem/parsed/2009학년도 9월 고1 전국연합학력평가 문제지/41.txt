41. One researcher has argued that doctors and patients talk
to each other with different voices. The voices of doctors
are characterized by medical terms that describe physical
symptoms. The voices of patients, on the other hand, often
include non­technical terms about how they feel and how
they live their lives. Typically, doctors have more power
than patients in the interaction between them. As a result,
patients may feel that their voices are ignored or silenced.
