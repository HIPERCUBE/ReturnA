42. Dinosaurs are often shown in movies as huge monsters,
the size of skyscrapers. They may be given amazing powers,
like the ability to breathe fire, or incredible physical
strength. But there is no scientific evidence to support such
reconstructions. Although dinosaurs were large, no known
dinosaur was over 165 feet long. The Velociraptors in
Jurassic Park were described as far larger than the real
animals to make them seem even scarier. The idea of
fire­breathing dinosaurs probably comes from the old stories
of imaginary monsters such as dragons. Dinosaurs and
dragons were both large― but dinosaurs were real, whereas
dragons were not.
