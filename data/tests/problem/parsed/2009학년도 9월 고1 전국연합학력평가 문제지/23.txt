23. Vancouver Olympic organizers announced that they cannot
allow women ski jumpers to compete next year. Fifteen
female ski jumpers are in the British Columbia Supreme
Court this week, insisting that the court should order the
Vancouver Organizing Committee either to hold women’s ski
jumping in 2010 or to cancel all ski jumping events. While
three men’s events are planned at next February’s Games,
none are included for women. The women argue that their
by the International Olympic Committee is against
Canadian human rights laws.
