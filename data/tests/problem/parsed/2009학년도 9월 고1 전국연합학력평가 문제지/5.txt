This means the ability to continue doing something even if
you do not see any results immediately. We can see this in
a teacher who works with young children. She may not be
feeling very well that day, but she smiles and does not get
angry when a child misbehaves. We can see this in a clerk
who is polite to a customer even though the clerk has
already been at work for seven or eight hours. In our
modern society, people often lack this. People nowadays
expect immediate results all the time.

lazy. And ② he acted like a spoiled kid, too. But Mr. Gibson
had noticed something else. A lot of the time, the boy
looked sad. For two weeks, ③ he hadn’t made even one
friend. This year’s fifth­graders were some of the nicest

23. Vancouver Olympic organizers announced that they cannot
allow women ski jumpers to compete next year. Fifteen
female ski jumpers are in the British Columbia Supreme
Court this week, insisting that the court should order the
Vancouver Organizing Committee either to hold women’s ski
jumping in 2010 or to cancel all ski jumping events. While
three men’s events are planned at next February’s Games,
none are included for women. The women argue that their

Canadian human rights laws.

24. On October 30, 1938, the Earth was invaded by creatures
from Mars! Or at least that’s what thousands of radio
listeners believed in the United States. Some rushed to the
roads to escape, and others hid in their basements. Actually,
on that evening, Orson Welles directed and starred in a
radio broadcast, The War of the Worlds. The radio play was
based on a book of the same title by H. G. Wells, an English
writer. It described a fictional attack on New Jersey by
invaders from Mars. The broadcast was not of a real event
— but it seemed so real that it . It
was not surprising that many radio listeners believed what
they heard on the radio in those days.

25. Ironically, the Alps are becoming victims of .
In a strange twist of fate, this vast and beautiful European
mountain chain is being destroyed by the very tourists it
attracts. Every year, 20 million skiers visit the Alps. The
Alpine roads are blocked by many vacationers in traffic
jams. Off the roads, the Alpine area is threatened by the
flood of very noisy motorcycles, off­road vehicles,
snowmobiles and helicopters. Moreover, snow guns create
artificial surfaces for skiers, which breaks the weak Alpine
environment.

26. In the South American rain forest, there is a tribe called
the Desana. They see the world as a fixed amount of
energy that flows between all creatures. Therefore, every
birth must replace a death, and every death brings about
another birth. This way, the energy of the world .
When they hunt for food, the Desana believe that the
animals they kill will leave a hole in the spiritual world. But
that hole will be filled by the souls of the hunters when
they die. If there were no men dying, there would be no
birds or fish being born.

27. It seems that we cannot go a day without hearing about
or using ‘LED’(Light­Emitting Diode). Many third­generation
mobile phones, the latest television sets and notebook
computers include LEDs. So what exactly are LEDs?
Basically, they are an advanced electronic light source that
presents numerous advantages over traditional lamps. LEDs
are not only smaller and lighter compared to fluorescent
lamps, but they also use less energy, last much longer and
have a clearer contrast and sharper colors. In other words,
LEDs are .

I put the bag of food inside my shirt. I tried to look calm
with a paper bag down the front of my shirt, walking
towards the fence. I was about fifty feet from the fence
when I heard Milo shout, “Hey, you! Come back here!” I
started running for the fence. Milo screamed again. “Come
back here or I’ll send my dog after you!” That only made
me run even faster for the fence. And Milo yelled, “Get him,
Chopper! Go and get him!” I threw the bag over the fence.
Behind me, I could hear Chopper coming, shaking the earth,
breathing fire and ice from his nose.

30. 다음 The Phillips Curve에 대한 글의 내용 중, 밑줄 친 낱말
의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?
Phillips’ discovery can be represented in a curve called the
Phillips Curve. Notice that the inflation rate is represented
on the ① vertical axis in units of percent per year. The
unemployment rate is represented on the ② horizontal axis
in units of percent. The curve shows the levels of inflation
and unemployment that tend to ③match together
approximately, based on historical data. As unemployment
rises, inflation ④ increases in this curve. An unemployment
rate of 7% seems to correspond to an inflation rate of 4%
while an unemployment rate of 2% seems to ⑤ correspond
to an inflation rate of 6%.

English is not an easy language to spell. There are 26
letters in the alphabet and about 45 basic sounds. The
letters seldom match the sounds! (A) , one specific
sound can be spelled in a number of different ways. To
make the problem worse, a single letter may represent any
one of a variety of sounds. (B) , a stands for one
sound in day, and another in hat. Similarly, two vowels used
together can represent different sounds, as with the ou in
soul, and the ou in tough.

32. People from warmer regions tend to use hand gestures
more than people from colder ones. In Europe, this means
people from the southern countries like Greece gesture more
than people from northern ones like Sweden. The reason for
this cultural difference can be simply explained. The hands
are the main source for gesturing. In extremely cold
climates, a person is more likely to keep her hands in her
coat pocket while speaking. On the other hand, in warmer
climates, a person doesn’t have to do this. She can use her
hands freely to emphasize what she’s saying.

33. Life is like a river for many people. They just jump in the
river of life without ever knowing where they want to go.
They quickly get caught up in the flow of the river. When
they come to a fork in the river, they find it difficult to
decide which way to go by themselves. So they just go the
same way that everyone else goes without paying attention
to their own values and goals. All of a sudden they are too
close to a waterfall, and they realize it’s too late to change
course. In almost all of the cases, they could have avoided
the fall by making better decisions upstream.

Nowadays it seems there are fewer places to take a walk
in the city. Meanwhile, with remote controls and computers,
we can have just about anything we want without even
getting out of our chair. Physical activity is so rare that
experts suggest you should do some sort of extra movement
throughout the day. Next time when you go shopping, park
at the far end of the lot instead of next to the door. Get rid
of the remote control so that changing the channel means
getting off the couch. Take a few flights of stairs instead of
using the elevator.

Gary Paulsen was born on May 17, 1939 in Minnesota,
USA shortly after his father, an army officer, left for duty
in war­torn Europe. He spent the years of World War II
partly with his mother in Chicago, who worked in a factory,
and partly with relatives in Minnesota. Paulsen did not meet
his father until 1946 when he and his mother were reunited
with his father in the Philippines. He spent his youth moving
frequently, staying no longer than five months in any school,
and often spent long periods with relatives such as a
grandmother or an aunt.

Koreans have a long history of papermaking and have
always used native good­quality paper. Korea’s oldest paper,
called Maji, was made from hemp. Maji is produced using
the following steps. First, small pieces of hemp are soaked
in water for some time and then cut into tiny pieces. Next,
these pieces are turned into a slippery pulp by using a
grindstone. After that, it is steamed, cleansed with water,
ground again and placed in a tank. This raw material is
pressed onto a frame and sun­dried while being whitened.
This method of papermaking was most popular during the
Three Kingdoms period.

38. Many teenagers spend hours online. They move from site
to site, check e­mails and chat with their friends. Are they
reading? Well, reading should be an activity that requires
focused attention for an extended period of time. When you
read books, you create pictures in your mind to go along
with the story. So reading books is a mentally stimulating
activity. But a lot of the reading that we do online is not
the same sustained, focused reading that we do when we
read books. If you spend most of your time online, then
you’re not getting the full benefits of reading.

39. Humans are exceptionally good at recognizing faces
they’ve seen before. It doesn’t take much effort to
accurately recall whether you’ve seen a particular face or
not. However, this doesn’t work out when faces come from
unfamiliar races. A white person who lives primarily among
other whites will have more difficulty recognizing Asian
faces, and vice versa. That’s why people need more
experience to recognize the faces of other races. It is as
difficult as recognizing any new category of objects such as
cars and birds.

However, despite these benefits, safety issues have been
raised about these green vehicles.
Electric cars have many advantages compared to
traditional ones. ( ① ) They do not cause air pollution and
global warming by emitting carbon dioxide. ( ② ) They also
produce less noise pollution because they run quietly on
battery power. ( ③ ) For example, it is difficult to hear an
electric car coming. ( ④ ) So it could be dangerous to some
pedestrians, especially the blind. ( ⑤ ) In response to this
concern, groups of scholars, blind people, and police insist
that a sound­making function should be introduced in these
eco­friendly vehicles.

41. One researcher has argued that doctors and patients talk
to each other with different voices. The voices of doctors
are characterized by medical terms that describe physical
symptoms. The voices of patients, on the other hand, often
include non­technical terms about how they feel and how
they live their lives. Typically, doctors have more power
than patients in the interaction between them. As a result,
patients may feel that their voices are ignored or silenced.

42. Dinosaurs are often shown in movies as huge monsters,
the size of skyscrapers. They may be given amazing powers,
like the ability to breathe fire, or incredible physical
strength. But there is no scientific evidence to support such
reconstructions. Although dinosaurs were large, no known
dinosaur was over 165 feet long. The Velociraptors in
Jurassic Park were described as far larger than the real
animals to make them seem even scarier. The idea of
fire­breathing dinosaurs probably comes from the old stories
of imaginary monsters such as dragons. Dinosaurs and
dragons were both large― but dinosaurs were real, whereas
dragons were not.

On the island of New Guinea live some of the most

paradise.’

that they don’t fly far from their homes because of the

Natural History, researched these birds and found that
there are more than 90 kinds of ‘birds of paradise’ on New

There were two fathers I knew. Although both of them
worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting
his brain to sleep when it came to money matters, and the
other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long­term
result was that one dad grew weaker and the other grew
stronger financially. It is not much different from a person
who sits on the couch watching television versus someone
who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis. Proper
physical exercise increases your chances for health, and
proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth.
