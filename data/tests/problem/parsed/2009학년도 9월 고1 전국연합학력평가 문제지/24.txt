24. On October 30, 1938, the Earth was invaded by creatures
from Mars! Or at least that’s what thousands of radio
listeners believed in the United States. Some rushed to the

invaders from Mars. The broadcast was not of a real event

was not surprising that many radio listeners believed what
they heard on the radio in those days.
