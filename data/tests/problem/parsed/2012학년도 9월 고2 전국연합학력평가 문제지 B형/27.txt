27. Climate change might hit us in the most important place of
all― . Why do we care about climate change?
There are many environmental problems caused by climate
change, but they might not be as important as the impact
that it might have on the most vital function of any species:
feeding itself. Since the human population broke the 7 billion
mark late last year, feeding the growing population is the
greatest challenge to humanity. That’s why the threat that
climate change could mess with agriculture is so scary. In
last week’s Science, an international group of leading
investigators published an open letter urging policymakers to
ensure that agriculture becomes a more vital part of global
action against climate change. “Global agriculture must
produce more food to feed a growing population,” they write.
“Yet scientific assessments point to climate change as a
growing threat to agricultural yields and food security.”
