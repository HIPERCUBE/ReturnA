Even if you expect the ①majority of your readers to
understand your native language, you may be tempted to use
English when writing about research work. Usually
researchers all over the world know English and use it a lot,
and often the relevant terminology is more ②well-known in
English than in your own language. Thus, to ③maximize the
number of interested people that can understand your text,
you often select English even if a great number of your
readers have the same native language as you. Alternatively,
you might write your texts both in your native language and
in English, and this ④ reduces the work needed for writing
your document and possibly maintaining it. The maintenance
problem is especially important for documents on the Web―the
information system where one crucial feature is the ability to
keep things really ⑤ up-to-date. Consequently, the use of
English in essentially national environments tends to grow.
