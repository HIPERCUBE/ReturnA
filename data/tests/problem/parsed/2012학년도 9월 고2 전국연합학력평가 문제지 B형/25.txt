The sociobiologist E. O. Wilson, from his studies of ants,
showed how it was often an evolutionary advantage for a
single animal to die to protect its relatives, since they too
shared the same genes. ①Moreover, it was also sometimes
an advantage for an individual animal not to have offspring
directly, but instead to devote its life to taking care of
siblings or cousins, which again shared the same genes. ② In
this way, ultimately, that animal’s own genes would survive
and be passed on. ③ In ant societies, self-sacrificing
behavior could sometimes become an evolutionary advantage.
④Ants attack their enemies by biting, stinging, often
injecting or spraying chemicals, which helps to protect their
societies. ⑤Survival of the fittest didn’t necessarily mean the
biggest and strongest, but the one which was best able to
make sure that its genes were passed on.
