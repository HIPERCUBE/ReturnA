28. You’ve just found the perfect house in the perfect neighborhood.
Of course you’re excited, but “ .”
No matter how much you want that house, if you don’t bring
in enough income compared with your expenses, you are
going to stress yourself out over paying your bills every
month. To understand just what you can afford, you need to
first figure out your housing expenses, such as your monthly
mortgage payment, property taxes and so on. These combined
housing expenses should not be more than 28 percent of your
gross income. You then need to figure out all of your other
debts such as car loans, credit card debt and student loans.
Your total debt-to-income ratio should not exceed 36 percent.
So, if you have a heavy debt load in other areas, you might
have to adjust your mortgage down to compensate.
