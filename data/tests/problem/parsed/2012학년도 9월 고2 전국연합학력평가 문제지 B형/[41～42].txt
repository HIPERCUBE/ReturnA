Babies must crawl before they walk, parents and
pediatricians agree. But new research may change the way
we look at this idea. According to anthropologist David
Tracer, babies of the Au hunter-gatherers of Papua New
Guinea do not go through a crawling stage. Instead their
parents hold them in their arms until they can walk. Yet Au
children do not appear to suffer any ill effects from skipping
this phase. Tracer argued that, in fact, not crawling may be
entirely normal. In his observations of 113 Au mother-child
pairs, Tracer found that babies up to 12 months old were
held upright in a sling 86 percent of the time. On the rare
occasions when the mothers put their infants on the ground,
they held them up in a sitting position, rather than placing
them down on their stomachs. As a result of spending all of
that time upright, Au kids never learn to crawl. The Au are
not alone in discouraging their children from crawling.
Citing a study of Bangladeshi children showing that
crawling significantly increases the risk of contracting
diarrhea, Tracer proposes that infants limits their
exposure to ground germs. He therefore contends that the
crawling stage is a recent invention―one that emerged only
within the past century or two, after humans began living in
elevated houses with flooring, which would have been much
more hygienic than dirt. Tracer’s work once more highlights
how narrowly we view normal infant development.
