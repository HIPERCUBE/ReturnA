The sociobiologist E. O. Wilson, from his studies of ants,
showed how it was often an evolutionary advantage for a
single animal to die to protect its relatives, since they too
shared the same genes. ①Moreover, it was also sometimes
an advantage for an individual animal not to have offspring
directly, but instead to devote its life to taking care of
siblings or cousins, which again shared the same genes. ② In
this way, ultimately, that animal’s own genes would survive
and be passed on. ③ In ant societies, self-sacrificing
behavior could sometimes become an evolutionary advantage.
④Ants attack their enemies by biting, stinging, often
injecting or spraying chemicals, which helps to protect their
societies. ⑤Survival of the fittest didn’t necessarily mean the
biggest and strongest, but the one which was best able to
make sure that its genes were passed on.

It seems that new members to our reading club have
decided that it is a place where extreme political views can
be expressed openly. The original reason for setting up the
club was to encourage a social gathering where we could
discuss new and old books, and make suggestions as to the
meaning behind the words. It seems that, at recent meetings
though, people have spent more time discussing what is
happening in the political environment rather than what is
happening between the covers of the books. Political
discussions are all very well in the right place, but it is just
that the reading club is not the place where politics should
interfere with the purpose of the meeting. This issue should be
brought to everyone’s attention. Otherwise, I feel that the
reading group may no longer function as it should and once did.

27. Climate change might hit us in the most important place of
all― . Why do we care about climate change?
There are many environmental problems caused by climate
change, but they might not be as important as the impact
that it might have on the most vital function of any species:
feeding itself. Since the human population broke the 7 billion
mark late last year, feeding the growing population is the
greatest challenge to humanity. That’s why the threat that
climate change could mess with agriculture is so scary. In
last week’s Science, an international group of leading
investigators published an open letter urging policymakers to
ensure that agriculture becomes a more vital part of global
action against climate change. “Global agriculture must
produce more food to feed a growing population,” they write.
“Yet scientific assessments point to climate change as a
growing threat to agricultural yields and food security.”

28. You’ve just found the perfect house in the perfect neighborhood.
Of course you’re excited, but “ .”
No matter how much you want that house, if you don’t bring
in enough income compared with your expenses, you are
going to stress yourself out over paying your bills every
month. To understand just what you can afford, you need to
first figure out your housing expenses, such as your monthly
mortgage payment, property taxes and so on. These combined
housing expenses should not be more than 28 percent of your
gross income. You then need to figure out all of your other
debts such as car loans, credit card debt and student loans.
Your total debt-to-income ratio should not exceed 36 percent.
So, if you have a heavy debt load in other areas, you might
have to adjust your mortgage down to compensate.

29. . That’s the conclusion of a
new study in the Journal of Consumer Research. Authors
Joann Peck and Suzanne B. Shu cite a report that warned
holiday shoppers to be cautious of retailers who encourage
them to hold objects and imagine the objects as their own
when shopping. They find that merely touching an object
increases the feelings of ownership a person has for the
object. This, in turn, results in a person being willing to pay
more for most objects that they touch versus objects that
they cannot touch. The research may help explain the link
between touch and impulse purchasing. The authors explain,
“Encouraging touch in a retail store may increase the feelings
of perceived ownership and influence the amount a customer
is willing to pay for a product.” [3점]
① Keep your hands off the goods
② Check every detail of the products

30. Ask anyone on the street if earthworms are good for
ecosystems and you will undoubtedly receive a resounding
“YES!” When asked why, they may say something like
“earthworms mix and enrich the soil.” It is a basic ecological
concept that we may have learned as early as kindergarten.
However, recent research on invasion of these seemingly
benevolent creatures into previously earthworm-free hardwood
forests of the Great Lakes Region has seriously challenged
that belief. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have
documented dramatic changes in native hardwood forest
ecosystems when exotic earthworms invade. These changes
include losses of native understory plant species and tree
seedlings, changes in soil structure and declines in nutrient
availability. There is also fascinating evidence emerging that
the changes caused by exotic earthworms may lead to a
series of other changes in the forest that affect small mammal,
bird and amphibian populations. These results suggest that
exotic earthworms may . [3점]
① move backward as well as forward
② threaten the stability of the ecosystem
③ decompose into soil in hardwood forests
④ reach the peak of their activity in spring
⑤ make the soil more fertile than any other species
31. Every person has his or her own phobias or fears. Most fears
are harmless, but, if they actually stop you from having fun and
becoming successful, you should start learning how to stop
being scared. In this way, you can make yourself braver, and be
able to live a more relaxed life. Here is a tip. You can overcome
your phobias effectively if you .
For example, if you are frightened of roaches, it is a good
idea to start staring at pictures of roaches and watch movies
that show you some roaches. Next, you can try sweeping
dead roaches off your floor, and then eventually look at one
or two crawling cockroaches first before actually stepping on
them or killing them. This process is more effective for
‘objects and animal fears’ rather than fear of failure or being
afraid of rejection.

Even if you expect the ①majority of your readers to
understand your native language, you may be tempted to use
English when writing about research work. Usually
researchers all over the world know English and use it a lot,
and often the relevant terminology is more ②well-known in
English than in your own language. Thus, to ③maximize the
number of interested people that can understand your text,
you often select English even if a great number of your
readers have the same native language as you. Alternatively,
you might write your texts both in your native language and
in English, and this ④ reduces the work needed for writing
your document and possibly maintaining it. The maintenance
problem is especially important for documents on the Web―the
information system where one crucial feature is the ability to
keep things really ⑤ up-to-date. Consequently, the use of
English in essentially national environments tends to grow.

There’s a lot of evidence that strong communities have less
crime and survive disasters better. Here’s an example: the
environmentalist film maker Judith Helfand is making a film
about a massive heat wave in Chicago in 1995 that killed
about six hundred people. She explains that the victims had
one thing in common: they were socially isolated. They didn’t
have friends or family or trusted neighbors to notice that
they hadn’t been out of their house lately, or to check that
their air conditioners were working well. In fact,
three-quarters of Americans don’t know their neighbors.
Judith argues that the best way to prevent deaths from future
heat waves is not having a policy of handing out discount air
conditioner coupons, but providing community-building
activities that strengthen social ties throughout the year.

36. basking shark에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The basking shark is the second largest fish, surpassed
only by the whale shark. A grown-up basking shark usually
has a length between 8 and 10 meters and weighs about 4
tons. In spite of its size, basking sharks are not aggressive
and generally harmless to people. The basking shark has a
worldwide distribution and characteristically migrates with the
seasons. During the summer, they feed on plankton near the
surface in more coastal waters. In the winter months, rather
than spending time near the surface, basking sharks spend
more time in deeper water. So they are very rarely seen
during the winter. The basking shark reproduces slowly. It
becomes fertile at the age of four and a pregnancy lasts for
about two years, resulting in not more than six
“baby-sharks,” each measuring about 1.5 meters in length.

The environmental benefits of recycling are obvious. But
focusing on the wrong end of the issue can point our efforts
in the wrong direction. At a recycling conference, I learned
about the Recycle Bank, a program that weighs residents’
recycling bins and awards people points for heavier bins.
That means the neighbor who buys cases of single-serving
bottled water gets points over the one who installed a filter
and drinks tap water in reusable containers! Similar ridiculous
situations are happening any place where people are
measuring progress by an increase in recycling rather than a
decrease in waste. Programs like this give recycling a bad
name by encouraging more consumption and more waste.
They support the generation of disposable products.

If you’ve ever driven by a wind farm, you may have
noticed that the turbines most likely have three blades. Not
two, not four, but three. There are a few reasons behind that.
If you have too many blades on a wind turbine, each blade
as it moves through the air leaves a whirlpool behind it. If
these whirlpools interfere with one another, that can cause
problems with efficiency. However, if you have a turbine with
two blades, it can’t capture as much energy from the wind as
a three-blade turbine can. It also suffers from a dynamic
imbalance; the two blades may receive higher wind speeds at
the top than the bottom. This causes a vibration problem and
vibrations in wind turbines are undesirable. Therefore, we
come to the three-blade wind turbines, which solve all the
problems mentioned above.

For most of us, the pain of losing a dollar is far more
powerful than the pleasure of winning a dollar. Marketing and
advertising executives follow this principle. A study of
insurance policies, for instance, found that consumers switch
companies twice as often when their carrier raises rates, as
opposed to when the competition decreases its rate by the
same amount. In everyday life, people make poor choices
when they try to avoid loss. Many home owners looking to
sell their houses right now would rather keep them on the
market for an extra year than drop the price to $ 5,000 less
than they paid, even though keeping the home for an extra
year will surely cost them more than $ 5,000. The idea of a
loss was just too painful for them. In contrast, home owners
facing a gain on a house often sold too early and for too
little. The gain didn’t matter as much as long as there wasn’t
a loss.

Babies must crawl before they walk, parents and
pediatricians agree. But new research may change the way
we look at this idea. According to anthropologist David
Tracer, babies of the Au hunter-gatherers of Papua New
Guinea do not go through a crawling stage. Instead their
parents hold them in their arms until they can walk. Yet Au
children do not appear to suffer any ill effects from skipping
this phase. Tracer argued that, in fact, not crawling may be
entirely normal. In his observations of 113 Au mother-child
pairs, Tracer found that babies up to 12 months old were
held upright in a sling 86 percent of the time. On the rare
occasions when the mothers put their infants on the ground,
they held them up in a sitting position, rather than placing
them down on their stomachs. As a result of spending all of
that time upright, Au kids never learn to crawl. The Au are
not alone in discouraging their children from crawling.
Citing a study of Bangladeshi children showing that
crawling significantly increases the risk of contracting
diarrhea, Tracer proposes that infants limits their
exposure to ground germs. He therefore contends that the
crawling stage is a recent invention―one that emerged only
within the past century or two, after humans began living in
elevated houses with flooring, which would have been much
more hygienic than dirt. Tracer’s work once more highlights
how narrowly we view normal infant development.

Billy was strangled by the umbilical cord during birth,

limbs. “He’ll be a vegetable the rest of his life. Put him in an
institution,” doctors told his parents, Mike and Judy, when
Billy was nine months old. *umbilical cord 탯줄

He became obsessed with giving Billy that feeling as often
as (b) he could. Mike got into such good shape that he and
Billy were ready to try the 1983 Summer Marathon. At the
beginning of the race, they were at the back, far behind all the
other runners. But, as the race progressed, they soon caught
up to their competition. To everyone’s amazement, they started
to pass many of the runners and eventually finished in 200th
place. “We couldn’t believe it,” Mike said. “It was like a dream
come true for us.”
(C)
But they didn’t believe it. They noticed the way Billy’s
eyes followed them around the room. When Billy was 11 they
took (c) him to the engineering department at Tufts
University and asked if there was anything to help the boy
communicate. “No way. There’s nothing going on in his

responded with a laugh. It turns out a lot was going on in
(d) his brain. Equipped with a computer that allowed him to
control the cursor by touching a switch with the side of his
head, Billy was finally able to communicate.

Several years later, Billy’s high school classmate was
badly hurt in an accident. When the school organized a
charity run for her, (e) he typed out, “Dad, I want to do
that.” His father, wondering how he would manage to run 5
miles himself, agreed to push Billy in his wheelchair. They
finished next to last, but “the smile on Billy’s face was worth
a million bucks,” said Mike. That night, Billy told his dad,
“Dad, when we were running, I didn’t feel handicapped
anymore.” That sentence changed Mike’s life forever.
