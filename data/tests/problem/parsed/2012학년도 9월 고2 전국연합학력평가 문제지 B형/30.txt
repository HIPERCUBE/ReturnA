30. Ask anyone on the street if earthworms are good for
ecosystems and you will undoubtedly receive a resounding
“YES!” When asked why, they may say something like
“earthworms mix and enrich the soil.” It is a basic ecological
concept that we may have learned as early as kindergarten.
However, recent research on invasion of these seemingly
benevolent creatures into previously earthworm-free hardwood
forests of the Great Lakes Region has seriously challenged
that belief. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have
documented dramatic changes in native hardwood forest
ecosystems when exotic earthworms invade. These changes
include losses of native understory plant species and tree
seedlings, changes in soil structure and declines in nutrient
availability. There is also fascinating evidence emerging that
the changes caused by exotic earthworms may lead to a
series of other changes in the forest that affect small mammal,
bird and amphibian populations. These results suggest that
exotic earthworms may . [3점]
① move backward as well as forward
② threaten the stability of the ecosystem
③ decompose into soil in hardwood forests
④ reach the peak of their activity in spring
⑤ make the soil more fertile than any other species
