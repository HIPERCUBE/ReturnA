29. . That’s the conclusion of a
new study in the Journal of Consumer Research. Authors
Joann Peck and Suzanne B. Shu cite a report that warned
holiday shoppers to be cautious of retailers who encourage
them to hold objects and imagine the objects as their own
when shopping. They find that merely touching an object
increases the feelings of ownership a person has for the
object. This, in turn, results in a person being willing to pay
more for most objects that they touch versus objects that
they cannot touch. The research may help explain the link
between touch and impulse purchasing. The authors explain,
“Encouraging touch in a retail store may increase the feelings
of perceived ownership and influence the amount a customer
is willing to pay for a product.” [3점]
