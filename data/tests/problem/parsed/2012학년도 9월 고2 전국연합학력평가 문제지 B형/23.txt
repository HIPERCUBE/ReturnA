Maybe you inherited some bonds from a beloved
grandmother, or your best friend tipped you off to a certain
mutual fund. Maybe your new job offer includes “attractive
stock options” and you’re wondering just how attractive they
are. But when you open the financial section of the newspaper,
it looks about as familiar as an alien language from another
planet. What do these words―bear market, bull market and
Dow Jones―mean? Here is a special lecture for beginners
that breaks the codes and provides quite a few examples that
can be seen in the influential daily economic newspapers.
The lecture explains the difficult economic vocabulary plainly.
Once you take this online course 30 minutes per day for one
week, reading the financial pages will be much easier.
