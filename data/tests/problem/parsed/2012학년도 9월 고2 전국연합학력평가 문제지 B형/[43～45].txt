(A)
Billy was strangled by the umbilical cord during birth,
leaving (a) him brain-damaged and unable to control his
limbs. “He’ll be a vegetable the rest of his life. Put him in an
institution,” doctors told his parents, Mike and Judy, when
Billy was nine months old. *umbilical cord 탯줄
(B)
He became obsessed with giving Billy that feeling as often
as (b) he could. Mike got into such good shape that he and
Billy were ready to try the 1983 Summer Marathon. At the
beginning of the race, they were at the back, far behind all the
other runners. But, as the race progressed, they soon caught
up to their competition. To everyone’s amazement, they started
to pass many of the runners and eventually finished in 200th
place. “We couldn’t believe it,” Mike said. “It was like a dream
come true for us.”
(C)
But they didn’t believe it. They noticed the way Billy’s
eyes followed them around the room. When Billy was 11 they
took (c) him to the engineering department at Tufts
University and asked if there was anything to help the boy
communicate. “No way. There’s nothing going on in his
brain,” Mike was told. “Watch this!” Mike told a joke. Billy
responded with a laugh. It turns out a lot was going on in
(d) his brain. Equipped with a computer that allowed him to
control the cursor by touching a switch with the side of his
head, Billy was finally able to communicate.
(D)
Several years later, Billy’s high school classmate was
badly hurt in an accident. When the school organized a
charity run for her, (e) he typed out, “Dad, I want to do
that.” His father, wondering how he would manage to run 5
miles himself, agreed to push Billy in his wheelchair. They
finished next to last, but “the smile on Billy’s face was worth
a million bucks,” said Mike. That night, Billy told his dad,
“Dad, when we were running, I didn’t feel handicapped
anymore.” That sentence changed Mike’s life forever.
