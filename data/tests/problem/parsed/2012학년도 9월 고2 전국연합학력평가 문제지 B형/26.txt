It seems that new members to our reading club have
decided that it is a place where extreme political views can
be expressed openly. The original reason for setting up the
club was to encourage a social gathering where we could
discuss new and old books, and make suggestions as to the
meaning behind the words. It seems that, at recent meetings
though, people have spent more time discussing what is
happening in the political environment rather than what is
happening between the covers of the books. Political
discussions are all very well in the right place, but it is just
that the reading club is not the place where politics should
interfere with the purpose of the meeting. This issue should be
brought to everyone’s attention. Otherwise, I feel that the
reading group may no longer function as it should and once did.
