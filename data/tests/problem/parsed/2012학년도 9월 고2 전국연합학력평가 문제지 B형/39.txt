But there’s a difference between being well-read and
knowing how to read well.
Critical reading is a way of reading that will allow you to
take a deeper look at literature. (① ) It’s an acquired skill
that you will develop with some knowledge and experience.
(② ) You may hear certain people referred to as being
well-read, which implies that they have read many different
books and other forms of literature. (③ ) In other words,
it’s not quantity but quality that counts. (④ ) To read
critically means to read analytically, which means to
question and to think about the written material in front of
you. (⑤ ) When you question something, it usually leads to
finding answers, and these answers will give you insight into
the author’s intentions.
