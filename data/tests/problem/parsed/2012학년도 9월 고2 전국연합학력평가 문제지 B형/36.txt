36. basking shark에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The basking shark is the second largest fish, surpassed
only by the whale shark. A grown-up basking shark usually
has a length between 8 and 10 meters and weighs about 4
tons. In spite of its size, basking sharks are not aggressive
and generally harmless to people. The basking shark has a
worldwide distribution and characteristically migrates with the
seasons. During the summer, they feed on plankton near the
surface in more coastal waters. In the winter months, rather
than spending time near the surface, basking sharks spend
more time in deeper water. So they are very rarely seen
during the winter. The basking shark reproduces slowly. It
becomes fertile at the age of four and a pregnancy lasts for
about two years, resulting in not more than six
“baby-sharks,” each measuring about 1.5 meters in length.
