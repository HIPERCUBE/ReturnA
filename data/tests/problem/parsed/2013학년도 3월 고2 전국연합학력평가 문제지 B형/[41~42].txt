One of the greatest annoyances in today’s gadget­filled 
world is that we continuously manage to misplace them. 
Finding a misplaced remote control, smartphone or even our 
car keys is not only an annoyance, but also a time 
consuming endeavor, right? A brilliant new invention called 
Stick­N­Find will change the way forgetful people live their 
lives.
Stick­N­Finds are about the size of a US quarter, with 
each one containing a circuit board, replaceable battery, 
buzzer and LED light. The tags can be stuck to items that 
are frequently lost, such as car keys or the TV remote, 
and a custom app allows the tags to be assigned to 
specific objects. When the object is lost, accessing the 
app on the smartphone will display how far away the 
object is (up to 100 feet). Then the users can find the 
missing item by moving in different directions to identify 
its               . The tag will also sound a buzzer or 
illuminate its LED lights, aiding in the search. For luggage, 
pets, and maybe your kids if you want to make sure they 
don’t wander off too far from home, this thing is absolutely 
perfect.
