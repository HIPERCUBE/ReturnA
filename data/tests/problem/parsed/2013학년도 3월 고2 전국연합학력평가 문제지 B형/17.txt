Mike Michalowicz, the author of The Pumpkin Plan, argues 
that comedians are the ultimate public speakers. For 
example, comedians have to hold an audience’s attention for 
an hour or more, they don’t get a break during their 
presentation, and they can’t rely on the audience for a Q&A. 
They are also expected to make the audience laugh 
constantly. And they don’t even get to use presentation 
software programs, because they want the audience looking 
at them, not trying to read a screen. These facts don’t mean 
you need to be a comedian on stage to perform well. You 
aren’t even required to tell jokes. To enhance your own 
presentations, however, start to observe the techniques 
comedians use, and employ them in your own speech.

Ironically, it’s usually when we try to do everything right 
that we wind up doing something wrong. That’s because the 
more balls you try to juggle, the more likely you are to drop 
one. You hope many extracurricular activities will get you 
into your first choice college, so you spend hours working 
out with the football club, run for student government, and 
volunteer for hours on free afternoons. Meanwhile, you make 
time to try to keep your grades up. With that kind of 
pressure, you can misread an assignment, double book your 
schedule, or otherwise let people down ― but it’s not your 
parents’ fault or your friends’. They aren’t expecting too 
much of you by asking for one spot in your hectic schedule. 
It’s up to you to recognize your limits, not sign up for too 
many extracurricular activities, and admit when you’ve 
dropped the ball.

Surfing is often thought of as a male sport, but in fact 
women have been surfing in California since the early 1920s 
and today there are women surfers in every surfing country 
in the world. Like men, they range from amateurs to 
professionals. Though women may not have been taken 
seriously in surf contests, these days they compete because 
they have truly earned that right. One of the earliest women 
surfers was Mary Hawkins, who showed very graceful form 
in the surf. She was the first in a long line which stretched 
down in the 1960s, to Marge Calhoun and her daughters, and 
Linda Benson, followed by some of the top professional 
surfers today.

② Surfing: Only for Men?

Octavius went to Albania to complete his academic and 
military training. While there, ① he learned of the 
assassination of Julius Caesar. Octavius returned to Rome 
and found that Caesar’s will would make him Caesar’s 
adopted son and heir to ② his political and personal fortune. 
He was advised not to accept Caesar’s request because ③ he 
was only 18 and unprepared to deal with the hazards of 
Roman power politics. Nevertheless, ④ he did accept. 
Caesar’s will called for games for the entertainment of the 
public. Such things required funds. Octavius borrowed funds 
and ⑤ his efforts to comply with Caesar’s will got 
considerable support among the troops of Caesar and the 
public.

How you address your professors depends on many 
factors such as age, college culture, and their own 
preference. Some teachers will ask you ① to call them by 
their first names, especially if they’re relatively young. 
They enjoy the informal atmosphere ② generated by having 
everyone in the class on the same level. Some colleges, in 
fact, pride themselves on having all their faculty and 
students on a first­name basis. But beware : one of the 
surest ways to upset professors ③ is to call them by their 
first names against their wishes. Most professors see 
themselves in a position of professional authority over their 
students ④ whom they earned by many years of study. 
They no more want to be called John or Maria than ⑤ does 
your average physician.

Teeth are covered in enamel, the hardest substance found 
in the body. It is, however, ① weak against acids. Acids 
from food can attack the enamel. These are found not only 
in sweet foods like ice cream and candy, but also in 
healthy vegetable and fruit juices. Particularly dangerous, 
however, are ② sticky foods that cling to the teeth. 
These ③ encourage the formation of plaque, which is a 
mixture of the remains of food and bacteria. These 
bacteria turn simple carbohydrates, such as those in 
sugar, white flour, or potatoes, into acid that ④ damages 
the tooth enamel. The more frequently these bacteria get 
new resources, the ⑤ less acid they produce. In other 
words, it is more harmful to your teeth to repeatedly drink 
lemonade than it is to eat several chocolate bars at one

The graph above shows changes in the numbers of   
tourists to Bali, Indonesia from four countries ― China, 
Japan, Korea, and India ― from 2002 to 2011. ① The number 
of Japanese tourists was at its peak in 2008, and decreased 
sharply from 2008 to 2011. ② On the other hand, the 
number of Chinese tourists drastically increased between 
2006 and 2011. ③ The number of the Indian tourists 
continuously increased from 2006 to 2011. ④ In 2008, there 
were less than twice as many tourists from Japan as there 
were from Korea. ⑤ From 2002 to 2008, the number of 
Korean tourists was on the rise, but the number has 
remained almost unchanged since 2008.
30. phyllium giganteum에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
Phyllium giganteum, which is called the “walking leaf,” 
disguises itself so that enemies often aren’t able to 
distinguish this insect from real leaves. It can get up to 5 
inches long and 3 inches wide. The males have rear wings 
extending to the end of the abdomen. The females don’t 
have rear wings, and their front wings are narrower and 
shorter than the abdomen. They lay between 100 and 300 
eggs which have very thick shells. They eat plants like oak, 
eucalyptus, raspberry, and rose. They live mainly in tropical 
areas of Asia. Since they have a very limited mobility, they 
only move the necessary distances to eat, remaining stable 
in very small areas and passing their lives almost motionless 
most of the time.

① 자신을 나뭇잎처럼 보이게 하여 적들을 속인다.

31. It’s not a real vacation if you’re reading email or calling 
in for messages. When Jai and I went on our honeymoon, 
we wanted to be left alone. My boss, however, felt I needed 
to provide a way for people to contact me. So, I came up 
with the perfect phone message: “Hi, this is Randy. My wife 
and I are going away for a month. I hope you don’t have a 
problem with that, but my boss does.” I then gave the 
names of Jai’s parents and their address. “If you look them 
up in the phone book, you can get their number. And then, 
if you can convince my new in­laws that your emergency 
merits interrupting their only daughter’s honeymoon, they 
have our number.” We didn’t get any                .
① gifts ② calls ③ relatives

32. Walter Debner ran an old­style grocery store in 
Minnesota, and he was looking for a way to give his 
business a boost. He once remarked that people who came 
into the shop without a bag took a lot less food than those 
who came with their bags. Why? Because they simply 
couldn’t carry the groceries. So he set about devising a way 
to help them purchase more at one time. It took him four 
years to develop the right solution: a package which was 
inexpensive, easy to use, and strong enough to hold a lot of 
groceries. The package consisted of a paper bag with cord 
running through it for strength and increased customers’  
. He patented his product and sold 
over a million shopping bags a year.
① profit margins ② financial benefit
③ carrying capacity ④ physical strength
⑤ constant complaints
33. Educating consumers is important because people can 
have great power over how goods are made and sold, 
depending on what they choose to buy. This power is 
sometimes shown through campaigns and boycotts, when 
people refuse to buy certain food products. For instance, 
thousands of dolphins used to be killed in tuna fishing nets, 
but                           helped to change this practice. 
Tuna that was caught without harming dolphins was labeled 
“dolphin friendly” so consumers wouldn’t buy other tuna 
products. This forced many companies to change their 
method of fishing. As a result, dolphin deaths decreased by 
over 80 percent between 1990 and 2000.
① food shortages ② ocean temperature
③ animal instincts ④ consumer pressure
⑤ modern technology
34. When I was a child, I loved to go for car rides with my 
father. During such rides, I was always full of questions: 
What does this button do? Can I press this one? I vividly 
remember turning on the light inside the car, making our 
vehicle a motorized firefly, and flying down the night’s path. 
In one such instance, my father told me, “Don’t turn on the 
light! It makes the car a fishbowl; everyone can see inside.” 
It seems as though the average person has these same 
reservations about being revealed or exposed ― emotionally, 
physically, or both. Most people have a certain wish to      
, which perhaps explains my father’s 
resistance to having the car’s inside light on while driving at 
n ight. [3점]

New research from Brigham Young University shows that 
dads are in a unique position to help their children develop 
persistence. According to the study, when children felt 
warmth and love from their father, were told the reasons 
behind rules, and were granted an appropriate level of 
autonomy, they were able to set a foundation to flourish and 
cope with the stress and pressures of life. Over time, kids 
with fathers involved in their lives were more likely to 
become persistent, which led to higher engagement in school 
and lower rates of delinquency. After following 325 families 
over several years, two professors, Laura Walker and Randal 
Day, concluded that dads play a big role in helping their kids 
set goals and complete them. [3점]

① ought to thank their fathers
② should learn from their mistakes
③ don’t get along with their fathers
④ can’t persist with their own viewpoint
⑤ are likely to be involved in wrongdoings
36. Originally, a Dutch auction referred to a type of auction 
that starts with a high price that keeps going down until the 
item sells. This is the opposite process from regular 
auctions, where an item starts at a minimum price and 
bidders wrestle over it by increasing their offers. In a Dutch 
auction, however, the auctioneer offers the item at a certain 
price and waits for somebody to agree. If nobody does, then 
he                               . This continues until a 
participant says “yes” and thus wins the item. There are no 
battles over items in a Dutch auction; the first person to 
accept the offered price wins the item, resulting in saving a 
lot of time.
* bidder: 입찰자
① donates the item to charity
② suggests a temporary recess
③ lowers the price and asks again
④ shows another item to participants
⑤ extends the deadline to the next day

A paradigm is the way you see something, your point of 
view, or belief. Our paradigms are often way off the mark, 
and they create limitations. Paradigms are like glasses. When 
you have incomplete paradigms about yourself or life in 
general, it’s like wearing glasses with the wrong 
prescription. That lens affects how you see everything else.

brought the jewels to him. The deed had been overseen by 
another man. He had pursued the thief and had struggled

Instead of putting more armed police in the street, they 
chose to play classical music.
A fascinating experiment once took place in a small 
Australian village. ( ① ) For the past two years, the village 
had witnessed that the number of street crimes was rapidly 
increasing. ( ② ) Local residents, alarmed by the increase 
in street crime, got together and decided that the best way 
to confront the problem was to remove the offenders from 
the main street after nightfall. ( ③ ) Every single block 
began piping out the sounds of Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and 
Brahms. ( ④ ) In less than a week, the town reported a 
dramatic decrease in crime. ( ⑤ ) The experiment was so 
successful that the main train station in Copenhagen, 
Denmark adopted the same approach ― with similar results, 
too.

Order effect is the prejudicial impact that the  
presentation order of a question, idea, answer, or product 
has on a respondent. Whether the item is located in the 
first, last, or middle position sometimes affects the 
selection of or response to that item. There have been 
several studies that have noticed an order effect when an 
early stimulus acts as a frame of reference for later 
stimuli. Robert Ferber from Illinois University had 
respondents rate a list of occupations and found that the 
maximum or minimum ratings occurred on the one 
presented first, regardless of the ordering of the 
occupations. In another study, the subjects were asked to 
rate a beverage on intention to buy on a scale ranging from 
“definitely would not buy” to “definitely would buy.” The 
first beverage tasted was rated significantly higher.
