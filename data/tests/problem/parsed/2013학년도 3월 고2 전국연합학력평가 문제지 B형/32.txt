32. Walter Debner ran an old­style grocery store in 
Minnesota, and he was looking for a way to give his 
business a boost. He once remarked that people who came 
into the shop without a bag took a lot less food than those 
who came with their bags. Why? Because they simply 
couldn’t carry the groceries. So he set about devising a way 
to help them purchase more at one time. It took him four 
years to develop the right solution: a package which was 
inexpensive, easy to use, and strong enough to hold a lot of 
groceries. The package consisted of a paper bag with cord 
running through it for strength and increased customers’  
. He patented his product and sold 
over a million shopping bags a year.
