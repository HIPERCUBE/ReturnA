Ironically, it’s usually when we try to do everything right 
that we wind up doing something wrong. That’s because the 
more balls you try to juggle, the more likely you are to drop 
one. You hope many extracurricular activities will get you 
into your first choice college, so you spend hours working 
out with the football club, run for student government, and 
volunteer for hours on free afternoons. Meanwhile, you make 
time to try to keep your grades up. With that kind of 
pressure, you can misread an assignment, double book your 
schedule, or otherwise let people down ― but it’s not your 
parents’ fault or your friends’. They aren’t expecting too 
much of you by asking for one spot in your hectic schedule. 
It’s up to you to recognize your limits, not sign up for too 
many extracurricular activities, and admit when you’ve 
dropped the ball.
