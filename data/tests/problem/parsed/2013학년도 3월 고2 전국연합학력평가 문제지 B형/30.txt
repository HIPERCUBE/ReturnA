30. phyllium giganteum에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
Phyllium giganteum, which is called the “walking leaf,” 
disguises itself so that enemies often aren’t able to 
distinguish this insect from real leaves. It can get up to 5 
inches long and 3 inches wide. The males have rear wings 
extending to the end of the abdomen. The females don’t 
have rear wings, and their front wings are narrower and 
shorter than the abdomen. They lay between 100 and 300 
eggs which have very thick shells. They eat plants like oak, 
eucalyptus, raspberry, and rose. They live mainly in tropical 
areas of Asia. Since they have a very limited mobility, they 
only move the necessary distances to eat, remaining stable 
in very small areas and passing their lives almost motionless 
most of the time.
