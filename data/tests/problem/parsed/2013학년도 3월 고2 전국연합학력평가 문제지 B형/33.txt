33. Educating consumers is important because people can 
have great power over how goods are made and sold, 
depending on what they choose to buy. This power is 
sometimes shown through campaigns and boycotts, when 
people refuse to buy certain food products. For instance, 
thousands of dolphins used to be killed in tuna fishing nets, 
but                           helped to change this practice. 
Tuna that was caught without harming dolphins was labeled 
“dolphin friendly” so consumers wouldn’t buy other tuna 
products. This forced many companies to change their 
method of fishing. As a result, dolphin deaths decreased by 
over 80 percent between 1990 and 2000.
