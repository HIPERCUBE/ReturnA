27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
How you address your professors depends on many 
factors such as age, college culture, and their own 
preference. Some teachers will ask you ① to call them by 
their first names, especially if they’re relatively young. 
They enjoy the informal atmosphere ② generated by having 
everyone in the class on the same level. Some colleges, in 
fact, pride themselves on having all their faculty and 
students on a first­name basis. But beware : one of the 
surest ways to upset professors ③ is to call them by their 
first names against their wishes. Most professors see 
themselves in a position of professional authority over their 
students ④ whom they earned by many years of study. 
They no more want to be called John or Maria than ⑤ does 
your average physician.
