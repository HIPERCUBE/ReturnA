36. Originally, a Dutch auction referred to a type of auction 
that starts with a high price that keeps going down until the 
item sells. This is the opposite process from regular 
auctions, where an item starts at a minimum price and 
bidders wrestle over it by increasing their offers. In a Dutch 
auction, however, the auctioneer offers the item at a certain 
price and waits for somebody to agree. If nobody does, then 
he                               . This continues until a 
participant says “yes” and thus wins the item. There are no 
battles over items in a Dutch auction; the first person to 
accept the offered price wins the item, resulting in saving a 
lot of time.
