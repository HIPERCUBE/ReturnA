Order effect is the prejudicial impact that the  
presentation order of a question, idea, answer, or product 
has on a respondent. Whether the item is located in the 
first, last, or middle position sometimes affects the 
selection of or response to that item. There have been 
several studies that have noticed an order effect when an 
early stimulus acts as a frame of reference for later 
stimuli. Robert Ferber from Illinois University had 
respondents rate a list of occupations and found that the 
maximum or minimum ratings occurred on the one 
presented first, regardless of the ordering of the 
occupations. In another study, the subjects were asked to 
rate a beverage on intention to buy on a scale ranging from 
“definitely would not buy” to “definitely would buy.” The 
first beverage tasted was rated significantly higher.
