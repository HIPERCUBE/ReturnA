(A)
I was nine years old. I was at the local library. The 
librarian behind the desk looked over her glasses. (a) She 
studied me. My shirt was untucked and one shoe was 
untied. I chose 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules 
Verne. I liked the drawings on the cover and the idea of 
people living under the ocean.
(B)
“Where’s the book?” my mother said. “I beg your pardon?” 
“Where’s the book?” The woman reached behind her. (b) She 
plopped it on the counter. My mother grabbed the book and 
pushed it in my arms. “Don’t ever tell a child something’s 
too hard,” she said firmly. “And NEVER this child.” I was 
being pulled out the door, hanging tightly to Jules Verne. I 
felt like we had just robbed a bank, and I wondered if we 
were going to get in trouble.
* plop: 쿵 하고 놓다
(C)
I hadn’t looked at how difficult the book was. “This is too 
hard for you,” she said as she put it on a shelf behind her. I 
felt like it had been locked in a safe. I went back to the 
children’s section. And I chose a picture book about a 
monkey and returned to the desk. (c) She stamped that one 
without comment. When my mother drove up, I hurried into 
her car. She saw the book I had chosen. She asked, “Haven’t 
you read this one already?” “The librarian lady wouldn’t let 
me take the one I wanted.” She turned off the ignition. “Why 
wouldn’t she let you take it?” “(d) She said it was too hard.”
(D)
My mother pulled me from the car. (e) She marched me 
to the desk. “I’m Mrs. Benetto. This is my son, Charley. 
Did you tell him a book was too hard for him to read?” 
The librarian stiffened. She was much older than my 
mother, and I was surprised at my mother’s tone, given 
how she usually talked to old people. “He wanted to check 
out 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,” she said. “He’s too 
young. Look at him.” I lowered my head.
