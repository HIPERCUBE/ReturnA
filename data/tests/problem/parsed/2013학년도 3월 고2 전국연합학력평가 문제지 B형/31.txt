31. It’s not a real vacation if you’re reading email or calling 
in for messages. When Jai and I went on our honeymoon, 
we wanted to be left alone. My boss, however, felt I needed 
to provide a way for people to contact me. So, I came up 
with the perfect phone message: “Hi, this is Randy. My wife 
and I are going away for a month. I hope you don’t have a 
problem with that, but my boss does.” I then gave the 
names of Jai’s parents and their address. “If you look them 
up in the phone book, you can get their number. And then, 
if you can convince my new in­laws that your emergency 
merits interrupting their only daughter’s honeymoon, they 
have our number.” We didn’t get any                .
