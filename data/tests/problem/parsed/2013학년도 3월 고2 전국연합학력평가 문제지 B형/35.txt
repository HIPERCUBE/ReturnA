New research from Brigham Young University shows that 
dads are in a unique position to help their children develop 
persistence. According to the study, when children felt 
warmth and love from their father, were told the reasons 
behind rules, and were granted an appropriate level of 
autonomy, they were able to set a foundation to flourish and 
cope with the stress and pressures of life. Over time, kids 
with fathers involved in their lives were more likely to 
become persistent, which led to higher engagement in school 
and lower rates of delinquency. After following 325 families 
over several years, two professors, Laura Walker and Randal 
Day, concluded that dads play a big role in helping their kids 
set goals and complete them. [3점]
