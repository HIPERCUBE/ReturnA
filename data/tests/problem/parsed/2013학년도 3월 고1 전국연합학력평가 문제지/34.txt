34. The desire to have a fulfilling job ― a career that provides 
a deep sense of purpose, and reflects our values, passions 
and personality ― is a(n)                        . The word 
‘fulfillment’ does not even appear in the famous dictionary, A 
Dictionary of the English Language, published in 1755. For 
centuries, most people of the Western world were busy 
struggling to meet their basic needs. They could not care 
about whether they had an exciting career that used their 
talents and improved their well­being. Any idea of fulfillment 
didn’t exist in their minds. But today, the spread of material 
richness has freed our minds to pursue fulfillment from our 
work. [3점]
