While you are at work, you may dream about a month of 
Sundays, but your boss wishes for a week of Tuesdays. 
What makes Tuesday special? Monday is overloaded with 
meetings to “get things moving,” which aren’t very 
productive. Wednesday is “hump day” ― just get over it, a 
worker thinks. On Thursday, people become exhausted; and 
on Friday, everybody is thinking about the weekend. On 
Tuesdays, employees hit peak performance because they are 
very focused on day­to­day activities. Also, Tuesday is 
usually the first day of the week that they’re focused on 
their own task. In 10 hours, they’re doing 20 hours worth of 
work.
* hump: 고비, 난관
