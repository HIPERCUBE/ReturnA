36. When you write e­mail messages to people you don’t know well 
or to people of higher position, there are a few things that you 
need to remember. One of them is                              . 
We would suggest that you don’t burden your readers with 
messages that are too long or include unnecessary information. If, 
for example, you need to cancel an appointment or miss class 
because you are ill, there is no need to describe the illness. A 
simple statement that you are ill and unable to get to class or to 
an appointment is fine.
① to use common expressions
② to express requests politely
③ to keep your messages brief
④ to start with casual greetings
