Winston Churchill, a former British prime minister, was 
an amateur artist, and Henry Luce, an American 
publisher, kept one of Churchill’s landscape paintings 
hanging in his office in New York.
(A) A few days later, however, the painting was shipped 
back, but slightly changed: a single sheep now grazed 
peacefully in the picture.
(B) The next day, to Luce’s horror, Churchill’s secretary 
called and asked him to send the painting to England. 
Luce did so, worried that he had perhaps upset the 
prime minister.
(C) On a tour through the United States, Churchill visited 
Luce in his office and the two men looked at the 
painting together. Luce said, “It’s a good picture, but I 
think it needs something more in the grassland ― a 
sheep, perhaps.”
