32. One late evening in August of 1952, in a theater in 
New York, a man just opened and closed a piano cover 
three times before an audience, not hitting any keys 
for four minutes and thirty­three seconds.  It was John 
Cage’s 4′33″, the famous musical composition that consists 
of             . Cage believed the audience could feel music 
fully without the artist. Therefore, the only way to prove 
his belief was to remove the artist from the process of 
creation. In 4′33″, neither artist nor composer had any 
impact on the piece, so that Cage had no way of controlling 
what sounds would be heard by the audience.
