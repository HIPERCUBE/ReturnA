31. People think identical twins are exactly alike in every 
way: they look alike, they dress in matching clothes, and 
they share the same likes and dislikes. Parents of identical 
twins, however, know differently. In fact, identical twins 
are              individuals. For example, my own children 
have always shown about a twenty­five percent difference 
in their weight. Also, they don’t act alike either. One likes 
to dance; the other likes to play basketball. Certainly, we 
encourage them to pursue their individual interests, but 
they decide to do these activities all on their own.
