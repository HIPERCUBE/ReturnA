But, as the earth’s surface is curved, there is a path 
that looks curved and hence longer on a flat map, but 
which is actually shorter.
Imagine that you wanted to travel from New York to 
Madrid, two cities that are at almost the same latitude. ( ① ) 
If the earth were flat, the shortest route would be to head 
straight east. ( ② ) If you did that, you would arrive in 
Madrid after travelling 3,707 miles. ( ③ ) You can get there 
in 3,605 miles if you follow the great­circle route, which is 
to first head northeast, then gradually turn east, and then 
southeast. ( ④ ) The difference in distance between the 
two routes is due to the earth’s curved surface. ( ⑤ ) 
Airlines know this, and arrange for their pilots to follow 
great­circle routes.
