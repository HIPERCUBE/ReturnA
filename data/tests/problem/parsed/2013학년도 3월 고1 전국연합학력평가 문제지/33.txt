33. A tornado touched down in Hammond on June 20, 2002, 
with tragic results. Towering Pines, the wilderness preserve 
owned and maintained by the town, was largely destroyed. 
The tornado was, according to all weather experts in the 
area, a very rare case in New England. Captain Maria 
Hinojosa of the New England Weather Bureau says, “The 
Hammond tornado was like a snowstorm in South Africa, or 
a drought in the rain forest. It wasn’t impossible. But it is 
one of those things that reminds you that weather is         
.” [3점]
