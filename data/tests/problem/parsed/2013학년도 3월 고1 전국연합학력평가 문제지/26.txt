An Indian man goes into a curry house in Singapore and 
orders three dinners. ① He eats all three meals by himself. 
“Are you hungry?” asks the owner. “I am one of three 
brothers,” ② he replies. “One brother lives in Delhi and the 
other in Beijing. So we always eat like this to remember 
each other.” Every time the Indian comes to the restaurant, 
③ he eats three dinners. After a year of this, he comes into 
the restaurant looking sad. Weeping, ④ he orders only two 
dinners. The owner approaches with his head bowed. ⑤ He 
expresses his sorrow for the death of the Indian’s brother. 
The Indian says: “Oh, neither of my brothers is dead. My 
doctor advised me to go on a diet.”
