We’ve all met people who limit their lives in the 
narrowest possible terms. They are determined to stay in a 
limited comfort zone. Some people avoid the opportunity to 
make a public presentation because it makes them nervous. 
Others reject a chance to study abroad because they don’t 
consider themselves adventurous. People become trapped by 
their own conception of their limits, so they become angry 
at even being asked to step beyond them. This attitude 
toward life, however, is a huge mistake. Welcome new 
challenges at every turn, saying yes as often as possible.
