What do you get from the air around you? You can’t see 
it, but you take it in every breath. It’s a gas called oxygen. 
All animals need oxygen. Animals that live in water get 
their oxygen from the water. Plants also need gases from 
the air. They need carbon dioxide to make food during the 
day and oxygen to use food at night.
Where do these gases come from? They come from 
plants and animals! Plants make oxygen, a gas that 
animals need. Animals give off carbon dioxide, a gas that 
plants need. Animals and plants take part in the carbon 
dioxide and oxygen cycles. The carbon dioxide and oxygen 
cycles are the              of these two gases. The gases 
move from one population to another in both water and 
land ecosystems. If gases were used up instead of being 
exchanged, living things would die.
