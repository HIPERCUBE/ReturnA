23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
We’ve all met people who limit their lives in the 
narrowest possible terms. They are determined to stay in a 
limited comfort zone. Some people avoid the opportunity to 
make a public presentation because it makes them nervous. 
Others reject a chance to study abroad because they don’t 
consider themselves adventurous. People become trapped by 
their own conception of their limits, so they become angry 
at even being asked to step beyond them. This attitude 
toward life, however, is a huge mistake. Welcome new 
challenges at every turn, saying yes as often as possible.
① 새로운 기회를 받아들여라.
② 편안한 학습 환경을 만들어라.
③ 발표를 위한 준비를 철저히 해라.
④ 자신의 적성에 맞는 일을 찾아라.
⑤ 다른 사람의 평가를 겸허히 수용해라.
24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
Think about times in your life when you have been singled 
out by somebody who made you feel special. Maybe this 
person praised you, gave you an unexpected gift, or took the 
time to write you a letter. How did you feel toward this 
person? You may use any of a whole range of positive 
adjectives to thank him or her. Probably others want to feel 
the same way you feel. People want to feel special; it’s a 
normal human desire, and I have never met a person who 
doesn’t appreciate this kind of attention.
① 긍정적인 말은 성공을 위한 기본 요소이다.
② 행동에 대해 구체적으로 칭찬하는 것이 중요하다.
③ 특별한 대우를 받고자 하는 것은 인간의 욕구이다.

⑤ 상대방의 입장에서 보면 객관적으로 상황을 이해할 수 있다.
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
While you are at work, you may dream about a month of 
Sundays, but your boss wishes for a week of Tuesdays. 
What makes Tuesday special? Monday is overloaded with 
meetings to “get things moving,” which aren’t very 
productive. Wednesday is “hump day” ― just get over it, a 
worker thinks. On Thursday, people become exhausted; and 
on Friday, everybody is thinking about the weekend. On 
Tuesdays, employees hit peak performance because they are 
very focused on day­to­day activities. Also, Tuesday is 
usually the first day of the week that they’re focused on 
their own task. In 10 hours, they’re doing 20 hours worth of 
work.
* hump: 고비, 난관
① Do You Want to Be More Creative?
② What Your Workers Are Waiting for
③ Weekends Make You More Productive
④ How to Make Your Own Weekly Schedule
⑤ Why Is Tuesday the Most Productive Day?
26. 밑줄 친 He[he]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
An Indian man goes into a curry house in Singapore and 
orders three dinners. ① He eats all three meals by himself. 
“Are you hungry?” asks the owner. “I am one of three 
brothers,” ② he replies. “One brother lives in Delhi and the 
other in Beijing. So we always eat like this to remember 
each other.” Every time the Indian comes to the restaurant, 
③ he eats three dinners. After a year of this, he comes into 
the restaurant looking sad. Weeping, ④ he orders only two 
dinners. The owner approaches with his head bowed. ⑤ He 
expresses his sorrow for the death of the Indian’s brother. 
The Indian says: “Oh, neither of my brothers is dead. My 
doctor advised me to go on a diet.”
27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
There is no one right way to draw. Don’t you believe me? 
Collect 100 amazing artists in a room and have them ① draw 
the same chair. What do you get? One hundred very 
different chair drawings. ② Keeping this in mind, you’ll have 
a lot more fun drawing the unique art that comes from you. 
You’re the only artist in the world ③ which can draw the 
way you do. Exploring your personal drawing styles ④ is 
important. Notice how you have grown or improved as you 
practice. Pay attention to ⑤ what you like most about your 
drawings.
28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 
않은 것은?
Unfortunately, many insects don’t live through the cold 
winter. Others, however, have come up with clever plans to 
① survive until spring. For example, some flies stay in 
corners of a warm house over the winter, so it’s ② unlikely 
to see them flying outside. Certain honeybees pack together 
in a small space and move their wings quickly to produce
heat, so that they can keep ③ warm. Some mosquitoes, like 
frogs, sleep through the winter cold. This is because they 
cannot move around when the temperature goes ④ up. In 
spring, the females slowly become ⑤ active, flying around 
looking for food ― fresh blood.
29. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 문장은?

of rubber in both years. ② Indonesia achieved the most 
remarkable increase during this period, which is about one 
million tons. ③ Malaysia showed a small decrease in 2010 
from 2004. ④ As Malaysia did in 2010, India’s production 
also declined. ⑤ Vietnam produced the least amount of 
rubber among the five countries both in 2004 and 2010.
30. H. Mephisto에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
H. Mephisto is a kind of roundworms living deep 
underground on Earth. Its name comes from Mephistopheles, 
which means “one who dislikes the light.” It was recently 
discovered even 1.3 kilometers below the ground in a South 
African gold mine. It only measures from 0.52 to 0.56 
millimeters in length, which may sound so small, but it is 
millions of times bigger than the bacteria it feeds on. It 
survives huge pressure from the ground above. In addition, it 
lives in groundwater with extremely low levels of oxygen. 
No wonder it is also called a devil’s worm.
* roundworm: 선형동물
① 빛을 싫어한다는 뜻이 이름에 담겨있다.
② 최근에 지하 1.3km 지점에서 발견되었다.
③ 자신보다 몸집이 큰 박테리아를 먹는다.

31. People think identical twins are exactly alike in every 
way: they look alike, they dress in matching clothes, and 
they share the same likes and dislikes. Parents of identical 
twins, however, know differently. In fact, identical twins 
are              individuals. For example, my own children 
have always shown about a twenty­five percent difference 
in their weight. Also, they don’t act alike either. One likes 
to dance; the other likes to play basketball. Certainly, we 
encourage them to pursue their individual interests, but 
they decide to do these activities all on their own.
① active
② paired
③ unique
④ talented
⑤ thoughtful
32. One late evening in August of 1952, in a theater in 
New York, a man just opened and closed a piano cover 
three times before an audience, not hitting any keys 
for four minutes and thirty­three seconds.  It was John 
Cage’s 4′33″, the famous musical composition that consists 
of             . Cage believed the audience could feel music 
fully without the artist. Therefore, the only way to prove 
his belief was to remove the artist from the process of 
creation. In 4′33″, neither artist nor composer had any 
impact on the piece, so that Cage had no way of controlling 
what sounds would be heard by the audience.
* piece: 곡, 작품
① lyrics
② chorus
③ silence
④ laughing
33. A tornado touched down in Hammond on June 20, 2002, 
with tragic results. Towering Pines, the wilderness preserve 
owned and maintained by the town, was largely destroyed. 
The tornado was, according to all weather experts in the 
area, a very rare case in New England. Captain Maria 
Hinojosa of the New England Weather Bureau says, “The 
Hammond tornado was like a snowstorm in South Africa, or 
a drought in the rain forest. It wasn’t impossible. But it is 
one of those things that reminds you that weather is         
.” [3점]
* wilderness preserve: 야생 보호 구역
① rarely variable
② regionally forecast
③ gradually improving
④ highly unpredictable
⑤ constantly controlled
34. The desire to have a fulfilling job ― a career that provides 
a deep sense of purpose, and reflects our values, passions 
and personality ― is a(n)                        . The word 
‘fulfillment’ does not even appear in the famous dictionary, A 
Dictionary of the English Language, published in 1755. For 
centuries, most people of the Western world were busy 
struggling to meet their basic needs. They could not care 
about whether they had an exciting career that used their 
talents and improved their well­being. Any idea of fulfillment 
didn’t exist in their minds. But today, the spread of material 
richness has freed our minds to pursue fulfillment from our 
work. [3점]
① unclear idea
② natural feeling
③ moral principle
④ modern concept
⑤ unexpected result
35. The Olympics gives a good chance of                    . 
It can be found on the streets of many cities in the host 
countries. Many people, speaking many different languages, 
are visiting these cities. Each brings their own culture with 
them and changes the entire area into one big melting pot. 
A little part of everyone will be changed through their 
experiences in the world sporting event. This great cultural 
exchange will very likely help improve our understanding of 
the world around us, all through sports games.
① creating jobs
② sharing cultures
③ promoting tourism
④ encouraging sports
⑤ inviting investment
36. When you write e­mail messages to people you don’t know well 
or to people of higher position, there are a few things that you 
need to remember. One of them is                              . 
We would suggest that you don’t burden your readers with 
messages that are too long or include unnecessary information. If, 
for example, you need to cancel an appointment or miss class 
because you are ill, there is no need to describe the illness. A 
simple statement that you are ill and unable to get to class or to 
an appointment is fine.
① to use common expressions
② to express requests politely
③ to keep your messages brief
④ to start with casual greetings
⑤ to respond to messages quickly

Every culture has a number of social values. There are 
tensions between each value and an opposing one.     (A)    , 
one of the primary tensions in American culture is the one 
between freedom and prohibition. Americans consider 
freedom an essential right. They have fought many wars to 
protect it, and are willing to die to maintain it.     (B)    , 
American culture has put much emphasis on prohibition as 
well. They believe they shouldn’t drink too much, play too 
much, or show off too much wealth. In fact, many of them 
often face the conflict between these two necessary values.

Winston Churchill, a former British prime minister, was 
an amateur artist, and Henry Luce, an American 
publisher, kept one of Churchill’s landscape paintings 
hanging in his office in New York.
(A) A few days later, however, the painting was shipped 
back, but slightly changed: a single sheep now grazed 
peacefully in the picture.
(B) The next day, to Luce’s horror, Churchill’s secretary 
called and asked him to send the painting to England. 
Luce did so, worried that he had perhaps upset the 
prime minister.
(C) On a tour through the United States, Churchill visited 
Luce in his office and the two men looked at the 
painting together. Luce said, “It’s a good picture, but I 
think it needs something more in the grassland ― a 
sheep, perhaps.”

곳은? [3점]
But, as the earth’s surface is curved, there is a path 
that looks curved and hence longer on a flat map, but 
which is actually shorter.
Imagine that you wanted to travel from New York to 
Madrid, two cities that are at almost the same latitude. ( ① ) 
If the earth were flat, the shortest route would be to head 
straight east. ( ② ) If you did that, you would arrive in 
Madrid after travelling 3,707 miles. ( ③ ) You can get there 
in 3,605 miles if you follow the great­circle route, which is 
to first head northeast, then gradually turn east, and then 
southeast. ( ④ ) The difference in distance between the 
two routes is due to the earth’s curved surface. ( ⑤ ) 
Airlines know this, and arrange for their pilots to follow 
great­circle routes.

In one study, Sarah Pressman and Sheldon Cohen studied 
autobiographies written by study participants including 
psychologists, poets, and novelists. They counted the 
number of relational words that people used in their 
autobiographies, words like father, brother, or sister, as 
well as pronouns like we. Pressman and Cohen then proved 
the connection between how often people used relational 
words and how long they lived. They found that the authors 
who heavily mentioned social roles in their life stories 
lived, on average, five years longer than those who did not.

[41~42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
What do you get from the air around you? You can’t see 
it, but you take it in every breath. It’s a gas called oxygen. 
All animals need oxygen. Animals that live in water get 
their oxygen from the water. Plants also need gases from 
the air. They need carbon dioxide to make food during the 
day and oxygen to use food at night.
Where do these gases come from? They come from 
plants and animals! Plants make oxygen, a gas that 
animals need. Animals give off carbon dioxide, a gas that 
plants need. Animals and plants take part in the carbon 
dioxide and oxygen cycles. The carbon dioxide and oxygen 
cycles are the              of these two gases. The gases 
move from one population to another in both water and 
land ecosystems. If gases were used up instead of being 
exchanged, living things would die.

(A)
Do you know why the Great Wall was built? There is a 
legend behind its construction. After uniting the separate 
kingdoms, Emperor Qin Shi Huang enjoyed nationwide peace 
and a life of luxury. One day, he suddenly feared his death 
and the loss of his power. (a) He decided to get the elixir 
of life.

So (c) he ordered a strong wall to be built to keep out the 
northern forces. This is why the Great Wall was built.
(D)
At that time, a man named Lu Sheng volunteered to bring

give it, but had given (e) him a secret book instead.
