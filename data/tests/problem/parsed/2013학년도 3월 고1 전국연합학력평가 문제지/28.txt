Unfortunately, many insects don’t live through the cold 
winter. Others, however, have come up with clever plans to 
① survive until spring. For example, some flies stay in 
corners of a warm house over the winter, so it’s ② unlikely 
to see them flying outside. Certain honeybees pack together 
in a small space and move their wings quickly to produce
heat, so that they can keep ③ warm. Some mosquitoes, like 
frogs, sleep through the winter cold. This is because they 
cannot move around when the temperature goes ④ up. In 
spring, the females slowly become ⑤ active, flying around 
looking for food ― fresh blood.
