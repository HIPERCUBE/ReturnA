In one study, Sarah Pressman and Sheldon Cohen studied 
autobiographies written by study participants including 
psychologists, poets, and novelists. They counted the 
number of relational words that people used in their 
autobiographies, words like father, brother, or sister, as 
well as pronouns like we. Pressman and Cohen then proved 
the connection between how often people used relational 
words and how long they lived. They found that the authors 
who heavily mentioned social roles in their life stories 
lived, on average, five years longer than those who did not.
