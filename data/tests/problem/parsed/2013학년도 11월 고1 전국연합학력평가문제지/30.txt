30. Clyde W. Tombaugh에관한다음글의내용과일치하지않는것은?
Clyde W. Tombaugh, an American astronomer, was born in
1906. Being poor, he couldn’t attend college but he continued to
study on his own. In 1926, he built his first telescope, but he
was dissatisfied with the result. He determined to master
optics, and built two more telescopes in the next two years,
grinding his own lenses and mirrors. Using these homemade
telescopes, he made drawings of the planets Mars and Jupiter
and sent them to the Lowell Observatory. The astronomers at
Lowell were so impressed with the young amateur’s powers of
observation they invited him to work at the observatory. Staying
there, he discovered hundreds of new stars. The young
astronomer came into the spotlight in the field of astronomy
when he discovered Pluto on February 18, 1930.
