Let’s think about waiting in line. Whether you’re at a bank,
supermarket, or amusement park, waiting in line is probably
not your idea of fun. Consider the almost universal
motivation to get through the line as quickly as possible.
Under what circumstances would you be willing to let
another person cut in front of you in the line? Small changes
in the way that requests are made can often lead to some
startlingly big results. But is it possible that just a single
word from a requester could drastically increase the
likelihood that you’d say, “Yes, go ahead”?
Yes―and the single word is because. Behavioral scientist
Ellen Langer and her colleagues decided to put the
of this word to the test. In one study, Langer
arranged for a stranger to approach someone waiting in line
to use a photocopier and simply ask, “Excuse me, I have five
pages. May I use the copy machine?” Faced with this direct
request to cut ahead in the line, 60 percent of the people
were willing to agree to allow the stranger to go ahead of
them. However, when the stranger made the request with a
reason(“May I use the copy machine, because I’m in a
rush?”), 94 percent of the people said yes. After all,
providing a solid reason for the request justifies asking to
jump ahead.
