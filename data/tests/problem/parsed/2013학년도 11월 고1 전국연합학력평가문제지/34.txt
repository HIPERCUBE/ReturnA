immediate moment and beyond personal needs and desires to
imagine the possible consequences of our choices and behavior

virtual rehearsal that allows us to examine different courses of
action to determine the morally best thing to do. The capacity

of how they are affected. Only by conceiving what we
ourselves would feel in the situation can we understand how
they feel. [3점]
