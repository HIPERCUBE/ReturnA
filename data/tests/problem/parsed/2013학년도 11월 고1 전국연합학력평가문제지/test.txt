While most experts say eight hours of sleep is ideal, the
truth is it all depends on how you feel. Some people do well
with seven hours or less, while others require nine or more
to be at their best. If you are ill or under tremendous stress,
you will probably need to sleep longer than you usually do.
The best indicator of how much sleep you need should be
based on how you feel. Keep in mind that sometimes we fool
ourselves into thinking that we’re getting enough sleep. If
you are getting sufficient sleep, you should feel refreshed and
not have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.

25.다음글의주제로가장적절한것은?
What Hippocratic ideas are still in practice today? Even
though Hippocrates lived nearly 2,500 years ago, many of his
ideas sound very familiar today. He would inquire about the
family health history to see if any relatives had suffered from
similar diseases. He asked questions about the patient’s home
to see if his or her environment might be causing the illness.
He discovered that diet played an important role in preventing
disease. Hippocrates was the first to understand the physical
illness caused by emotional stress. He even made suggestions
on what we call bedside manner. He said physicians should pay
as much attention to the comfort and welfare of the patient as
to the disease itself.
① various fields of Western medicine
② common beliefs in Hippocrates’ time
③ diagnoses and treatments of ancient times
④ preventive measures in traditional medicine
⑤ Hippocratic ideas remaining in today’s medicine
26. 다음글의제목으로가장적절한 것은?
One of the ways to identify your values is to look at what
frustrates or upsets you. Anger often indicates an ignored value
or a misdirected passion. Think of specific times when you
were mad or frustrated. What about these situations upset you
most? Write down your descriptions of them. To find your
values, reflect on the words or phrases you’ve written to focus
on what’s most important to you. For example, if you get
annoyed when someone asks you about something he could
figure out for himself, perhaps you value resourcefulness,
independence, or taking care of oneself.
① Negative Feelings: Clues to Your Values
②Moral Value: A Helper to Make Decisions
③ Say Goodbye to Your Bad Feelings
④Make Sure You Hide Your Anger
⑤ Crafting Your Vision and Passion

One way to make a pursuer work harder is to zigzag. A
rabbit running from a coyote, for example, does not run
endlessly in a straight line. Instead, it moves quickly back and
forth, (A) forcing / forced the coyote to change direction and
make sharp turns, too. Zigzagging is easier for a rabbit, which
is small, than for the larger coyote. The coyote also cannot
tell (B) what / when the rabbit will run this way or that, so it
cannot plan its next move. In this way, the rabbit makes the
chase more (C) difficult / difficultly and tiring for the coyote.
Though a coyote may still succeed in catching its prey, there is
a chance that it may tire out, give up, and go look for an easier
meal.
(A) (B) (C)

② forcing …… when …… difficultly

Executives’ emotional intelligence — their self-awareness,
empathy, and rapport with others — has clear links to their
own performance. But new research shows that a leader’s
emotional style also drives everyone else’s moods and
behaviors. It’s ① similar to “Smile and the whole world smiles
with you.” Emotional intelligence ② travels through an
organization like electricity over telephone wires. Depressed,
ruthless bosses create ③ toxic organizations filled with
negative underachievers. But if you’re an inspirational leader,
you cultivate positive employees who ④ avoid the tough
challenges. Emotional leadership isn’t just putting on a game
face every day. It means understanding your ⑤ impact on
others — then adjusting your style accordingly.

30. Clyde W. Tombaugh에관한다음글의내용과일치하지않는것은?
Clyde W. Tombaugh, an American astronomer, was born in
1906. Being poor, he couldn’t attend college but he continued to
study on his own. In 1926, he built his first telescope, but he
was dissatisfied with the result. He determined to master
optics, and built two more telescopes in the next two years,
grinding his own lenses and mirrors. Using these homemade
telescopes, he made drawings of the planets Mars and Jupiter
and sent them to the Lowell Observatory. The astronomers at
Lowell were so impressed with the young amateur’s powers of
observation they invited him to work at the observatory. Staying
there, he discovered hundreds of new stars. The young
astronomer came into the spotlight in the field of astronomy
when he discovered Pluto on February 18, 1930.

31. Consider how running, yoga, and weight lifting
. Running improves aerobic capacity,
which in turn will enhance your endurance when weight lifting
or through a long yoga class. The increased flexibility from
yoga will lengthen your running stride, allowing you to run
smoother and faster. Your improved flexibility will also
increase your range of motion while weight lifting, which in
turn will make your muscles stronger. Lifting weights
increases muscle strength, which will make you a stronger
runner and improve your endurance and balance when
maintaining difficult yoga postures. All of these activities
reinforce one another, and the total benefit is much greater
than the sum of its parts.
* aerobic capacity: 유산소능력
① complement one another
② refresh your mind and body
③ get you interested in exercising
④ help you effectively lose weight
⑤ increase counter effects among them
32. People may or may not remember what you said or did,
but they will always remember .
Have you ever noticed when people enter a room, they bring
a type of energy with them? For example, you’re at your
office talking with someone when another person approaches
you and you get a feeling of, “Oh great, I’m so glad he’s
coming.” Or maybe it’s a feeling of, “Oh man, he’s coming
over here. Let me get out of here before he comes, because
he’s either going to say something I don’t like or try to
make me feel inferior.” What energy do you carry when you
enter a room? Are you a person who brightens up the room?
Or are you bringing in storm clouds?
① who you got along with
② how you made them feel
③ what you were engaged in
④ why you approached them
⑤what you were arguing about
33. People are loyal to their e-mail. There appears to be an
unwritten expectation that you are accessible and available, so
if someone sends you something, you will read it, understand
it, and respond immediately. That’s the deal. And when you
break the deal, you are not a team player, you are not
competent, and something is wrong with you. Every day, and
sometimes constantly throughout the day, you have to check
your e-mail. Why? You may have received an e-mail that, if
left unopened, will have an impact on how you are perceived.
E-mail has become a(n) . It says, “Read
me, feed me, do what I say.” It demands our attention,
directs our work, and has a controlling presence in our lives.
① attentive worker
② electronic tyrant
③ friendly assistant
④ systematic organizer
⑤ incompetent respondent
34. Ethical decision making requires us to look beyond the
immediate moment and beyond personal needs and desires to
imagine the possible consequences of our choices and behavior
on self and others. In its most elemental sense, moral
imagination is about in our interactions
with others. In some sense, moral imagination is a dramatic
virtual rehearsal that allows us to examine different courses of
action to determine the morally best thing to do. The capacity
for empathy is crucial to moral imagination. As we have no
immediate experience of what others feel, we can have no idea
of how they are affected. Only by conceiving what we
ourselves would feel in the situation can we understand how
they feel. [3점]
① picturing various outcomes 　
② recognizing your identity
③ revisiting past memories
④ generating emotions
⑤ building solid trust
35. Humans who lived as hunter-gatherers more than 10,000
years ago fitted into ecosystems by acting as predators, and on
occasion they probably also served as prey. The role of
humans in today’s ecosystems differs from that of early human
settlements. Today, humans in almost every part of the world
. People have
detached themselves from most ecosystems. Modern humans
also tend to negatively affect ecosystems in ways that the
earliest civilizations did not. One aspect of the study of
ecosystems in environmental science provides a clue as to how
disconnected humans have become from nature. Many
ecosystems are named for the dominant species within them.
Therefore, the world contains coral reef ecosystems, evergreen
forest ecosystems, grassland ecosystems, and so on, but
environmental science contains no “human ecosystems.” [3점]
① have a desire to define themselves in nature
② do not ignore the impact of natural phenomena
③ no longer interact with nature as they once did
④ show greater interests in ecosystems than ever
⑤ try to restore the ecosystem as fast as they can

36. John Ray, the English naturalist, believed there was a good
reason why birds reproduce by laying eggs. He pointed out that
if their young developed in an internal womb, pregnant birds
would be too heavy to fly and would therefore be very
vulnerable to predators. Consequently, pregnant birds would be
killed, and before long all birds would (A) . If birds
bore live young, there could be no birds. Reproduction by
egg-laying was one example of the way birds were fitted to
life in their environment, and close examination revealed that
every type of plant and animal was equipped for its way of life.
Ray saw (B) as an expression of the way every
organism was fitted for its assigned role in nature. [3점]

37. In order to understand why an individual fails or succeeds at
some task which confronts him, we must know two things: how
much ability he has for the task in question and how strongly
motivated he is. Failure may be due to lack of ability or to lack
of motivation. Success, (A) , requires a high degree of
motivation working with a high degree of ability. In everyday
situations, the measure of motivation is the amount of time and
effort which the individual will devote to the activity in
question. (B) , a motivated pianist will practice from
six to eight hours every day to become truly great. Even with
such work, success will be gained only if the individual also has
great inborn ability.
(A) (B)
① as a result …… Moreover
② as a result …… However
③ in addition …… Nevertheless
④ on the other hand …… Otherwise
⑤ on the other hand …… For example

Nature is timed to the alternating rhythm of light and dark
produced by Earth’s rotation.
(A) The loss of rhythmic light and dark exposure will only
worsen their condition. Simply moving the patient to a bed
that is near a window and darkening the room at night can
significantly improve mental state.
(B) Birds sing, and blossoms open and close in tune with this
twenty-four-hour cycle. Daylight also sets the pace for
the activity of our mind. When deprived of regular
intervals of dark and light, the mind can lose its bearings.
(C) This is especially true with elderly people. For example,
some older people whose brain function is fine at home can
become confused when hospitalized where artificial light is
always on.

The translated text helped introduce to Europeans a radical
new way to count and do math― using what are now called
Arabic numerals: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0.
Al-Khwarizmi was a mathematician, astronomer, and
geographer. ( ① ) Born in Persia, he eventually found a place
at the renowned House of Wisdom in Baghdad― the greatest
center of learning in Islam’s golden age. ( ② ) While there,
Al-Khwarizmi wrote a book explaining Hindu concepts in
mathematics, including the symbols used in India for counting.
( ③ ) The book was translated from Arabic into Latin, three
hundred years after his death. ( ④ ) These were much
easier to use than Roman numerals, especially for division and
multiplication. ( ⑤ ) They eventually came to be used
throughout the world.

In one study, subjects listened to four music records and
then were asked to rate how much they liked each one. As a
reward for participating in the study, they were told that
they could have the record of their choice when they made
additional ratings on a second occasion. When the subjects
returned for the second session, they were told that one of
the four records would not be available. The excluded
record varied from subject to subject. It was always the
record ranked third best by that individual in the first set of
ratings. The subjects listened to the four records again and
made their second set of ratings. The researcher found that
the ratings of the excluded records increased significantly.
In other words, the record that a subject could not have
became all the more desirable.
According to a study, when subjects know that a certain
record is (A) , their desire for the record becomes
(B) .
(A) (B)
① useful …… stimulated
② unavailable …… stronger
③ popular …… lessened
④ novel …… fulfilled
⑤ excluded …… weaker
[41~42] 다음글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
Let’s think about waiting in line. Whether you’re at a bank,
supermarket, or amusement park, waiting in line is probably
not your idea of fun. Consider the almost universal
motivation to get through the line as quickly as possible.
Under what circumstances would you be willing to let
another person cut in front of you in the line? Small changes
in the way that requests are made can often lead to some
startlingly big results. But is it possible that just a single
word from a requester could drastically increase the
likelihood that you’d say, “Yes, go ahead”?
Yes―and the single word is because. Behavioral scientist
Ellen Langer and her colleagues decided to put the
of this word to the test. In one study, Langer
arranged for a stranger to approach someone waiting in line
to use a photocopier and simply ask, “Excuse me, I have five
pages. May I use the copy machine?” Faced with this direct
request to cut ahead in the line, 60 percent of the people
were willing to agree to allow the stranger to go ahead of
them. However, when the stranger made the request with a
reason(“May I use the copy machine, because I’m in a
rush?”), 94 percent of the people said yes. After all,
providing a solid reason for the request justifies asking to
jump ahead.

(A)
I was a daughter of parents who never finished high school.
They were hard workers, but our family could not escape
from our tough life. Books were a shelter and a friend to me
when that shelter wasn’t available in real life. My mom
sought that shelter, too. (a) She read great books from the
library.
(B)
My mom always knew that I wanted to be a writer. Giving
me the story of a girl who achieved her dream, (b) she tried
to give me the message that nothing was off limits for me as
long as I could learn. Reading the story as a child, I felt
Francie was showing me that education was my way to have
what I wanted, too. I learned quickly to write the sad
realities of my life beautifully.
(C)
Eventually, I too became a writer. Since the day my mom
gave that book to me, I’ve read it several times. I have had a
tradition of reading it before every book I write. Whenever I
turned to the book, it gave me wisdom and the simple
understanding of real life that (c) she had tried to teach me.
(D)
One day when I was 12, my mom gave me a book. Reading
that book, I felt I was like Francie Nolan, the star of the
book. (d) She was an urban child who wanted to be a
writer. Her family was poor, but her mother, Katie, taught
her that education was the only way to leave behind their
hard life. It reminded me of my own mother, who did the
same for me until (e) she died when I was 19.
