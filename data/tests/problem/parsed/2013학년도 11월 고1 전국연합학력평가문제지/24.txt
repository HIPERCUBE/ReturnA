While most experts say eight hours of sleep is ideal, the
truth is it all depends on how you feel. Some people do well
with seven hours or less, while others require nine or more
to be at their best. If you are ill or under tremendous stress,
you will probably need to sleep longer than you usually do.
The best indicator of how much sleep you need should be
based on how you feel. Keep in mind that sometimes we fool
ourselves into thinking that we’re getting enough sleep. If
you are getting sufficient sleep, you should feel refreshed and
not have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.
