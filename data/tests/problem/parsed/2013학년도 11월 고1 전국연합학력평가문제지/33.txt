33. People are loyal to their e-mail. There appears to be an
unwritten expectation that you are accessible and available, so
if someone sends you something, you will read it, understand
it, and respond immediately. That’s the deal. And when you
break the deal, you are not a team player, you are not
competent, and something is wrong with you. Every day, and
sometimes constantly throughout the day, you have to check
your e-mail. Why? You may have received an e-mail that, if
left unopened, will have an impact on how you are perceived.
E-mail has become a(n) . It says, “Read
me, feed me, do what I say.” It demands our attention,
directs our work, and has a controlling presence in our lives.
