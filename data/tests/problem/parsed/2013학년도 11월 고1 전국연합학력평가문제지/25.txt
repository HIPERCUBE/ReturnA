What Hippocratic ideas are still in practice today? Even
though Hippocrates lived nearly 2,500 years ago, many of his
ideas sound very familiar today. He would inquire about the
family health history to see if any relatives had suffered from
similar diseases. He asked questions about the patient’s home
to see if his or her environment might be causing the illness.
He discovered that diet played an important role in preventing
disease. Hippocrates was the first to understand the physical
illness caused by emotional stress. He even made suggestions
on what we call bedside manner. He said physicians should pay
as much attention to the comfort and welfare of the patient as
to the disease itself.
