In one study, subjects listened to four music records and
then were asked to rate how much they liked each one. As a
reward for participating in the study, they were told that
they could have the record of their choice when they made
additional ratings on a second occasion. When the subjects
returned for the second session, they were told that one of
the four records would not be available. The excluded
record varied from subject to subject. It was always the
record ranked third best by that individual in the first set of
ratings. The subjects listened to the four records again and
made their second set of ratings. The researcher found that
the ratings of the excluded records increased significantly.
In other words, the record that a subject could not have
became all the more desirable.
