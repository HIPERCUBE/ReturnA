(A)
I was a daughter of parents who never finished high school.
They were hard workers, but our family could not escape
from our tough life. Books were a shelter and a friend to me
when that shelter wasn’t available in real life. My mom
sought that shelter, too. (a) She read great books from the
library.
(B)
My mom always knew that I wanted to be a writer. Giving
me the story of a girl who achieved her dream, (b) she tried
to give me the message that nothing was off limits for me as
long as I could learn. Reading the story as a child, I felt
Francie was showing me that education was my way to have
what I wanted, too. I learned quickly to write the sad
realities of my life beautifully.
(C)
Eventually, I too became a writer. Since the day my mom
gave that book to me, I’ve read it several times. I have had a
tradition of reading it before every book I write. Whenever I
turned to the book, it gave me wisdom and the simple
understanding of real life that (c) she had tried to teach me.
(D)
One day when I was 12, my mom gave me a book. Reading
that book, I felt I was like Francie Nolan, the star of the
book. (d) She was an urban child who wanted to be a
writer. Her family was poor, but her mother, Katie, taught
her that education was the only way to leave behind their
hard life. It reminded me of my own mother, who did the
same for me until (e) she died when I was 19.
