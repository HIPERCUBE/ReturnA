31. Consider how running, yoga, and weight lifting
. Running improves aerobic capacity,
which in turn will enhance your endurance when weight lifting
or through a long yoga class. The increased flexibility from
yoga will lengthen your running stride, allowing you to run
smoother and faster. Your improved flexibility will also
increase your range of motion while weight lifting, which in
turn will make your muscles stronger. Lifting weights
increases muscle strength, which will make you a stronger
runner and improve your endurance and balance when
maintaining difficult yoga postures. All of these activities
reinforce one another, and the total benefit is much greater
than the sum of its parts.
