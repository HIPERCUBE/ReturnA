One of the ways to identify your values is to look at what
frustrates or upsets you. Anger often indicates an ignored value
or a misdirected passion. Think of specific times when you
were mad or frustrated. What about these situations upset you
most? Write down your descriptions of them. To find your
values, reflect on the words or phrases you’ve written to focus
on what’s most important to you. For example, if you get
annoyed when someone asks you about something he could
figure out for himself, perhaps you value resourcefulness,
independence, or taking care of oneself.
