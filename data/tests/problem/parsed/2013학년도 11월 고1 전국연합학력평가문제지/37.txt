37. In order to understand why an individual fails or succeeds at
some task which confronts him, we must know two things: how

motivated he is. Failure may be due to lack of ability or to lack
of motivation. Success, (A) , requires a high degree of
motivation working with a high degree of ability. In everyday
situations, the measure of motivation is the amount of time and
effort which the individual will devote to the activity in
