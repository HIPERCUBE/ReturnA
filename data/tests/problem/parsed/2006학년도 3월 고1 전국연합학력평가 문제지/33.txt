33. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경을 가장 잘 나타낸 것은?
Last Wednesday afternoon I was in my school library and
had been sitting on the sofa for forty minutes. When the
bell rang, I got up, but my foot was asleep from sitting
there for so long and I fell down! When I fell, I twisted my
ankle, but I didn’t know that. So I stumbled again and fell
over the sofa when I tried to get up. Unluckily, there were
two really handsome boys in the library at the time. They
started laughing and pointing at me. At the moment I really
didn’t know what to do.
