42. You should not watch television and eat at the same time.
You just get lost in a program and can’t stop eating too
much. You’ll eat anything─ the worst things─when the
television is on. You may eat unhealthy food like cookies,
snacks, and fast food. It is just like hanging around with the
wrong friends in school. You’ll do things you wouldn’t do if
you didn’t meet them.
