Once, on a math test, the first page was full of
instructions. Because the test time was not very long and I
thought I understood the instructions, I just went ahead and
started to work. I spent almost all my time on Problem 5,
so I couldn’t finish the test. I didn’t realize my mistake until
my test was returned. In the instructions, in large letters,
the teacher had said that Problem 5 was only for the
students in the advanced class. I learned my lesson that
reading the instructions makes a difference.
