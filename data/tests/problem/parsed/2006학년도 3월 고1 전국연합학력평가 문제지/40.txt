One day, a friend of mine came to me and said, “Help
me, please! I forgot to read Romeo and Juliet, and I have
to turn in the paper tomorrow!” Since I had just read the
book and turned in the paper, I changed the name, printed
it out, and gave it to her. She turned it in to her teacher. I
thought I should do that as a friend. And anyway, who was
I hurting? Well, I soon found out. When the grades got
back, I was shocked! I received a D-, while my friend had
gotten a B+. And on the same paper! Who could I tell? So,
don’t share your papers. You may feel like a fool when the
grades return.
