There was once a dog which had the bad habit of biting anyone
who came near it. For this reason, its master hung a little bell
around its neck. So when the dog approached, everybody could
hear its bell ringing and avoid its sharp teeth and powerful
jaws. The dog was very proud that the tinkle of its little
bell scared men away. A wise old dog saw this and scolded it:
“The bell around your neck is not your (A) but your (B) !”

【 46 - 48】다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
David is a high school freshman. He likes to help others.
Whether it’s with his family or friends, David has tried to
be there for them.
When David’s sister was in danger of failing math, David
didn’t only help her study, but he also tried to make it
more fun. He made up examples that were related to things
she was interested in. His sister studied math with interest
and passed the examination.
Last year, his friend Sara failed to get into the school
basketball team. David wanted to help her. He joined a
community league team with Sara and practiced together.
Sara is ready to get into the school team now. She says,
“David is the most ______________ person I know.”
David sometimes felt like he was a little hard on himself.
But over time he has learned that what he did for others
has returned in even greater amounts. “Every time I do
something for someone, I enjoy the feeling of helping,” he
says. “I feel good about myself because I can do something
for others.”
