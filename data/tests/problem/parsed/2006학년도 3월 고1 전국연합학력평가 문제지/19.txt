19. 밑줄 친 This가 가리키는 것을 그림에서 고르면? [1점]
This is a very useful instrument. It has a thin glass tube.
One end of the tube looks like a bulb, or a ball. The glass
tube is usually filled with mercury. Sometimes colored
alcohol is used instead of mercury. You use it to read
changes in temperature. That is, you can measure how hot
or cold the air is.
*mercury: 수은
