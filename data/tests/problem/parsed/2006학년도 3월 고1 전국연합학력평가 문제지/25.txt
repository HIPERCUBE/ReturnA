25. I live in California, and we have earthquakes here all the
time. Sometimes they’re strong, but sometimes we don’t
even notice them. One evening I was sitting outside. The
ground began to shake very gently. At first, I wasn’t sure it
was an earthquake. It felt like I was in the water─ in a
swimming pool where the water moved softly under me. I
know this sounds strange, but it was almost relaxing. I felt
_____________. Perhaps because of this experience, I’m not
as worried about earthquakes as I used to be.
