43. I was the odd duck in the family. I was very different
from my brothers and sisters. I liked different music,
different foods, different clothes, just about everything. I
always felt I was a stranger to my family. One day we
were talking about which team was better, the Mets or the
Yankees. I said the Mets were better; they said the
Yankees. No one gave in. The debate became heated. My
brothers and sisters shouted at me. They even insulted me.
Hearing this, Father said to us, “You know, the world can’t
function only on yes men. Our society depends on different
opinions. We should respect difference.” For the first time, I
was proud that I was different. [3점]
