I am writing this letter because of the long delays and the
bad service I received from your staff. I was at the
emergency room at your hospital yesterday. I had to wait
twenty minutes just to get my forms; the nurse was too
busy talking to her friend on the phone. After filling out the
forms, I had to wait about two hours to meet the doctor. I
am upset that I wasted a whole afternoon for simple
service. I would like to know what you would do about this.
