18. 밑줄 친 them 중, 나머지 넷과 가리키는 바가 다른 하나는?
Suppose you have an eye problem. Your friend tries to
help you. He says, “Try these glasses. I have worn ① them
for ten years, and they really helped. I have another pair of
glasses at home. I can wear ② them.”
You try ③ them, but it is worse now. You say, “Oh, I
don’t think these work for me. I can’t see anything.”
Your friend says, “Why not? They worked well for me.
Try ④ them again.”
“I am wearing ⑤ them, but I can’t see things,” you say.
Your friend says, “You are unthankful.” What do you think of
your friend?
