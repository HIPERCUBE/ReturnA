Daphne knew she could not escape. But she had lived free
all her life and would not give up her freedom now. So she
ran faster still. But Daphne couldn’t run faster than Apollo,
and soon she felt her legs weakening and her breath growing
short. Just when she could run no farther, she reached the
river that ran through her father’s forest. “Father, oh,
Father, help me!” she cried.
