I am opening my window to see our beautiful garden.
There are many things in the garden. At first, I can see
vegetables and onions. They are my mother’s favorites. I
can see banana trees in the garden. They have a lot of
bananas. I love to eat them. I can hear sweet sounds, too.
Where are they coming from? There is a bird’s family in the
banana leaves. The mother bird is feeding her babies in the
nest. They are very cute. Oh, I can smell the fresh scent of
soap. My mother is hanging clothes on the line. What a
peaceful morning!
