31. When two cultures come into contact, they do not 
exchange every cultural item. If that were the case, there 
would be no cultural differences in the world today. Instead, 
only a small number of cultural elements ever spread from 
one culture to another. Which cultural item is accepted 
depends largely on the item’s use and compatibility with 
already existing cultural traits. For example, it is not likely 
that men’s hair dyes designed to “get out the gray” will spread 
into parts of rural Africa where a person’s status is elevated 
with advancing years. Even when a(n)  is 
consistent with a society’s needs, there is still no guarantee 
that it will be accepted. For example, most people in the 
United States using US customary units (e.g., inch, foot, yard, 
mile, etc.) have resisted adopting the metric system even 
though making such a change would enable US citizens to 
interface with the rest of the world more efficiently. [3점]
