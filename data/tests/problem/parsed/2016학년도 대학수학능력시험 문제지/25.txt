25. Protogenes에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Known for his devotion to each of his paintings, Protogenes 
was an ancient Greek painter and a rival of Apelles. He was 
born in Caunus, on the coast of Caria, but lived most of his 
life in Rhodes. Little else is known of him. But there are 
some accounts of his paintings. The Ialysus and the Satyr 
were the most well-known among his works. Protogenes spent 
approximately seven years painting the Ialysus, a depiction of a 
local hero of a town in Rhodes. After remaining in Rhodes for 
at least 200 years, it was carried off to Rome. There later it 
was destroyed by fire. Protogenes worked on the Satyr during 
Demetrius Poliorcetes’ attack on Rhodes from 305 to 304 B.C. 
Interestingly, the garden in which he painted the Satyr was in 
the middle of the enemy’s camp. Protogenes is said to have been 
about seventy years of age when the Satyr was completed.
