our biology. Infants enter the world ready to respond to pain as 
bad and to sweet (up to a point) as good. In many situations,

wander around, you find a large rock that provides some shelter 
from the fury of the elements. The biologist Michel Cabanac 
would call the experience of that moment intensely pleasurable
