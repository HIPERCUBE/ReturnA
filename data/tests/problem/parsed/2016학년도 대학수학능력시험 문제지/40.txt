Performance must be judged in terms of what is under 
the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than 
those influences on performance that are beyond their 
control. There can be broad, influential factors, sometimes 
of an economic nature, that hold down the performance 
of everyone being judged. One example is in sales. If there 
is a general downturn in the economy and products or 
services are not being purchased with the same frequency 
as in the previous year, sales could be down, for example, 
by an average of 15%. This 15% (actually －15%) figure 
would then represent “average” performance. Perhaps the 
best salesperson in the year had only a 3% drop in sales 
over the previous year. Thus, “good” performance in this 
situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or 
norm group.
