Performance must be judged in terms of what is under 
the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than 
those influences on performance that are beyond their 
control. There can be broad, influential factors, sometimes 
of an economic nature, that hold down the performance 
of everyone being judged. One example is in sales. If there 
is a general downturn in the economy and products or 
services are not being purchased with the same frequency 
as in the previous year, sales could be down, for example, 
by an average of 15%. This 15% (actually －15%) figure 
would then represent “average” performance. Perhaps the 
best salesperson in the year had only a 3% drop in sales 
over the previous year. Thus, “good” performance in this 
situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or 
norm group.
󰀻
In performance evaluation, we should consider (A)  
factors affecting the individual’s performance rather than 
(B)  figures only.
(A) (B)
① contextual …… put aside
② contextual …… rely on
③ controllable …… put aside
④ positive …… ignore
⑤ positive …… rely on
We might describe science that has no known practical 
value as basic science or basic research. Our exploration of 
worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science, and it is 
easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and 
expense because it has no known practical use. Of course, the 
problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge 
will be of use until we acquire that knowledge. In the middle 
of the 19th century, Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked 
physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with 
electricity and magnetism were. He answered, “Madam, what 
good is a baby?” Of course, Faraday’s experiments were the 
beginning of the electronic age. Many of the practical uses 
of scientific knowledge that fill our world― transistors, 
vaccines, plastics― began as basic research. Basic scientific 
research provides the raw materials that technology and 
engineering use to solve problems. 
Basic scientific research has yet one more important use 
that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely 
functional. Science is the study of nature, and as we learn 
more about how nature works, we learn more about what our 
existence in this universe means for us. The seemingly 
knowledge we gain from space probes to other 
worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the 
scheme of nature. Science tells us where we are and what we 
are, and that knowledge is beyond value.

“Hannah, you look so serious. What are you thinking 
about?” “Oh, Mom, just, you know.” Her mother smiled. 
“You’ll miss this place, won’t you?” Hannah nodded. 
“Quick,” her mother said, “stand over there . . . and smile, 
Hannah. You have such a pretty smile.” (b) She hurried out 
her cell phone, zoomed in on her daughter, and realized 
suddenly that she was looking at a young lady. “You’re all 
grown-up,” she whispered. Hannah took more photos with 
her teachers in the school garden. She wished all the 
memories would remain in her mind forever.
(C)
Hannah struggled with the many class hours, the endless 
assignments, and the exams. However, there were exciting 
events like sports days and school festivals. How could (c) she 
ever forget her second year! She had sung and danced with 
her friends in the festival, part of a sensational performance. 
After that, she had become more confident and active. Her 
thoughts wandering, Hannah vaguely heard her mother’s 
voice. “Here you are!” Her mother hurried over, and gave 
(d) her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug.   
(D)
That day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious 
were ahead. Hannah was nervous and trembling. The principal 
was energetically addressing them, talking of the challenges 
and thrills of high school life, but she could not concentrate.
