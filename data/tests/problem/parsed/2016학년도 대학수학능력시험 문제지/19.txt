I’m leaving early tomorrow morning, finally! I’ve always 
wanted to explore the Amazon, the unknown and mysterious 
world. At this hour, the great Emerald Amazon Explorer should 
be at the port waiting for me to get on board. Freshwater dolphins 
will escort me on the playful river, and 500 species of birds, half 
a dozen species of monkeys, and numerous colorful butterflies 
will welcome me into their kingdom. I wish I could camp in the 
wild and enjoy the company of mosquitos, snakes, and spiders. 
I’d love to make the world’s largest rainforest home. My heart 
swells as much as my chubby bags; yet, I’d better get some sleep 
since a long, tough journey is ahead of me.
