(A)
The midday sun was glorious. The high school grounds 
were filled with well-dressed people, posing in fancy dresses 
and suits for cheerful photographers. Congratulations, hugs, 
and laughter were contagious. Hannah looked at all the 
familiar faces that had been part of (a) her life for the last 
few years. Soon her mother would be joining them. She 
recalled the first day of school when she had stood in that 
same place, in the middle of many anxious freshmen, some 
of whom had become her closest friends.
(B)
“Hannah, you look so serious. What are you thinking 
about?” “Oh, Mom, just, you know.” Her mother smiled. 
“You’ll miss this place, won’t you?” Hannah nodded. 
“Quick,” her mother said, “stand over there . . . and smile, 
Hannah. You have such a pretty smile.” (b) She hurried out 
her cell phone, zoomed in on her daughter, and realized 
suddenly that she was looking at a young lady. “You’re all 
grown-up,” she whispered. Hannah took more photos with 
her teachers in the school garden. She wished all the 
memories would remain in her mind forever.
(C)
Hannah struggled with the many class hours, the endless 
assignments, and the exams. However, there were exciting 
events like sports days and school festivals. How could (c) she 
ever forget her second year! She had sung and danced with 
her friends in the festival, part of a sensational performance. 
After that, she had become more confident and active. Her 
thoughts wandering, Hannah vaguely heard her mother’s 
voice. “Here you are!” Her mother hurried over, and gave 
(d) her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug.   
(D)
That day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious 
were ahead. Hannah was nervous and trembling. The principal 
was energetically addressing them, talking of the challenges 
and thrills of high school life, but she could not concentrate. 
Later, a tall, strict-looking man introduced himself as (e) her 
homeroom teacher. The classroom was old, but neat and 
inviting. Hannah was seated in the fifth row, hallway side, 
even though she had wanted a window seat. High school life 
soon proved as challenging as the principal had predicted.
