Some people make few intentional changes in life. Sure, 
over time they may get fatter, gather lines, and go gray. 
(A) They train for marathons, quit smoking, switch fields, 
write plays, take up the guitar, or learn to tango even if 
they never danced before in their lives. What is the 
difference between these two groups of people? 
(B) But they wear their hair the same way, buy the same 
brand of shoes, eat the same breakfast, and stick to 
routines for no reason other than the ease of a 
comfortable, predictable life. Yet as both research and 
real life show, many others do make important changes.
(C) It’s their perspective. People who change do not question 
whether change is possible or look for reasons they 
cannot change. They simply decide on a change they 
want and do what is necessary to accomplish it. 
Changing, which always stems from a firm decision, 
becomes job number one.
