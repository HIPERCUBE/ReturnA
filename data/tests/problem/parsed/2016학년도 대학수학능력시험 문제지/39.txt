Food intake is essential for the survival of every living 
organism. The failure to detect spoiled or toxic food can 
have deadly consequences. Therefore, it is not surprising that 
humans use all their five senses to analyze food quality. ① A 
first judgment about the value of a food source is made on 
its appearance and smell. ② Food that looks and smells 
attractive is taken into the mouth. ③ The value of a particular 
food is an estimation of how good it is, based on its level of 
vitamins, minerals, or calories. ④ Here, based on a complex 
sensory analysis that is not only restricted to the sense of taste 
but also includes smell, touch, and hearing, the final decision 
whether to swallow or reject food is made. ⑤ Frequently, 
this complex interaction between different senses is 
inappropriately referred to as ‘taste’ although it should be 
better called flavor perception, because it uses multiple 
senses.
