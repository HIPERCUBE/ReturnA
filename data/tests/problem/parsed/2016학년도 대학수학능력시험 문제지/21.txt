The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades 
have been documented with students from different cultures. 
Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding 
all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning, 
we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people 
across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction 
with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather 
than extrinsic. Another consistent research finding is that 
when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain 
some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least 
demanding way of ensuring the reward. Since there are three 
decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system 
of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior 
learning, using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic 
motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective 
approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse 
students.
