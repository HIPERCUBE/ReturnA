We might describe science that has no known practical 
value as basic science or basic research. Our exploration of 
worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science, and it is 
easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and 
expense because it has no known practical use. Of course, the 
problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge 
will be of use until we acquire that knowledge. In the middle 
of the 19th century, Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked 
physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with 
electricity and magnetism were. He answered, “Madam, what 
good is a baby?” Of course, Faraday’s experiments were the 
beginning of the electronic age. Many of the practical uses 
of scientific knowledge that fill our world― transistors, 
vaccines, plastics― began as basic research. Basic scientific 
research provides the raw materials that technology and 
engineering use to solve problems. 
Basic scientific research has yet one more important use 
that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely 
functional. Science is the study of nature, and as we learn 
more about how nature works, we learn more about what our 
existence in this universe means for us. The seemingly 
knowledge we gain from space probes to other 
worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the 
scheme of nature. Science tells us where we are and what we 
are, and that knowledge is beyond value.
