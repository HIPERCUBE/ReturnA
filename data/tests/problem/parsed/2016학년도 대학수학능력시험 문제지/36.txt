Sometimes, after punishment has been administered a 
few times, it needn’t be continued, because the mere threat 
of punishment is enough to induce the desired behavior. 
(A) Avoidance training, however, doesn’t always work in our 
favor. For instance, a child who has been repeatedly 
criticized for poor performance on math may learn to 
dodge difficult math problems in order to avoid further 
punishment.
(B) Unfortunately, because of this avoidance, the child fails 
to develop his math skills and therefore improve the 
capabilities he has, and so a vicious cycle has set in. 
The avoidance must be unlearned through some positive 
experiences with math in order for this cycle to be broken.
(C) Psychologists call this avoidance training because the 
person is learning to avoid the possibility of a punishing 
consequence. Avoidance training is responsible for many 
everyday behaviors. It has taught you to carry an 
umbrella when it looks like rain to avoid the punishment 
of getting wet, and to keep your hand away from a hot 
iron to avoid the punishment of a burn.
