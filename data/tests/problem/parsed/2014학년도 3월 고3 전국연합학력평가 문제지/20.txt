Most people get trapped in their optimistic biases, so they 
tend to listen to positive feedback and ignore negative 
feedback. Although this may help them come across as 
confident to others, in any area of competence (e.g., 
education, business, sports or performing arts) achievement 
is 10% performance and 90% preparation. Thus, the more 
aware you are of your weaknesses, the better prepared you 
will be. Low self-confidence may turn you into a pessimist, 
but when pessimism teams up with ambition it often 
produces outstanding performance. To be the very best at 
anything, you will need to be your harshest critic, and that 
is almost impossible when your starting point is high 
self-confidence. Exceptional achievers always experience 
low levels of confidence and self-confidence, but they train 
hard and practice continually until they reach an acceptable 
level of competence.
