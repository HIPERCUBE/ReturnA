Our essentially subtropical body isn’t well suited to life in 
the Arctic because we don’t have the fur of polar bears or 
the thick, insulating fat of sea mammals. But we can make 
fur clothing, shelters to contain warmth, and weapons with 
which to hunt and defend ourselves. These items are good 
examples of cultural adaptation, which show how culture is 
used to survive the natural world. Keep in mind, though, 
that people must also survive the cultural world they inhabit, 
and that is just as important. For example, if you don’t 
greet your neighbors the right way, you may cause bad 
feelings; in the same way, your grandfather may not 
appreciate your elaborate, back-slapping handshake the way 
your buddy does. So although culture does help you survive 
the natural world, it also tells you how to survive the 
cultural world of social interactions.
