Plants generate hundreds of compounds that they use 
to protect themselves from being overconsumed by 
insects and animals. While some plants use these 
compounds to reduce all foraging, most plants tolerate, or 
even enjoy, about an 18 percent foraging rate (10 to 25 
percent depending on the plant) before they begin to 
initiate high levels of protective compounds. Many of the 
actions of animals when they eat plants (termed 
“herbivory”) are necessary for both plant and ecosystem 
health. Herbivory alters the density, composition, and 
health of plant communities through eating plants, 
dispersing seeds, and defecation. Some plants produce an 
initial series of leaves designed to be eaten, and more 
luxurious growth only occurs once that has happened. For 
many plants, metabolism and respiration are all stimulated 
by animal and insect feeding. It is only after foraging 
rises above a certain level that many plant defensive 
compounds are produced in quantity or come into play.
