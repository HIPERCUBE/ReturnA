32. 다음 글에 드러난 Hogan의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Hogan had already been walking for hours along the sand 
track. He had drunk the last remaining drop of water an 
hour before. His feet came down regularly one in front of

side of the track. Nothing was left but the dazzling sand 
with its millions of tiny broken grains, and dry stones that 
crumbled away in layers. No trucks passed. No aircraft ever 
appeared in the immense sky. The nothingness was so great 
that it could not even be called solitude any longer. It was 
like floating on the ocean, thousands of miles from land, 
while tiny waves sweep forward in ripples.
