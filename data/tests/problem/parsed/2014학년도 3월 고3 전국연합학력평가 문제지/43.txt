[44 ∼ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. 
In the mid-1970s some scientists observed employees 
of two manufacturing plants in the United States. One 
plant was located in a large metropolitan area, the other 
in a rural community with a population of three 
thousand. On average, the employees had worked at their 
respective plants for twenty years. Sadly, both plants 
were scheduled to shut down, and all workers were 
about to lose their jobs. 
For months, the men came to work knowing that in 
only a few weeks they would be unemployed. 
Anticipating the loss of their workplace was stressful. 
The anxiety was triggered to a large extent by the 
uncertainty of what lay ahead. How would they cope 
with unemployment? Would they find another job?
Scientists who followed these workers found that the 
employees experienced more days of illness before the 
plants were shut than during the weeks of unemployment 
that followed. The anxiety induced by anticipating the 
loss of their jobs damaged their health and well-being. 
Ironically, once unemployed, the workers became 
healthier. It’s because the uncertainty of how life would 
be without a job was            . Anxiety was reduced, 
and attention turned to finding a new job, rather than 
worrying aimlessly about what might be.
