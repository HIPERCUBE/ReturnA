Dear C&G Waste Services, 
Westwood High School is currently establishing a paper 
recycling program. With the help of students and staff, 
we aim to significantly reduce the amount of paper that 
goes into the trash by recycling paper. We currently have 
a dumpster that will hold the paper recycling, but we 
need containers for individual classrooms to meet our 
goal. We would like to request 20 containers. We also 
need 2,000 clear trash bags in order to allow students 
and staff to get the paper to the recycle dumpster. So, 
we are asking your company if it will donate these items 
so that we may succeed in conserving our natural 
resources. Please contact me if you have any questions. 
We look forward to establishing a partnership with C&G 
Waste Services. We know that these types of 
partnerships help us give back to the community and 
enhance actions our students can take towards helping 
the environment.
Sincerely,
Anna Wilson

Mr. Aryeh noticed a young boy coming to school in old 
worn-out shoes. Clearly ① he needed a new pair, but Mr. 
Aryeh also knew that the boy’s father, a proud man, would 
be humiliated and offended if ② his son were treated as a 
charity case and given a pair. How does a person with moral 
imagination provide a boy with shoes, while not paining his 
father’s soul? During a morning recess break, Mr. Aryeh 
called the boy to his office because, he said, he needed to 
test ③ him on his English proficiency. He asked the boy 
several questions, well within the youth’s grasp. “Wonderful!” 
Mr. Aryeh said when the boy answered correctly. He gave 
④ the youngster two notes: one to be brought to a local 
shoemaker, with instructions to give the boy a good pair of 
shoes, for which Mr. Aryeh would pay; the second, a note 
to the boy’s father telling ⑤ him about the “prize” his son 
had won.

Most people get trapped in their optimistic biases, so they 
tend to listen to positive feedback and ignore negative 
feedback. Although this may help them come across as 
confident to others, in any area of competence (e.g., 
education, business, sports or performing arts) achievement 
is 10% performance and 90% preparation. Thus, the more 
aware you are of your weaknesses, the better prepared you 
will be. Low self-confidence may turn you into a pessimist, 
but when pessimism teams up with ambition it often 
produces outstanding performance. To be the very best at 
anything, you will need to be your harshest critic, and that 
is almost impossible when your starting point is high 
self-confidence. Exceptional achievers always experience 
low levels of confidence and self-confidence, but they train 
hard and practice continually until they reach an acceptable 
level of competence. 
① Never Reveal Your Weaknesses
② Negative Comments Are Harmful
③ The Risk of Ambition Without Effort
④ The Less Confident Are More Successful
⑤ High Self-Confidence Leads to Better Achievement
21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? 
A painter I know can’t do anything in her studio without 
rock’n’roll pounding out of the speakers. Turning it on turns 
on a switch inside her. The beat gets her going. It’s the 
metronome for her creative life. A writer friend can only 
write outside. He can’t stand the thought of being tied 
indoors to his word processor while a “great day” is 
unfolding outside. So he carries his coffee mug out to work 
in the warmth of an open porch in his backyard. Mystically, 
he now believes he is missing nothing. In the end, there is 
no one ideal condition for creativity. What works for one 
person is useless for another. The only criterion is this: 
Make it easy on yourself. Find a working environment where 
the prospect of wrestling with your muse doesn’t scare you, 
doesn’t shut you down. It should make you want to be 
there, and once you find it, stick with it.
* muse: (예술적) 영감을 주는 신
① 집중적인 노력은 창의력 향상의 바탕이 된다.
② 음악 감상을 통해 창조적 영감을 얻을 수 있다.
③ 창작 활동을 위해 일과 휴식의 균형이 필요하다.
④ 창조적 활동을 위한 각자에게 맞는 작업 환경이 있다.
⑤ 창조적 영감은 예상치 않은 순간에 떠오르기도 한다.

Our essentially subtropical body isn’t well suited to life in 
the Arctic because we don’t have the fur of polar bears or 
the thick, insulating fat of sea mammals. But we can make 
fur clothing, shelters to contain warmth, and weapons with 
which to hunt and defend ourselves. These items are good 
examples of cultural adaptation, which show how culture is 
used to survive the natural world. Keep in mind, though, 
that people must also survive the cultural world they inhabit, 
and that is just as important. For example, if you don’t 
greet your neighbors the right way, you may cause bad 
feelings; in the same way, your grandfather may not 
appreciate your elaborate, back-slapping handshake the way 
your buddy does. So although culture does help you survive 
the natural world, it also tells you how to survive the 
cultural world of social interactions.
① ways to improve biological adaptation
② the use of culture for human survival
③ genetic factors to reduce human adaptability
④ the influence of instruction on human survival
⑤ the role of communication in social interactions
23. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적
절한 것은?
When discussing the animal kingdom, each creature belongs 
to a species scale of generalists to specialists. Specialist 
creatures like the koala bear can only survive on an 
extremely (A) limited / variable  set of conditions: diet 
(eucalyptus), climate (warm), environment (trees). 
Generalists, on the other hand (think mice), are able to 
survive just about anywhere. They can (B) dread / withstand  
heat and cold, eat your organic breakfast cereal or seeds 
and berries in the wild. So, specialist species thrive only 
when conditions are perfect. They serve a very specific 
purpose within their particular ecosystem and are good at 
navigating it. However, should those conditions change — as a 
result of nature or, more commonly, an outside force —
specialist species often become (C) extinct / widespread . In 
contrast, mice can move from spot to spot on the globe, 
adapt to different cultures, diets and weather systems. And 
most importantly, they stay alive.
(A) (B) (C)
① limited dread extinct
② limited withstand widespread
③ limited withstand extinct
④ variable withstand widespread
⑤ variable dread widespread

In the 1970s, when schools began allowing students to use 
portable calculators, many parents ① objected. They worried 
that a reliance on the machines would weaken their children’s 
grasp of mathematical concepts. The fears, subsequent 
studies showed, were largely ② unneeded. No longer forced 
to spend a lot of time on routine calculations, many students 
gained a deeper understanding of the principles underlying 
their exercises. Today, the story of the calculator is often 
used to support the argument that our growing dependence 
on online databases is ③ disadvantageous. In freeing us from 
the work of remembering, it’s said, the Web allows us to 
devote more time to creative thought. The pocket calculator 
④ relieved the pressure on our working memory, letting us 
use that critical short-term store for more abstract 
reasoning. The calculator, a powerful but highly specialized 
tool, turned out to be an ⑤ aid to our working memory. 
25. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
I remember one of the smartest I.T. executives ①for whom 
I ever worked strongly resisting the movement to measure 
programmer productivity that was popular at the time. He was 
fond of saying that the biggest problem with managing 
computer programmers is that you can never tell ②whether 
they are working by looking at them. Picture two programmers 
working side by side. One is leaning back in his chair with his 
eyes ③closed and his feet on the desk. The other is working 
hard, typing code into his computer. The one with his feet up 
could be thinking, and the other one may be too busy typing 
④ to give it enough thought. In the end, the busy typist could 
well produce ten times as many lines of code as the thinker, 
which contain twice as many new problems as the thinker’s. 
Unfortunately, most of the productivity measurement schemes 
I have encountered ⑤measuring effort or apparent activity. 
They would reward him and punish his thoughtful neighbor.
26. San Miniato에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
San Miniato is a town of about 26,000 that sits atop three 
hills in the Arno river valley in Tuscany, Italy. The town’s 
history is deeply rooted in its function as an important stop 
along the trading route between France and Italy. To protect 
its historic building character, the city has set detailed 
criteria for the installation of signs, plaques, and posters and 
has revised its street signs. To protect views of the town 
and to limit visual intrusions, the city has made strict 
regulations about the construction of cell phone towers. To 
accommodate visitors and tourists and not intrude on the 
urban layout and design, the town has built an underground 
parking lot with an elevator to the city center.

They have not, however, always been considered places 
of beauty.
Forests have always had a role in human society. ( ① ) 
They have been a source of building timber and firewood, of 
wild game and foods like mushrooms. ( ② ) During the 
Middle Ages, especially in parts of Northern Europe, they 
developed a reputation for being places of darkness and fear, 
the home of evil spirits and wild beasts. ( ③ ) In Germany 
you might have been attacked by werewolves or a 
semi-human Wild Man, a kind of ogre covered with coarse 
hair who ate children. ( ④ ) Anglo-Saxon folk tales, such 
as the eighth-century Beowulf, frequently set the action in 
scary forests, a legacy inherited by the stories of Tolkien, 
in which friendly hobbits are extremely frightened at the 
thought of having to pass through the haunted Fangorn 
Forest. ( ⑤ ) Out of this medieval vision comes our word 
‘savage’, derived from silva, meaning a wood.

Fascinated by how easily fish slip through water, scientists 
and sportswear designers alike have examined fish skins at 
the molecular level to determine why they have less friction 
than humans. ① Researchers were surprised to discover that 
shark skin, which is rough enough to be used as sandpaper 
when dried, is one of the animal skins with the least 
friction. ② Shark skin is covered by small, V-shaped bumps, 
made from the same material as the sharks’ teeth. ③ Shark 
fin is also incorrectly perceived by some as having high 
nutritional value, as well as cancer-fighting abilities. ④ The 
rough surface actually reduces drag as the shark glides 
through the ocean, because the bumps efficiently channel the 
water away from the surface. ⑤ Copied in fabric form, a 
shark skin-like system woven into a textile’s structure 
gives the fabric a hydrodynamic advantage.

The Trend of Blood Donation in Korea: 2005 - 2009
The graph above shows the trend of blood donation in 
Korea from 2005 to 2009, in terms of the number of blood 
donors and blood donation rates. ① The blood donation rate 
was 5.3% in 2009, which was the highest during the given 
period. ② The blood donation rate was the same both in 
2005 and in 2006, and it showed constant increase 
afterward. ③ The number of group blood donors was the 
highest in 2005, and the number of individual blood donors 
was the highest in 2009. ④ The year 2005 was the only 
year when the number of group blood donors was larger 
than that of individual blood donors. ⑤ The difference 
between the number of group donors and that of individual 
donors was the largest in 2009.

Gabe Gabrielson has a nine-year-old son named Colin. 
Like many nine-year-olds, Colin frequently finds 
himself in disagreement with parental policies.  
(A) After a few debates that left both of them feeling 
frustrated, Gabe decided to change strategy, and 
announced, “Okay, Colin, we’ll try it your way for three 
days. But if you’re late for school any of those days, 
then we go back to the old system.” 
(B) For example, he protested Gabe’s policy that he get 
fully dressed before coming down to breakfast. Gabe 
didn’t particularly care what Colin wore at the breakfast 
table, but he worried that if Colin didn’t dress first, 
he’d wind up late for school. “But I’m more comfortable 
in my pajamas!” Colin argued. 
(C) Colin, amazed by the change in response, aced the trial 
run. He wore his pajamas and stayed punctual. As a 
result, the new practice stuck, and both sides are 
happier with the outcome.

32. 다음 글에 드러난 Hogan의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Hogan had already been walking for hours along the sand 
track. He had drunk the last remaining drop of water an 
hour before. His feet came down regularly one in front of 
the other, sending up little clouds of dust. The dunes 
stretched as far as the eye could see, motionless, on either 
side of the track. Nothing was left but the dazzling sand 
with its millions of tiny broken grains, and dry stones that 
crumbled away in layers. No trucks passed. No aircraft ever 
appeared in the immense sky. The nothingness was so great 
that it could not even be called solitude any longer. It was 
like floating on the ocean, thousands of miles from land, 
while tiny waves sweep forward in ripples.
① satisfied and grateful ② relaxed and refreshed
③ hopeless and abandoned ④ excited and anticipating
⑤ ashamed and embarrassed

33. Languages evolve differences because different groups of 
people independently develop different words and different 
pronunciations over the course of time. But the question 
remains why those diverged languages don’t merge again 
when formerly separated people spread out and re-contact 
each other at speech boundaries. For instance, at the modern 
boundary between Germany and Poland, there are Polish 
villages near German villages, but the villagers still speak a 
local variety of either German or of Polish, rather than a 
mix of German and Polish. Why is that so? Probably the 
main disadvantage of speaking a mixed language involves a 
basic function of human language: as soon as you start to 
speak to someone else, your language serves as an instantly 
recognizable badge of your                       . It’s much 
easier for wartime spies to wear the enemy’s uniform than 
to imitate convincingly the enemy’s language and 
pronunciation. People who speak your language are your 
people, whereas someone speaking a different language is 
apt to be regarded as a potentially dangerous stranger. 
① artistic taste
② group identity
③ intellectual power
④ personal character
⑤ educational background
34. Our craving for                       is illustrated by a 
study of religious Israeli women, carried out by 
anthropologists Richard Sosis and W. Penn Handwerker. 
During the 2006 Lebanon War the town of Tzfat and its 
environs in the Galilee region of northern Israel were hit by 
dozens of rockets daily. Although siren warnings alerted 
Tzfat residents to protect their own lives by taking refuge 
in bomb shelters, they could do nothing to protect their 
houses. Realistically, that threat from the rockets was 
unpredictable and uncontrollable. Nevertheless, about 
two-thirds of the women interviewed by Sosis and 
Handwerker recited psalms every day to cope with the 
stress of the rocket attacks. When they were asked why 
they did so, a common reply was that they felt compelled 
“to do something” as opposed to doing nothing at all. 
Although reciting psalms does not actually deflect rockets, it 
did provide the women with a sense of control as they took 
action in their own way.                * deflect: 빗나가게 하다
① knowledge of the future
② relief from feeling helpless
③ exploring the unknown world
④ being accepted by our peers
⑤ freedom from social conventions
35. Risk management professionals look in the past for 
information on the so-called worst-case scenario and use it 
to estimate future risks ― this method is called “stress 
testing.” They take the worst historical recession, the worst 
war, or the worst point in unemployment as an exact estimate 
for the worst future outcome. But they never notice the 
following inconsistency: this so-called worst-case event, 
when it happened, exceeded the worst case at the time. I 
have called this mental defect the Lucretius problem, after the 
Latin poetic philosopher who wrote that the fool believes that 
the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest 
one he has observed. The same can be seen in the Fukushima 
nuclear reactor, which experienced a huge failure in 2011 
when a tsunami struck. It had been built to endure the worst 
past historical earthquake, with the builders not imagining 
much worse — and not thinking that the worst past event had 
to be a surprise, as it                                . [3점]
① had no precedent

36. Think of how you developed your style of using the 
brakes on your car. As you were mastering the skill of 
taking curves, you gradually learned when to let go of the 
accelerator and when and how hard to use the brakes. 
Curves differ, and the variability you experienced while 
learning ensures that you are now ready to brake at the 
right time and strength for any curve you encounter. The 
conditions for learning this skill are ideal, because you 
receive immediate and unambiguous feedback every time you 
go around a bend: the mild reward of a comfortable turn or 
the mild punishment of some difficulty in handling the car if 
you brake either too hard or not quite hard enough. The 
situations that face a harbor pilot maneuvering large ships 
are no less regular, but skill is much more difficult to 
acquire by sheer experience because of the long delay 
between actions and their noticeable outcomes. Whether 
professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise 
depends essentially on                              , as 
well as on sufficient opportunity to practice. [3점]
① the ability to control emotions
② the assistance from instructors
③ the discovery of hidden talents
④ the desire to beat the opponents
⑤ the quality and speed of feedback
37. The tight bonds we form with our tools go both ways. 
Even as our technologies become extensions of ourselves, 
we become extensions of our technologies. When the 
carpenter takes his hammer into his hand, he can use that 
hand to do only what a hammer can do. The hand becomes 
an implement for pounding and pulling nails. When the 
soldier puts the binoculars to his eyes, he can see only 
what the lenses allow him to see. His field of view 
lengthens, but he becomes blind to what’s nearby. 
Nietzsche’s experience with his typewriter provides a 
particularly good illustration of the way __________________. 
Not only did the philosopher come to imagine that his 
typewriter was “a thing like me”; he also sensed that he 
was becoming a thing like it, that his typewriter was 
shaping his thoughts. [3점]
① technologies exert their influence on us
② tools are refined and developed
③ we overcome our weaknesses
④ one invention builds on another
⑤ we put our passion into meaningful purposes

38. Indeed, confusing people a little bit is beneficial ― it is 
good for you and good for them. For example, imagine 
someone extremely punctual who comes home at exactly six 
o’clock every day for fifteen years. You can use his arrival 
to set your watch. The fellow will cause his family anxiety 
if he is barely a few minutes late. Someone with a slightly 
more    (A)    schedule, with, say, a half-hour variation, 
won’t do so. For similar reasons, stability is not good for the 
economy: firms become very weak during long periods of 
steady success without failure, and hidden vulnerabilities 
accumulate silently under the surface ― so delaying crises is 
not a very good idea. Likewise,    (B)    of ‘ups and downs’ 
in the market causes hidden risks to accumulate quietly. The 
longer one goes without a market trauma, the worse the 
damage when a real crisis occurs.

39. My suggestion is to understand and make use of the 
changes in people’s strengths and weaknesses as they grow 
older. We can say that useful attributes tending to decrease 
with age include ambition, desire to compete, physical 
strength and endurance, and capacity for sustained mental 
concentration.   (A)    , useful attributes tending to 
increase with age include experience of one’s field, 
understanding of people and relationships, and ability to help 
other people without one’s own ego getting in the way. 
These shifts in strengths result in many older workers 
choosing to devote more of their efforts to supervising, 
administering, advising, and teaching.   (B)    , my farmer 
friends in their 80s spend less time on horseback and on 
tractors, more time making strategic decisions about the 
business of farming; my older lawyer friends spend less 
time in court, more time mentoring younger lawyers.

② In other words Instead
③ Additionally In contrast
④ Conversely In contrast

Plants generate hundreds of compounds that they use 
to protect themselves from being overconsumed by 
insects and animals. While some plants use these 
compounds to reduce all foraging, most plants tolerate, or 
even enjoy, about an 18 percent foraging rate (10 to 25 
percent depending on the plant) before they begin to 
initiate high levels of protective compounds. Many of the 
actions of animals when they eat plants (termed 
“herbivory”) are necessary for both plant and ecosystem 
health. Herbivory alters the density, composition, and 
health of plant communities through eating plants, 
dispersing seeds, and defecation. Some plants produce an 
initial series of leaves designed to be eaten, and more 
luxurious growth only occurs once that has happened. For 
many plants, metabolism and respiration are all stimulated 
by animal and insect feeding. It is only after foraging 
rises above a certain level that many plant defensive 
compounds are produced in quantity or come into play.
