A painter I know can’t do anything in her studio without 
rock’n’roll pounding out of the speakers. Turning it on turns 
on a switch inside her. The beat gets her going. It’s the 
metronome for her creative life. A writer friend can only 
write outside. He can’t stand the thought of being tied 
indoors to his word processor while a “great day” is 
unfolding outside. So he carries his coffee mug out to work 
in the warmth of an open porch in his backyard. Mystically, 
he now believes he is missing nothing. In the end, there is 
no one ideal condition for creativity. What works for one 
person is useless for another. The only criterion is this: 
Make it easy on yourself. Find a working environment where 
the prospect of wrestling with your muse doesn’t scare you, 
doesn’t shut you down. It should make you want to be 
there, and once you find it, stick with it.
