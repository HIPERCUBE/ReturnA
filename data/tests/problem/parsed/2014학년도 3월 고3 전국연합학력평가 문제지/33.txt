33. Languages evolve differences because different groups of 
people independently develop different words and different 
pronunciations over the course of time. But the question 
remains why those diverged languages don’t merge again 
when formerly separated people spread out and re-contact 
each other at speech boundaries. For instance, at the modern 
boundary between Germany and Poland, there are Polish 
villages near German villages, but the villagers still speak a 
local variety of either German or of Polish, rather than a 
mix of German and Polish. Why is that so? Probably the 
main disadvantage of speaking a mixed language involves a 
basic function of human language: as soon as you start to 
speak to someone else, your language serves as an instantly 
recognizable badge of your                       . It’s much 
easier for wartime spies to wear the enemy’s uniform than 
to imitate convincingly the enemy’s language and 
pronunciation. People who speak your language are your 
people, whereas someone speaking a different language is 
apt to be regarded as a potentially dangerous stranger.
