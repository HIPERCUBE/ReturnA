36. Think of how you developed your style of using the 
brakes on your car. As you were mastering the skill of 
taking curves, you gradually learned when to let go of the 
accelerator and when and how hard to use the brakes. 
Curves differ, and the variability you experienced while 
learning ensures that you are now ready to brake at the 
right time and strength for any curve you encounter. The 
conditions for learning this skill are ideal, because you 
receive immediate and unambiguous feedback every time you 
go around a bend: the mild reward of a comfortable turn or 
the mild punishment of some difficulty in handling the car if 
you brake either too hard or not quite hard enough. The 
situations that face a harbor pilot maneuvering large ships 
are no less regular, but skill is much more difficult to 
acquire by sheer experience because of the long delay 
between actions and their noticeable outcomes. Whether 
professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise 
depends essentially on                              , as 
well as on sufficient opportunity to practice. [3점]
