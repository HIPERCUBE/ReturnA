Gabe Gabrielson has a nine-year-old son named Colin. 
Like many nine-year-olds, Colin frequently finds 
himself in disagreement with parental policies.  
(A) After a few debates that left both of them feeling 
frustrated, Gabe decided to change strategy, and 
announced, “Okay, Colin, we’ll try it your way for three 
days. But if you’re late for school any of those days, 
then we go back to the old system.” 
(B) For example, he protested Gabe’s policy that he get 
fully dressed before coming down to breakfast. Gabe 
didn’t particularly care what Colin wore at the breakfast 
table, but he worried that if Colin didn’t dress first, 
he’d wind up late for school. “But I’m more comfortable 
in my pajamas!” Colin argued. 
(C) Colin, amazed by the change in response, aced the trial 
run. He wore his pajamas and stayed punctual. As a 
result, the new practice stuck, and both sides are 
happier with the outcome.
