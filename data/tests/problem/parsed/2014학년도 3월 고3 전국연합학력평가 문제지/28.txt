Fascinated by how easily fish slip through water, scientists 
and sportswear designers alike have examined fish skins at 
the molecular level to determine why they have less friction 
than humans. ① Researchers were surprised to discover that 
shark skin, which is rough enough to be used as sandpaper 
when dried, is one of the animal skins with the least 
friction. ② Shark skin is covered by small, V-shaped bumps, 
made from the same material as the sharks’ teeth. ③ Shark 
fin is also incorrectly perceived by some as having high 
nutritional value, as well as cancer-fighting abilities. ④ The 
rough surface actually reduces drag as the shark glides 
through the ocean, because the bumps efficiently channel the 
water away from the surface. ⑤ Copied in fabric form, a 
shark skin-like system woven into a textile’s structure 
gives the fabric a hydrodynamic advantage.
