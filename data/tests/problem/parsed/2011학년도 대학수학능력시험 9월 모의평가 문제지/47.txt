(A)
My grandmother’s kitchen was overflowing with food. 
She raised her daughters to keep an extra box and bottle 
unopened in the cupboard for every bottle and box that was 
in use. Although she died before I was born, I was raised 
by her eldest daughter to do this same thing. Absentminded 
as I am, I often find I have accumulated two or even three 
extras of anything in my house.
