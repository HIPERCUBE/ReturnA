I was pleased to receive your letter requesting a letter of 
reference for a Future Leaders scholarship. As your physics 
teacher, I can certainly speak highly of your academic 
abilities. Your grades have consistently been A’s and B’s 
in my class. Since this is the first semester that I have had 
you in class, however, I do not feel that I am the right 
person to provide information on your leadership skills. I 
would encourage you to request a reference letter from 
those teachers with whom you have had the most 
opportunity to demonstrate those skills. I am sure many 
teachers would be willing to provide letters for you. Good 
luck with your scholarship.

There was a girl who grew flowers in New Jersey and 
sometimes took flowers to customers on Staten Island. To get 
there, ① she had to go over a bridge paying a toll of $2.50. 
One day, as she was approaching the toll booth, she saw a 
toll booth attendant who reminded ② her of her mother. As 
she reached in ③ her pocket, she found she had no money 
but a half dollar. Not knowing what to do, ④ she handed the 
coin to her and asked nervously, “Want to buy a fresh red 
rose?” The attendant looked surprised at first, but glancing 
at the cars piling up behind her, she took two dollars from 
her purse and rang it up on the cash register. “Yes, I’ll take 
it,” ⑤ she said with a smile. “And I suppose the price is two 
dollars even, right?”

The phrase, ‘jack-of-all-trades’ is a ① shortened version 
of ‘jack of all trades and master of none.’ It refers to those 
who ② claim to be proficient at countless tasks, but cannot 
perform a single one of them well. The phrase was first 
used in England at the start of the Industrial Revolution. A 
large number of efficiency experts set up shop in London, 
③ advertising themselves as knowledgeable about every 
type of new manufacturing process, trade, and business. For 
a substantial fee, they would impart their knowledge to their 
clients. But it soon became ④ evident that their knowledge 
was limited and of no practical value. Doubtful industrialists 
started calling these self-appointed experts ‘jacks of all 
trades and masters of none.’ These experts are still with us, 
and as a result so ⑤ does the phrase.

Mr. Potter was sailing for Europe on one of the greatest 
transatlantic ocean liners. When he went on board, he found 
(A) another / other passenger was to share the cabin with 
him. After going to see the accommodations, he came up to 
the purser’s desk and inquired (B) if / that he could leave 
his valuables in the ship’s safe. Mr. Potter explained that 
ordinarily he never availed  himself of that privilege, but he 
had been to his cabin and had met the man who was to 
occupy the other bed. Judging from his appearance, he 
was afraid that he might not be a very trustworthy person. 
The purser accepted the responsibility for the valuables and 
(C) remarking / remarked, “It’s all right. I’ll be very glad to 
take care of them for you. The other man has been up here 
and left his valuables for the same reason!”

22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Geothermal heat, generated inside the Earth, helps keep the 
temperature of the ground at a depth of several meters at a 
nearly constant temperature of about 10°C to 20°C. ① This 
constant temperature can be used to cool and heat buildings 
by using a heat pump. ② A heat pump contains a water-filled 
loop of pipe, which is buried to a depth where the temperature 
is nearly constant. ③ In summer, warm water from the 
building is pumped through the pipe down into the ground, 
since the underground temperature is lower than the air 
temperature. ④ However, far more use is made of geothermal 
energy for direct heat than any other source of energy. ⑤ The 
water cools and then is pumped back to the building where 
it absorbs more heat, and the cycle is repeated.
23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Comparing yourself with others is natural and can be 
motivational. However, too much of it leads to envy, 
especially if you’re ungenerous toward yourself. Instead, try 
measuring your present self against your past self. When I 
asked a salesperson to map his sales performance, he was 
amazed to see that he had achieved a 5% to 10% annual 
increase in sales while at his firm. This made him feel more 
self-confident and lessened his resentment toward his 
colleagues. If you feel threatened every time a perceived 
rival does well, remind yourself of your own strengths and 
successes. 
① 타인의 장점을 인정하자. 
② 결과보다는 과정에 충실하자.  
③ 타인을 통해 자신을 돌아보자. 
④ 자신의 능력과 장점에 초점을 맞추자.
⑤ 자신의 감정을 통제하는 능력을 기르자.
24. 다음 글에 드러난 Michael의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
Michael dared to look inside the window, but from the 
deep shadow of the trees and the gloom within, he could not 
clearly make out the objects within. Although every nerve in 
his body cautioned otherwise, he slowly pushed open the 
door. The door creaked as it swung back. As he carefully 
took a step inside, the door slammed shut. Michael’s futile 
attempts to open the door only increased his panic. He tried 
to calm his thundering heart by repeating to himself, “I am 
not afraid. I am not afraid,” but to no avail. He suddenly felt 
an uneasy darkness consume him from within. He opened 
his mouth to call for help, but his words failed him.
① sympathetic  ② weary ③ horrified
④ disappointed  ⑤ gloomy

25. Errors and failures typically corrupt all human designs. 
Indeed, the failure of a single component of your car’s engine 
could force you to call for a tow truck. Similarly, a tiny 
wiring error in your computer’s circuits can mean throwing 
the whole computer out. Natural systems are different, 
though. Throughout Earth’s history, an estimated 3 million 
to 100 million species have disappeared, which means that 
this year somewhere between three and a hundred species 
will vanish. However, such natural extinctions appear to 
cause little harm. Over millions of years the ecosystem has 
developed an amazing ___________ to errors and failures, 
surviving even such drastic events as the impact of the 
Yucatan meteorite, which killed tens of thousands of species.
* meteorite: 운석
① connection ② intolerance ③ insensitivity
④ accessibility ⑤ subjectivity
26. Unlike deviance in other settings, deviance in sports often 
involves ___________________ norms and expectations. 
For example, most North Americans see playing football as 
a positive activity. Young men are encouraged to ‘be all 
they can be’ as football players and to live by slogans such 
as “There is no ‘I’ in t-e-a-m.” They are encouraged to 
increase their weight and strength, so that they can play 
more effectively and contribute to the success of their 
teams. When young men go too far in their acceptance of 
expectations to become bigger and stronger, when they are 
so committed to playing football and improving their skills 
on the field that they use muscle-building drugs, they become 
deviant. This type of ‘overdoing-it-deviance’ is dangerous, 
but it is grounded in completely different social dynamics 
from the dynamics that occur in the ‘antisocial deviance’ 
enacted by alienated young people who reject commonly 
accepted rules and expectations.
① a disciplined control of the desire to avoid
② wasted efforts and resources in establishing
③ ambitious attempts to get independent of and free from
④ a traditional approach of matching slogans and mottos with
⑤ an unquestioned acceptance of and extreme conformity to
27. Time pressure leads to frustration, and when we are frustrated 
or experience other negative emotions, our thinking becomes 
narrower and less creative. However, people are unaware of 
this phenomenon and live under the illusion that when they 
are experiencing time pressure, they are also more creative. 
This explains why time pressure is pervasive and to some 
extent accounts for the increase in rates of depression. We are 
generally too busy trying to squeeze more and more activities 
into less and less time. Consequently, we fail to enjoy potential 
sources of happiness that may be all around us. To enjoy the 
richness that life has to offer, ________________________.
① we need to take our time
② we should maximize our opportunities
③ we have to deal with depression wisely
④ it is necessary to explore some creative ideas
⑤ it is important to embrace even negative emotions
28. With no attempt there can be no failure and with no 
failure no humiliation. So our self-esteem in this world 
depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do. 
It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed 
potentialities. Thus, ________________________________. 
This illustrates how every rise in our levels of expectation 
entails a rise in the dangers of humiliation. What we 
understand to be normal is critical in determining our chances 
of happiness. It also hints at two ways for raising our 
self-esteem. On the one hand, we may try to achieve more; 
and on the other, we may reduce the number of things we 
want to achieve. The advantages of the latter approach lie in 
the following statement: To give up pretensions is as blessed 
a relief as to get them gratified. [3점]
① the higher your expectations are, the more you will achieve
② self-esteem can be increased by lowering actualities
③ success divided by pretensions equals self-esteem
④ early failures in life may lead to happiness later in life
⑤ more supposed potentialities increase chances of happiness
29. For many people ‘nature’ is defined as a negative: It exists 
where people do not. Nature lies outside the urban and 
agricultural realms, in regions of Earth where natural 
processes are unhindered. Nature is where fallen logs rot and 
acorns grow, wildfires turn woodlands into meadows, and 
barrier islands shift with the currents― all without human 
interference. By extension, this definition suggests that nature 
is best protected by keeping humans far away, so that it can 
continue to run itself. But there is a serious problem with this 
view. If nature is defined as a landscape uninfluenced by 
humankind, then __________________________. Prehistoric 
peoples changed their surrounding ecosystems, whether by 
installing orchards in the Amazon or by hunting many large 
mammals to extinction in North America. And modern 
humans are changing the global environment even more 
profoundly, whether through planet-wide climate change, or 
by the worldwide movement of synthetic chemicals through 
the food chain.
① humans cannot exist without nature
② there is no nature on the planet at all
③ it deserves to be preserved at all costs
④ modern people owe much to their ancestors
⑤ humans are at the mercy of the forces of nature
30. The most obvious salient feature of moral agents is a 
capacity for rational thought. This is an uncontested necessary 
condition for any form of moral agency, since we all 
accept that people who are incapable of reasoned thought 
cannot be held morally responsible for their actions. 
However, if we move beyond this uncontroversial salient 
feature of moral agents, then the most salient feature of 
actual f lesh-and-blood (as opposed to ridiculously idealized) 
individual moral agents is surely the fact that every moral 
agent __________________________________ every moral 
problem situation. That is, there is no one-size-fits-all answer 
to the question “What are the basic ways in which moral 
agents wish to affect others?” Rather, moral agents wish to 
affect ‘others’ in different ways depending upon who these 
‘others’ are.
① brings multiple perspectives to bear on
② seeks an uncontroversial cure-all solution to
③ follows the inevitable fate of becoming idealized in
④ comes with prejudices when assessing the features of
⑤ sacrifices moral values to avoid being held responsible for
31. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 
적절한 것은?
When it comes to food choices, young people are 
particularly (A) vulnerable / immune to peer influences. A 
teenage girl may eat nothing but a lettuce salad for lunch, 
even though she will become hungry later, because that is 
what her friends are eating. A slim boy who hopes to make 
the wrestling team may routinely overload his plate with foods 
that are (B) dense / deficient in carbohydrates and proteins to 
‘bulk up’ like the wrestlers of his school. An overweight teen 
may eat (C) greedily / moderately while around his friends 
but then devour huge portions when alone. Few young 
people are completely free of food-related pressures from 
peers, whether or not these pressures are imposed intentionally.
* carbohydrate: 탄수화물
(A) (B)    (C)
① vulnerable …… dense …… greedily
② vulnerable …… dense …… moderately
③ vulnerable …… deficient …… greedily
④ immune …… deficient …… moderately

It is said that although people laugh in the same way, they 
don’t necessarily laugh at the same things. If this is true of a 
single community, it is even more true of people who live in 
different societies, because the topics that people find amusing, 
and the occasions that are regarded as ① appropriate for joking, 
can vary enormously from one society to the next. Some styles 
of humor with silly actions are guaranteed to raise a laugh 
everywhere. But because of their reliance on shared assumptions, 
most jokes travel very ②well. This is particularly ③ noticeable 
in the case of jokes that involve a play on words. They are 
difficult, and in some cases virtually ④ impossible to translate 
into other languages. Therefore, this is why people’s attempts 
to tell jokes to ⑤ foreigners are so often met with blank stares.
33. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
Many grocery stores give the shopper the option of paper 
or plastic grocery bags. Many people instinctively say that 
paper is less harmful to the environment― after all, paper is 
biodegradable and recyclable. (A) , most plastic is 
manufactured using oil by-products and natural gas. Plastic 
is not always easily or economically recyclable, and once 
manufactured, plastic may last virtually indefinitely. Yet in the 
United States, paper products are the single largest component 
of municipal waste. Even though paper products may 
theoretically be biodegradable, in most landfills, they do 
not biodegrade. (B) ,  paper production emits air 
pollution, specifically 70 percent more pollution than the 
production of plastic bags. And consider that making paper uses 
trees that could be absorbing carbon dioxide. The paper bag 
making process also results in three times more water pollutants 
than making plastic bags.
(A) (B)
① In contrast …… Furthermore
② In contrast …… However
③ As a result …… Likewise

34. While predictions about the future are always difficult, 
one can be made with certainty. People will find themselves 
in large numbers of interactions where intercultural 
communication skills will be essential. There are several 
reasons for such prediction. Some reasons include increasing 
amounts of contact brought on by overseas assignments in 
the business world, the movement of college students 
spending time in other countries, and increasing amounts of 
international travel among tourists. Others relate to social 
changes within any one large and complex nation: affirmative 
action, the movement of immigrants and refugees, bilingual 
education programs, and movement away from the goal that 
ethnic minorities become a part of a ‘melting pot.’ Therefore, 
it is essential that people research the cultures and 
communication conventions of those whom they propose to 
meet in the future.
* affirmative action: 소수민족 차별 철폐 조치
① predictions of social changes in other countries
② necessity of understanding intercultural communication
③ importance of good educators in a multicultural nation
④ limitations of communication conventions across cultures
⑤ methods of intercultural communication in the business world

35. A famous psychiatrist was leading a symposium on the 
methods of getting patients to open up about themselves. The 
psychiatrist challenged his colleagues with a boast: “I’ll bet 
that my technique will enable me to get a new patient to talk 
about the most private things during the first session without 
my having to ask a question.” What was his magic formula? 
Simply this: He began the session by revealing to the patient 
something personal about himself― secrets with which the 
patient might damage the doctor by breaking the confidence. 
As he was ‘maskless,’ patients began to talk about their lives. 
They opened themselves up to him because he had become 
an open-minded person himself, and openness evoked 
openness. The same principle applies to all human relationships. 
If you dare to take the initiative in self-revelation, the other 
person is much more likely to reveal secrets to you.
① being frank with patients with serious illness
② opening up oneself to draw out the other person
③ need of confidentiality between doctors and patients
④ effects of a new treatment on psychological problems
⑤ rebuilding broken relationships between close acquaintances

respondents with five prominent social media in 2007 and 
2008. ① According to the graph, the social media that was 
the most familiar in 2007 was blogging. ② In the following 
year, social networking became the most familiar social 
media. ③ Video blogging, which was the least familiar social 
media in 2007, showed the biggest increase in familiarity 
among the three media that showed an increase from 2007 
to 2008. ④ Wikis showed a bigger decrease in familiarity 
than podcasting from 2007 to 2008. ⑤ In 2008, podcasting 
and wikis were the least familiar social media.

During the early 1980s, a team of Italian scientists carried 
out a series of studies under a variety of circumstances on 
the ticklishness of people. The researchers found that 
people seem to have one foot that is more ticklish than the 
other― and for most people it is the right. The experiment 
was repeated in 1998 using a special way that a pointed 
nylon rod was stroked across the bottom of the foot three 
times at intervals of a second. After applying it to thirty-four 
people, the researchers confirmed the original finding and 
pushed back the frontiers of knowledge still further by 
showing that males were more ticklish than females. One 
suggested explanation is that the left side of the brain, 
which detects stimuli applied to the right foot, is associated 
with positive emotions such as laughter.

38. Buffon에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Buffon was a famous zoologist and botanist during the 
reign of the French monarch Louis ⅩⅥ. Buffon stocked the 
park at Versailles with wild animals. He also expanded the 
botanical garden on the Left Bank in Paris. And with the 
confidence that goes with being a great collector, he began 
writing a comprehensive natural history of the world. In 
that work, Buffon expressed the biased opinion that native 
animals of the New World are smaller than those of 
Europe, that there are fewer species of animals in America, 
and that even domesticated species of European animals 
diminished in size and vigor upon crossing the Atlantic. 
Obviously, his opinions were not well-received and were 
severely criticized in America.
① Louis ⅩⅥ가 통치할 때의 동물학자이자 식물학자였다.
② Paris의 Left Bank에 있는 식물원을 확장했다.
③ 세계 자연사에 관한 글을 집필하기 시작했다.
④ America의 동물 종(種)이 Europe보다 많다는 견해를 표명했다.
⑤ 그의 견해들은 America에서 비판을 받았다.

39. After an event, all one has are memories of it. Because 
most waits expect a desired outcome, it is the memory of the 
outcome that dominates, not the intermediate components. If 
the overall outcome is pleasurable enough, any unpleasantness 
suffered along the way is minimized. Terence Mitchell and 
Leigh Thompson call this ‘rosy retrospection.’ Mitchell and 
his colleagues studied participants in a 12-day tour of Europe, 
students going home for Thanksgiving vacation and a 
three-week bicycle tour across California. In all of these cases, 
the results were similar. Before an event, people looked 
forward with positive anticipation. Afterward, they remembered 
fondly. During? Well, reality seldom lives up to expectations, 
so plenty of things go wrong. As memory takes over, however, 
the unpleasantness fades and the good parts remain, perhaps 
to intensify, and even get amplified beyond reality.

① 여행과 축제는 인생을 풍요롭게 하는 촉매제이다.
② 현실을 도외시한 예측은 부정적인 결과를 초래한다.
③ 바람직한 결과를 기대하면 현실의 어려움은 최소화된다.
④ 결과가 좋으면 나쁜 기억은 최소화되고 좋은 기억은 강화된다.
⑤ 기쁨을 얻기 위해 겪는 고통은 미래를 위한 투자가 될 수 있다.
40. Every day, it seems, we learn of an apology from a 
prominent figure in response to an indiscretion of some sort. 
Those in the public eye have an unfortunate tendency to 
apologize only after they have been found with a hand in the 
cookie jar. When this happens, it is only natural for a 
skeptical public to wonder, “Are they apologizing for their 
conduct, or simply because they were caught?” To make 
matters worse, the wrongdoer will often use the passive voice 
in his or her apology: “Mistakes were made,” rather than, “I 
made a mistake.” It is more comfortable to use the passive 
voice here, but doing so relinquishes any sense of personal 
responsibility. It is a non-apology and is not very meaningful.

41. We can infer that there was prosperity in ancient Athens 
because this was a time that saw the planting of many olive 
trees. Since olive trees do not produce their fruits for about 
thirty years, their planting indicates that people were 
optimistic about the future. The growth in the export of olive 
oil also encouraged the development of pottery, in which the 
oil was transported. About 535 B.C. came the invention of 
red-figure vase painting. Now the whole surface of the vase 
was blackened, with figures picked out in the natural red. 
This allowed much more variety and realism. And the 
prosperity brought about by the international trade in olive 
oil spread to the peasants and it was their rituals, with choral 
song and mimic dancing, that formed the basis of early 
theater.

42. Until recently, it was generally assumed that the first 
humans took a northerly route to leave the African continent, 
walking into the Middle East and then spreading out from 
there. However, mtDNA analysis now suggests the exodus 
may have proceeded via a more southerly route. In 2005, an 
international team of researchers announced that an isolated 
group living in Malaysia appeared to be the descendants of 
humans who left Africa around 65,000 years ago. According 
to the researchers, climatic change underway at the time 
would have made a southerly route easier. The genetic 
evidence suggests perhaps as few as several hundred 
individuals went f irst to India, then Southeast Asia and 
Australasia. If correct, this would explain why humans 
appear to have reached Australia around 50,000 years ago, 
while the oldest human remains in Europe― a jawbone 
found in Romania― are only around 35,000 years old.

Even worse than reaching a conclusion with just a 
little evidence is the fallacy of reaching a conclusion 
without any evidence at all. Sometimes people mistake 
a separate event for a cause-and-effect relationship. 
(A) You therefore leap to the conclusion that the man in 
the black jacket has robbed the bank. However, such a 
leap tends to land far from the truth of the matter. You 
have absolutely no evidence― only a suspicion based 
on coincidence. This is a post hoc fallacy.
(B) They see that ‘A’ happened before ‘B’, so they 
mistakenly assume that ‘A’ caused ‘B’. This is an error 
known in logic as a post hoc fallacy.
(C) For example, suppose you see a man in a black jacket 
hurry into a bank. You notice that he is nervously 
carrying his briefcase, and a few moments later you 
hear a siren.

The clanhouse usually consists of a room adjoining 
the dwelling of the senior female member of the clan.
Hopi religion features a ritual calendar that includes a 
large number of annually required ceremonies. In most cases, 
each ceremony is ‘owned’ by the members of a certain clan. 
( ① ) Every clan represented in a village has a clanhouse 
in which the masks and other sacred items used in the 
ceremonies are kept when not in use. ( ② ) This woman is 
in charge of storing ritual equipment and of seeing to it 
that they are treated with the proper respect. ( ③ ) There 
is also a male head of each clan whose duties likewise are 
partly religious because he is in charge of the performance 
of ceremonies owned by his clan. ( ④ ) A male clan 
head passes his position down to either his younger brother 
or his sister’s son. ( ⑤ ) In this way, culturally important 
ritual knowledge is kept within the clan.

The information processing model emphasizes rational 
analysis for solving problems, with an emphasis on 
techniques for quickly arriving at a solution. Culturally, this 
orientation fits well with the kinds of mental attributes which 
are normally valued by contemporary Western societies. For 
example, Westerners tend to admire someone who is 
independent and quick-thinking. But these characteristics are 
not universally valued. Agricultural African societies, for 
example, valued looking at the problem in the context of the 
whole society, noting its impact on various features of life. 
In most situations, speed in arriving at a solution was not a 
vital issue. This is also found with the Cree and Ojibway in 
Canada. These groups historically lived in wilderness areas 
and faced many hardships; in these circumstances, they 
would rarely get a second chance at solving problems. 
Consequently, these Native people value taking time to 
reflect on a problem and mentally walk through possible 
solutions before any action is taken.

In modern Western societies, (A)  is highly 
valued in problem-solving, whereas it is viewed 
differently in some non-Western societies due to their 
(B) .

① speed …… religious beliefs

The other day an acquaintance of mine, a sociable and 
charming man, told me he had found himself unexpectedly 
‘alone’ in New York for an hour or two between appointments. 
He went to the Whitney Museum and spent the ‘empty’ 
time looking at things by himself. For him it proved to be 
a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that 
he could enjoy himself so much alone.
What had he been afraid of? I asked myself . That, 
suddenly alone, he would discover that he bored himself, 
or that there was, quite simply, no self there to meet? But 
having taken the first step into this new world, he is now 
about to begin a new adventure; he is about to be launched 
into his own inner space, space as immense, unexplored, 
and sometimes frightening as outer space to the astronaut. 
His every perception will come to him with a new freshness 
and, for a time, seem startlingly __________. For anyone 
who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes, 
for a moment or two, something of a genius. With another 
human being present vision becomes double vision, inevitably. 
We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or 
think of this, and what do I think of it? The original impact 
gets lost.
“Music I heard with you was more than music.” Exactly. 
And therefore music ‘itself’ can only be heard alone. Solitude 
is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor 
of every experience.

(A)
My grandmother’s kitchen was overflowing with food. 
She raised her daughters to keep an extra box and bottle 
unopened in the cupboard for every bottle and box that was 
in use. Although she died before I was born, I was raised 
by her eldest daughter to do this same thing. Absentminded 
as I am, I often find I have accumulated two or even three 
extras of anything in my house.

(B)
Befriending life is not always about having things your 
own way. Life is impermanent and full of broken eggs. But 
what is true of eggs is even more true of pain and loss and 
suffering. Certain things are too important to be wasted. 
When I was sixteen, just after the doctor came and informed 
me that I had a disease that no one knew how to cure, my 
mother had reminded me of this.
(C)
But this abundance did not mean that things were to be 
wasted. Everything was always used to the full. Even the 
tea bags were used twice. There is a family story told about 
my grandmother’s refrigerator. Her refrigerator was always 
full to the very edges and every shelf was put to use. 
Occasionally when someone, usually a child, opened it 
without sufficient caution, an egg would fall out and break 
on the kitchen floor. My grandmother’s response was always 
the same. She would look at the broken egg with satisfaction. 
“Aha,” she would say, “today we have a sponge cake!”
(D)
I had turned toward her in shock, but she did not cuddle 
or soothe. Instead she reached out and took me by the hand. 
“We will make a sponge cake,” she told me firmly. It has taken 
many years to find the recipe, the one that is my own, but 
I knew in that moment that this was what I needed to do.
* cuddle: 꼭 껴안다
