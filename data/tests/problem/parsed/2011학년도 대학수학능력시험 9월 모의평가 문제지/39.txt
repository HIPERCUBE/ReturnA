39. After an event, all one has are memories of it. Because 
most waits expect a desired outcome, it is the memory of the 
outcome that dominates, not the intermediate components. If 
the overall outcome is pleasurable enough, any unpleasantness 
suffered along the way is minimized. Terence Mitchell and 
Leigh Thompson call this ‘rosy retrospection.’ Mitchell and 
his colleagues studied participants in a 12-day tour of Europe, 
students going home for Thanksgiving vacation and a 
three-week bicycle tour across California. In all of these cases, 
the results were similar. Before an event, people looked 
forward with positive anticipation. Afterward, they remembered 
fondly. During? Well, reality seldom lives up to expectations, 
so plenty of things go wrong. As memory takes over, however, 
the unpleasantness fades and the good parts remain, perhaps 
to intensify, and even get amplified beyond reality.
