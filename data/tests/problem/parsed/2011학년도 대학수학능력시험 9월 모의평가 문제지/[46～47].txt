The other day an acquaintance of mine, a sociable and 
charming man, told me he had found himself unexpectedly 
‘alone’ in New York for an hour or two between appointments. 
He went to the Whitney Museum and spent the ‘empty’ 
time looking at things by himself. For him it proved to be 
a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that 
he could enjoy himself so much alone.
What had he been afraid of? I asked myself . That, 
suddenly alone, he would discover that he bored himself, 
or that there was, quite simply, no self there to meet? But 
having taken the first step into this new world, he is now 
about to begin a new adventure; he is about to be launched 
into his own inner space, space as immense, unexplored, 
and sometimes frightening as outer space to the astronaut. 
His every perception will come to him with a new freshness 
and, for a time, seem startlingly __________. For anyone 
who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes, 
for a moment or two, something of a genius. With another 
human being present vision becomes double vision, inevitably. 
We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or 
think of this, and what do I think of it? The original impact 
gets lost.
“Music I heard with you was more than music.” Exactly. 
And therefore music ‘itself’ can only be heard alone. Solitude 
is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor 
of every experience.
