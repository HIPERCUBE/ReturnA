The information processing model emphasizes rational 
analysis for solving problems, with an emphasis on 
techniques for quickly arriving at a solution. Culturally, this 
orientation fits well with the kinds of mental attributes which 
are normally valued by contemporary Western societies. For 
example, Westerners tend to admire someone who is 
independent and quick-thinking. But these characteristics are 
not universally valued. Agricultural African societies, for 
example, valued looking at the problem in the context of the 
whole society, noting its impact on various features of life. 
In most situations, speed in arriving at a solution was not a 
vital issue. This is also found with the Cree and Ojibway in 
Canada. These groups historically lived in wilderness areas 
and faced many hardships; in these circumstances, they 
would rarely get a second chance at solving problems. 
Consequently, these Native people value taking time to 
reflect on a problem and mentally walk through possible 
solutions before any action is taken.

In modern Western societies, (A)  is highly 
valued in problem-solving, whereas it is viewed 
differently in some non-Western societies due to their 
(B) .

① speed …… religious beliefs

The other day an acquaintance of mine, a sociable and 
charming man, told me he had found himself unexpectedly 
‘alone’ in New York for an hour or two between appointments. 
He went to the Whitney Museum and spent the ‘empty’ 
time looking at things by himself. For him it proved to be 
a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that 
he could enjoy himself so much alone.
What had he been afraid of? I asked myself . That, 
suddenly alone, he would discover that he bored himself, 
or that there was, quite simply, no self there to meet? But 
having taken the first step into this new world, he is now 
about to begin a new adventure; he is about to be launched 
into his own inner space, space as immense, unexplored, 
and sometimes frightening as outer space to the astronaut. 
His every perception will come to him with a new freshness 
and, for a time, seem startlingly __________. For anyone 
who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes, 
for a moment or two, something of a genius. With another 
human being present vision becomes double vision, inevitably. 
We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or 
think of this, and what do I think of it? The original impact 
gets lost.
“Music I heard with you was more than music.” Exactly. 
And therefore music ‘itself’ can only be heard alone. Solitude 
is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor 
of every experience.

[48～50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
My grandmother’s kitchen was overflowing with food. 
She raised her daughters to keep an extra box and bottle 
unopened in the cupboard for every bottle and box that was 
in use. Although she died before I was born, I was raised 
by her eldest daughter to do this same thing. Absentminded 
as I am, I often find I have accumulated two or even three 
extras of anything in my house.
(B)
Befriending life is not always about having things your 
own way. Life is impermanent and full of broken eggs. But 
what is true of eggs is even more true of pain and loss and 
suffering. Certain things are too important to be wasted. 
When I was sixteen, just after the doctor came and informed 
me that I had a disease that no one knew how to cure, my 
mother had reminded me of this.
(C)
But this abundance did not mean that things were to be 
wasted. Everything was always used to the full. Even the 
tea bags were used twice. There is a family story told about 
my grandmother’s refrigerator. Her refrigerator was always 
full to the very edges and every shelf was put to use. 
Occasionally when someone, usually a child, opened it 
without sufficient caution, an egg would fall out and break 
on the kitchen floor. My grandmother’s response was always 
the same. She would look at the broken egg with satisfaction. 
“Aha,” she would say, “today we have a sponge cake!”
(D)
I had turned toward her in shock, but she did not cuddle 
or soothe. Instead she reached out and took me by the hand. 
“We will make a sponge cake,” she told me firmly. It has taken 
many years to find the recipe, the one that is my own, but 
I knew in that moment that this was what I needed to do.
* cuddle: 꼭 껴안다
