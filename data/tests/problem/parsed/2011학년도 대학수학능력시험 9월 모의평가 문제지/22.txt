Geothermal heat, generated inside the Earth, helps keep the 
temperature of the ground at a depth of several meters at a 
nearly constant temperature of about 10°C to 20°C. ① This 
constant temperature can be used to cool and heat buildings 
by using a heat pump. ② A heat pump contains a water-filled 
loop of pipe, which is buried to a depth where the temperature 
is nearly constant. ③ In summer, warm water from the 
building is pumped through the pipe down into the ground, 
since the underground temperature is lower than the air 
temperature. ④ However, far more use is made of geothermal 
energy for direct heat than any other source of energy. ⑤ The 
water cools and then is pumped back to the building where 
it absorbs more heat, and the cycle is repeated.
