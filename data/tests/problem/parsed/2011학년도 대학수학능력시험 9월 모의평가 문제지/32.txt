It is said that although people laugh in the same way, they 
don’t necessarily laugh at the same things. If this is true of a 
single community, it is even more true of people who live in 
different societies, because the topics that people find amusing, 
and the occasions that are regarded as ① appropriate for joking, 
can vary enormously from one society to the next. Some styles 
of humor with silly actions are guaranteed to raise a laugh 
everywhere. But because of their reliance on shared assumptions, 
most jokes travel very ②well. This is particularly ③ noticeable 
in the case of jokes that involve a play on words. They are 
difficult, and in some cases virtually ④ impossible to translate 
into other languages. Therefore, this is why people’s attempts 
to tell jokes to ⑤ foreigners are so often met with blank stares.
