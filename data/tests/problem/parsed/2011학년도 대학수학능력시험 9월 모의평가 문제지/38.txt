38. Buffon에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Buffon was a famous zoologist and botanist during the 
reign of the French monarch Louis ⅩⅥ. Buffon stocked the 
park at Versailles with wild animals. He also expanded the 
botanical garden on the Left Bank in Paris. And with the 
confidence that goes with being a great collector, he began 
writing a comprehensive natural history of the world. In 
that work, Buffon expressed the biased opinion that native 
animals of the New World are smaller than those of 
Europe, that there are fewer species of animals in America, 
and that even domesticated species of European animals 
diminished in size and vigor upon crossing the Atlantic. 
Obviously, his opinions were not well-received and were 
severely criticized in America.
