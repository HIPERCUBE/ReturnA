40. Every day, it seems, we learn of an apology from a 
prominent figure in response to an indiscretion of some sort. 
Those in the public eye have an unfortunate tendency to 
apologize only after they have been found with a hand in the 
cookie jar. When this happens, it is only natural for a 
skeptical public to wonder, “Are they apologizing for their 
conduct, or simply because they were caught?” To make 
matters worse, the wrongdoer will often use the passive voice 
in his or her apology: “Mistakes were made,” rather than, “I 
made a mistake.” It is more comfortable to use the passive 
voice here, but doing so relinquishes any sense of personal 
responsibility. It is a non-apology and is not very meaningful.
