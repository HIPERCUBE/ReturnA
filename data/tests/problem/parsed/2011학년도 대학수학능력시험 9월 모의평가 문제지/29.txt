29. For many people ‘nature’ is defined as a negative: It exists 
where people do not. Nature lies outside the urban and 
agricultural realms, in regions of Earth where natural 
processes are unhindered. Nature is where fallen logs rot and 
acorns grow, wildfires turn woodlands into meadows, and 
barrier islands shift with the currents― all without human 
interference. By extension, this definition suggests that nature 
is best protected by keeping humans far away, so that it can 
continue to run itself. But there is a serious problem with this 
view. If nature is defined as a landscape uninfluenced by 
humankind, then __________________________. Prehistoric 
peoples changed their surrounding ecosystems, whether by 
installing orchards in the Amazon or by hunting many large 
mammals to extinction in North America. And modern 
humans are changing the global environment even more 
profoundly, whether through planet-wide climate change, or 
by the worldwide movement of synthetic chemicals through 
the food chain.
