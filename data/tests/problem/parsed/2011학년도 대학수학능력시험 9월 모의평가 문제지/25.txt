25. Errors and failures typically corrupt all human designs. 
Indeed, the failure of a single component of your car’s engine 
could force you to call for a tow truck. Similarly, a tiny 
wiring error in your computer’s circuits can mean throwing 
the whole computer out. Natural systems are different, 
though. Throughout Earth’s history, an estimated 3 million 
to 100 million species have disappeared, which means that 
this year somewhere between three and a hundred species 
will vanish. However, such natural extinctions appear to 
cause little harm. Over millions of years the ecosystem has 
developed an amazing ___________ to errors and failures, 
surviving even such drastic events as the impact of the 
Yucatan meteorite, which killed tens of thousands of species.
