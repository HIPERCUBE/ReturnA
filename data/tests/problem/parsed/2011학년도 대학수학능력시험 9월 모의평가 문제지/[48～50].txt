(A)
My grandmother’s kitchen was overflowing with food. 
She raised her daughters to keep an extra box and bottle 
unopened in the cupboard for every bottle and box that was 
in use. Although she died before I was born, I was raised 
by her eldest daughter to do this same thing. Absentminded 
as I am, I often find I have accumulated two or even three 
extras of anything in my house.
(B)
Befriending life is not always about having things your 
own way. Life is impermanent and full of broken eggs. But 
what is true of eggs is even more true of pain and loss and 
suffering. Certain things are too important to be wasted. 
When I was sixteen, just after the doctor came and informed 
me that I had a disease that no one knew how to cure, my 
mother had reminded me of this.
(C)
But this abundance did not mean that things were to be 
wasted. Everything was always used to the full. Even the 
tea bags were used twice. There is a family story told about 
my grandmother’s refrigerator. Her refrigerator was always 
full to the very edges and every shelf was put to use. 
Occasionally when someone, usually a child, opened it 
without sufficient caution, an egg would fall out and break 
on the kitchen floor. My grandmother’s response was always 
the same. She would look at the broken egg with satisfaction. 
“Aha,” she would say, “today we have a sponge cake!”
(D)
I had turned toward her in shock, but she did not cuddle 
or soothe. Instead she reached out and took me by the hand. 
“We will make a sponge cake,” she told me firmly. It has taken 
many years to find the recipe, the one that is my own, but 
I knew in that moment that this was what I needed to do.
* cuddle: 꼭 껴안다
