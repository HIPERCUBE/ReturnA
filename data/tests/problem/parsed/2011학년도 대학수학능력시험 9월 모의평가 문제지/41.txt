41. We can infer that there was prosperity in ancient Athens 
because this was a time that saw the planting of many olive 
trees. Since olive trees do not produce their fruits for about 
thirty years, their planting indicates that people were 
optimistic about the future. The growth in the export of olive 
oil also encouraged the development of pottery, in which the 
oil was transported. About 535 B.C. came the invention of 
red-figure vase painting. Now the whole surface of the vase 
was blackened, with figures picked out in the natural red. 
This allowed much more variety and realism. And the 
prosperity brought about by the international trade in olive 
oil spread to the peasants and it was their rituals, with choral 
song and mimic dancing, that formed the basis of early 
theater.
