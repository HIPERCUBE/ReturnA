Comparing yourself with others is natural and can be 
motivational. However, too much of it leads to envy, 
especially if you’re ungenerous toward yourself. Instead, try 
measuring your present self against your past self. When I 
asked a salesperson to map his sales performance, he was 
amazed to see that he had achieved a 5% to 10% annual 
increase in sales while at his firm. This made him feel more 
self-confident and lessened his resentment toward his 
colleagues. If you feel threatened every time a perceived 
rival does well, remind yourself of your own strengths and 
successes.
