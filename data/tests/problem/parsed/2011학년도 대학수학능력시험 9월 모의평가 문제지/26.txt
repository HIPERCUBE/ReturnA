26. Unlike deviance in other settings, deviance in sports often 
involves ___________________ norms and expectations. 
For example, most North Americans see playing football as 
a positive activity. Young men are encouraged to ‘be all 
they can be’ as football players and to live by slogans such 
as “There is no ‘I’ in t-e-a-m.” They are encouraged to 
increase their weight and strength, so that they can play 
more effectively and contribute to the success of their 
teams. When young men go too far in their acceptance of 
expectations to become bigger and stronger, when they are 
so committed to playing football and improving their skills 
on the field that they use muscle-building drugs, they become 
deviant. This type of ‘overdoing-it-deviance’ is dangerous, 
but it is grounded in completely different social dynamics 
from the dynamics that occur in the ‘antisocial deviance’ 
enacted by alienated young people who reject commonly 
accepted rules and expectations.
