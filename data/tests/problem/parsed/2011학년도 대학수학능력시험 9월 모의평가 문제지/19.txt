There was a girl who grew flowers in New Jersey and 
sometimes took flowers to customers on Staten Island. To get 
there, ① she had to go over a bridge paying a toll of $2.50. 
One day, as she was approaching the toll booth, she saw a 
toll booth attendant who reminded ② her of her mother. As 
she reached in ③ her pocket, she found she had no money 
but a half dollar. Not knowing what to do, ④ she handed the 
coin to her and asked nervously, “Want to buy a fresh red 
rose?” The attendant looked surprised at first, but glancing 
at the cars piling up behind her, she took two dollars from 
her purse and rang it up on the cash register. “Yes, I’ll take 
it,” ⑤ she said with a smile. “And I suppose the price is two 
dollars even, right?”
