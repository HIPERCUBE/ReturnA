24. 다음 글에 드러난 Michael의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
Michael dared to look inside the window, but from the 
deep shadow of the trees and the gloom within, he could not 
clearly make out the objects within. Although every nerve in 
his body cautioned otherwise, he slowly pushed open the 
door. The door creaked as it swung back. As he carefully 
took a step inside, the door slammed shut. Michael’s futile 
attempts to open the door only increased his panic. He tried 
to calm his thundering heart by repeating to himself, “I am 
not afraid. I am not afraid,” but to no avail. He suddenly felt 
an uneasy darkness consume him from within. He opened 
his mouth to call for help, but his words failed him.
