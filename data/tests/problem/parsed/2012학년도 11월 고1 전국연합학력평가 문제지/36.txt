36.  You may think you found the ultimate answer to career 
choices or maybe you’re as confused as ever. Regardless of the 
side you’re on, the best advice for navigating these important 
life choices is this:                                                           . 
As smart and dedicated as you may be, you just can’t predict 
the future. Some of the most successful professionals in any 
imaginable field could never ever have predicted what they 
actually do today. Why? Because when they were in high 
school, those jobs didn’t even exist. It was not too long ago 
that there were no such things as the Internet, cell phones, or 
any of the other new tools that are so critical to so many jobs 
today. Being open-minded increases future opportunities. [3점]
