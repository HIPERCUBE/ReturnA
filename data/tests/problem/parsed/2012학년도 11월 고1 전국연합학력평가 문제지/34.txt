34.  A funny thing happens to most of our stuff almost 
immediately after we buy it. What we paid for in the store and 
brought home was a treasure, a stylish dress, or the latest cell 
phone. But once it belongs to us and takes up space inside our 
home, the stuff starts                           . “Our houses are 
basically garbage processing centers,” said one cynical 
comedian. As soon as stuff enters our homes, it begins the 
transformation. We get something and it starts out prominently 
displayed, then gets moved onto a shelf, then stuffed in a 
closet, then thrown in a box in the garage and held there until 
it becomes garbage. I definitely think the words ‘garage’ and 
‘garbage’ must be related.
