35.  Scottish economist Adam Smith saw competitiveness as 
maximizing self-interest. However, today the most 
‘competitive people’ are replacing his philosophy with the 
thinking of the mathematician, John Nash. He proved 
mathematically the theory of Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau; when parties collaborate, the overall size of benefit 
almost always expands, so each party gets more than it could 
get alone. The typical example is that four hunters can catch 
only one rabbit each while acting alone, but they can catch a 
deer together. Today, smart competitors collaborate whenever 
they can. Research shows that almost 90 percent of the time, 
people in cooperative environments perform better than people 
in traditional, ‘competitive,’ win-lose environments. In other 
words,                                                                      . [3점]
