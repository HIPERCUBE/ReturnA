I disagree with recent attempts to get rid of the national 55 
mph speed limit. Two undeniable pieces of evidence have 
emerged since the adoption by all states of the uniform speed 
limit. First, traffic death rates have been greatly reduced. It is 
obvious that a collision at a lower speed is less likely to result 
in death or serious injury. Second, it has been proved that less 
fuel is consumed at low speeds than at high speeds. It is 
generally agreed that the less fuel we must import, the better. 
The life-saving and fuel-saving measure should remain the 
law of the land.
