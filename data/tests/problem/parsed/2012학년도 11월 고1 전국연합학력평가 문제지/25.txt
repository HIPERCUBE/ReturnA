A wide range of evidence shows that contact with nature 
enhances children’s education, personal and social skills, and 
health and wellbeing, leading to the development of responsible 
citizens. However, research also shows that the connections 
between children and nature are weaker now than in the past. 
Children are becoming disconnected from the natural 
environment. They are spending less and less time outdoors. In 
fact, the likelihood of children visiting any green space at all 
has halved in a generation. Children themselves say that 
outdoor space is one of the things that they need to feel good 
and do well.
