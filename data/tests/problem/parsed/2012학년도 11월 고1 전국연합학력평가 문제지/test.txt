I disagree with recent attempts to get rid of the national 55 
mph speed limit. Two undeniable pieces of evidence have 
emerged since the adoption by all states of the uniform speed 
limit. First, traffic death rates have been greatly reduced. It is 
obvious that a collision at a lower speed is less likely to result 
in death or serious injury. Second, it has been proved that less 
fuel is consumed at low speeds than at high speeds. It is 
generally agreed that the less fuel we must import, the better. 
The life-saving and fuel-saving measure should remain the 
law of the land.

24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
An American man accidentally drops some rubber onto a hot 
stove and discovers how to process rubber. An English 
scientist observes an apple fall from a tree and suddenly 
understands what keeps the moon and the planets in their orbit. 
These are examples of unexpected great discoveries. Yet none 
of these advances was the result of luck alone. The American 
man had experimented with rubber for years before the 
accident helped him discover his finding. The English scientist 
had been pondering the question of how the universe is held 
together long before the falling apple inspired him. The key is 
to keep working and take advantage of an unexpected 
occurrence.

A wide range of evidence shows that contact with nature 
enhances children’s education, personal and social skills, and 
health and wellbeing, leading to the development of responsible 
citizens. However, research also shows that the connections 
between children and nature are weaker now than in the past. 
Children are becoming disconnected from the natural 
environment. They are spending less and less time outdoors. In 
fact, the likelihood of children visiting any green space at all 
has halved in a generation. Children themselves say that 
outdoor space is one of the things that they need to feel good 
and do well.

26. 밑줄 친 he가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
One day, a professor rode in a boat driven by a fisherman. 
On the way he saw a rock in the sea and asked the fisherman 
if ① he knew the structure of that rock. The fisherman said 
that ② he didn’t. The professor said he had forgotten that the 
fisherman was illiterate. Later, the professor saw big fish 
jumping and asked, “Do you know that a whale is a mammal?” The 
fisherman didn’t know and ③ he said so. “Oh, you are just a 
fool,” the professor said. Then, a violent storm broke the boat 
and threw the two men apart. As the fisherman was 
accustomed to such events, ④ he swam to save the professor 
who could not swim. When the professor got on land, ⑤ he 
apologized to the fisherman for all the previous insults.
27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Reality TV programs are products, just like T-shirts or 
coffee, and consumers can’t seem to turn them off. But why do 
consumers keep ① watching them? This is one type of question
consumer behavior researchers are interested in answering. 
Researchers say ② that reality TV programs offer several 
benefits to consumers, including　satisfying their curiosity. “We 
all like to watch people in situations　 ③ which we ourselves 
might be pressured. We can feel what they are feeling but at a 
safe distance,” says Professor Kip Williams of Macquaric 
University. We also role-play with　ourselves in the context of 
the show, ④ imagining how we might react in a similar 
situation. This, researchers say, can teach us ⑤ to be 
self-improving.

것은? [3점]
For years it was believed that emergency workers should 
undergo a counseling process after traumatic events to 
debrief about their experiences. The idea was that this would 
① prevent mental health problems in the future. After the 
September 11 attacks in the U.S., counselors went to help 
rescue workers deal with the trauma of what they had seen 
and make them feel ② better afterward. But did it do any 
good? An extensive study shows that the debriefing process 
had ③ little benefit and might have even hurt by interrupting 
the normal healing process. People often distract 
themselves from thinking about ④ pleasant events right 
after they occur. This may be better than recalling the 
painful events. When people are ⑤ depressed, recalling their 
problems makes things worse.

29. 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The above graph shows the rank of popularity of girls’ flower 
names in the U.S. during the time period 1940 - 2009. ① The 
popularity of the flower names in the graph generally decreased 
from 1940 to 1970. ② Among the five names, Rose was ranked 
the highest in 1940 and the lowest in 2009. ③ The name Lily 
became popular again starting in 1970 and reached its highest 
rank in 2009. ④ In 1990, all the names but Violet were ranked 
higher than the 400th place. ⑤ The rank of Iris was lower than 
that of Daisy in 2000.
30. Obsorb에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Obsorb is a material comprised of active glass. It is intended 
to clean contamination that is in our waterways. It swells up 
like a sponge when dipped into water and absorbs pollutants 
from contaminated water. While it seems similar to sponges, it 
does not absorb water. This means it can absorb more 
pollutants. Once Obsorb is full of pollutants, it floats to the 
surface of the water and pollutants can be skimmed off. 
Afterward, it can be reused hundreds of times. In addition to 
having unusually helpful properties, Obsorb is cheap to use.
① 물에 들어가면 부풀어 오른다.
② 스펀지처럼 물을 흡수한다.

⑤ 사용하는 데 비용이 적게 든다.

31.  Children observe and learn from their parents’ purchasing 
behavior, even though parents may not always be aware of it. 
For example, a child sees the mother squeeze an orange 
slightly to check if it is fresh, and from this observation he or 
she learns how to tell whether a fruit is ripe. Similarly, a child 
observes how the mother reads through the newspapers, cuts 
the sales coupons, and presents them during a shopping trip. 
Thus, probably most of the consumer behavior patterns initially 
learned by children are              of those of their parents, 
particularly their mom.
① duties
② errors
③ copies
④ causes
⑤ necessities
32.  There is a well-known study conducted on Halloween. When 
trick-or-treaters rang the doorbell of the houses involved, a 
researcher told them that they could each take one piece of 
candy, and then he quickly left. Another researcher was secretly 
watching what happened. The results showed that 33.7 percent 
of the kids committed theft; they took more candy than they 
should have when they thought nobody was watching them. 
After that, the researchers set up a mirror right in front of the 
bowl of the candy, so the trick-or-treaters had to see 
themselves in it as they approached the bowl. The rate of those 
taking more than one piece of candy when the mirror was there? 
Only 8.9 percent. In this research, looking at the mirror led 
children                                                   . [3점]
① to reveal their inner anger

33.  Suppose your group has to find an answer for a problem. How 
can you come to the best idea? Some of the best, most innovative 
ideas follow some of the silliest suggestions. Even an ill-formed 
idea can spark a great idea in someone else. So don’t criticize 
anyone else’s idea until everyone runs out of ideas. Write them 
all down on a piece of paper, whiteboard, or blackboard. Look 
them over ―smart, foolish, contradictory or not. The best way 
to find a good idea is                                           . The more 
you can do this, the stronger an option will be. 
① to have a lot of ideas
② to focus on a specific area
③ to make use of visual aids
④ to catch up with new trends
⑤ to filter incoming information
34.  A funny thing happens to most of our stuff almost 
immediately after we buy it. What we paid for in the store and 
brought home was a treasure, a stylish dress, or the latest cell 
phone. But once it belongs to us and takes up space inside our 
home, the stuff starts                           . “Our houses are 
basically garbage processing centers,” said one cynical 
comedian. As soon as stuff enters our homes, it begins the 
transformation. We get something and it starts out prominently 
displayed, then gets moved onto a shelf, then stuffed in a 
closet, then thrown in a box in the garage and held there until 
it becomes garbage. I definitely think the words ‘garage’ and 
‘garbage’ must be related.
① losing value
② looking fresh
③ getting shared
④ grabbing attention
⑤ becoming unharmful
35.  Scottish economist Adam Smith saw competitiveness as 
maximizing self-interest. However, today the most 
‘competitive people’ are replacing his philosophy with the 
thinking of the mathematician, John Nash. He proved 
mathematically the theory of Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau; when parties collaborate, the overall size of benefit 
almost always expands, so each party gets more than it could 
get alone. The typical example is that four hunters can catch 
only one rabbit each while acting alone, but they can catch a 
deer together. Today, smart competitors collaborate whenever 
they can. Research shows that almost 90 percent of the time, 
people in cooperative environments perform better than people 
in traditional, ‘competitive,’ win-lose environments. In other 
words,                                                                      . [3점]
① collaboration produces better results
② overworking is a main cause of stress
③ cooperation doesn’t reduce working hours
④ competition is necessary in the market place
⑤ many jobs require the ability to work independently
36.  You may think you found the ultimate answer to career 
choices or maybe you’re as confused as ever. Regardless of the 
side you’re on, the best advice for navigating these important 
life choices is this:                                                           . 
As smart and dedicated as you may be, you just can’t predict 
the future. Some of the most successful professionals in any 
imaginable field could never ever have predicted what they 
actually do today. Why? Because when they were in high 
school, those jobs didn’t even exist. It was not too long ago 
that there were no such things as the Internet, cell phones, or 
any of the other new tools that are so critical to so many jobs 
today. Being open-minded increases future opportunities. [3점] 
① Focus on what you are good at
② Acknowledge your own limitations
③ Build your strength through regular practice
④ Set your ultimate life goal as soon as possible
⑤ Take a flexible attitude toward career choices

Managers who offer something very small but do so with 
courtesy show their employees more than just politeness.        
(A)     , employees would feel connected when they see 
their manager holding the door for an employee, or offering to 
carry a box if that employee’s hands are full. Although the 
physical act itself may be insignificant ―after all, how much 
energy is expended holding open a door? ― the psychic 
connection may be lasting. It draws the portrait of the boss as a 
human being who is tuned in to the needs of others.      (B)    , 
managers who perform acts of courtesy are not just being polite, 
but also setting an example that shows a lot about the necessity 
of treating people with respect.

③ In contrast …… Likewise

Throughout recent history, some artists were specially 
trained to paint in certain ways. They learned the popular 
styles of the day, and their work was accepted by the art 
world. 
(A) These people probably did not know other artists. The 
lives of academic painters are well documented in art 
books, but the lives of most folk painters are not 
documented. 
(B) Most folk paintings, on the other hand, were done by 
people who had little formal artistic training. They may 
not have known or cared about the ‘acceptable’ painting 
styles of the time. 
(C) This tradition is called academic painting. Not only did 
academic painters study with trained artists, but they were 
also part of the local art community. They showed their 
works at galleries, too.

But a pair of new technologies, the radio and the 
phonograph, drove the piano into a deep disfavor that 
continues to this day.
During the late 19th century, piano manufacturing was one 
of New York City’s largest industries. ( ① ) Most American 
families, it seemed, wanted to fill their homes with music. 
( ② ) The advent of the player piano, a music-making 
machine that required zero talent, drove the boom in piano 
sales further. ( ③ ) By the 1920s, the popularity of the piano 
caused around 300,000 pianos to be sold in the U.S. each year, 
roughly two-thirds of them player pianos. ( ④ ) In fact, 
Americans bought only 76,966 pianos last year, a decrease of 
75 percent over a period in which the population more than 
doubled. ( ⑤ ) People still love music, but most of them 
apparently don’t feel the need to make it for themselves.

People and animals eat basically the same food; the only 
difference is the way we prepare meals. But what makes 
us that special? Harvard professor, Richard Wrangham, 
thinks he knows the answer. He argues that heated foods 
are what allowed our ancestors to grow bigger brains and 
evolve into the intelligent creatures we are today. This 
means cooking was crucial to human evolution because it 
made digestion much more efficient, increasing the amount 
of energy our bodies derived from what we ate. He 
concludes that humans became better able to think, sing, 
paint on walls, and invent new tools. Ultimately, humans 
heating foods were more likely to survive, reproduce, and 
pass on cooking techniques to their offspring, along with 
the physical evolutionary changes, bigger brains.

Many of us turn our attention inward and reflect on 
ourselves to make our lives better. But we would do well to 
ask ourselves a simple question: Is it always helpful? 
To get a grasp of the matter, several psychologists 
conducted a study. The topic was whether analyzing the 
pluses and minuses of the relationship can be an answer to 
seeing how we feel about a special person in our life. People 
in one group were asked to list the reasons their relationship 
with a boyfriend or a girlfriend was going the way it was, 
and then rate how satisfied they were with the relationship. 
People in another group were simply asked to rate their 
satisfaction without any analysis; they just gave their 
intuitive reactions. 
It might seem that the people who analyzed the situation 
would be best at figuring out how they really felt, and that 
their satisfaction ratings would thus do the best job of 
predicting the outcome of their relationships. In fact, the 
result was                . It was the people in the intuitive 
group whose ratings predicted whether they were still dating 
their partner several months later. As for the people in the 
analytical group, their satisfaction ratings did not predict the 
outcome of their relationships at all. The result shows us 
that too much analysis can confuse people about how they 
really feel and that there are severe limits to what we can 
discover through overthinking.

[43~45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
Jack’s mentor Sid is a famous public speaker and 
best-selling author. When Jack was a graduate student at 
the University of Massachusetts, Sid was the most popular 
professor in the Department of Education. One of Sid’s 
highest priorities is (a) his health and fitness. 
(B)
Dessert that night was ice cream. Only one problem, though
― there wasn’t a full moon. To get (b) him to give himself 
permission on this special occasion, four people dressed as 
moon goddesses and entered the room carrying a huge full 
moon made out of cardboard and aluminum foil. But even 
with all of that loving persuasion, Sid stood firm on his 
commitment and refused the ice cream.
(C)
At 77 years old, Sid still bikes on a regular basis, takes 
supplements, eats healthy foods, and allows himself a bowl 
of ice cream on the one day a month when there’s a full 
moon. When Jack attended Sid’s seventy-fifth birthday 
celebration, over 100 of Sid’s family members, closest 
friends, and adoring former students came from all across 
the country to celebrate (c) his birthday. 
(D)
When Jack asked Sid the reason why he didn’t eat the ice 
cream, the professor told (d) him that he knew if he broke 
his commitment this one time, it would be that much easier 
to break it the next time he was offered ice cream. Sid 
knew that a 100% commitment is actually easier to keep, 
and (e) he was unwilling to ruin years of success for other 
people’s approval. Jack learned a lot about true self-control 
that night.
