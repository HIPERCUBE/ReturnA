Many of us turn our attention inward and reflect on 
ourselves to make our lives better. But we would do well to 
ask ourselves a simple question: Is it always helpful? 
To get a grasp of the matter, several psychologists 
conducted a study. The topic was whether analyzing the 
pluses and minuses of the relationship can be an answer to 
seeing how we feel about a special person in our life. People 
in one group were asked to list the reasons their relationship 
with a boyfriend or a girlfriend was going the way it was, 
and then rate how satisfied they were with the relationship. 
People in another group were simply asked to rate their 
satisfaction without any analysis; they just gave their 
intuitive reactions. 
It might seem that the people who analyzed the situation 
would be best at figuring out how they really felt, and that 
their satisfaction ratings would thus do the best job of 
predicting the outcome of their relationships. In fact, the 
result was                . It was the people in the intuitive 
group whose ratings predicted whether they were still dating 
their partner several months later. As for the people in the 
analytical group, their satisfaction ratings did not predict the 
outcome of their relationships at all. The result shows us 
that too much analysis can confuse people about how they 
really feel and that there are severe limits to what we can 
discover through overthinking.
