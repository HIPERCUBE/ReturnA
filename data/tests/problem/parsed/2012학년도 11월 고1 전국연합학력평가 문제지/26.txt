One day, a professor rode in a boat driven by a fisherman. 
On the way he saw a rock in the sea and asked the fisherman 
if ① he knew the structure of that rock. The fisherman said 
that ② he didn’t. The professor said he had forgotten that the 
fisherman was illiterate. Later, the professor saw big fish 
jumping and asked, “Do you know that a whale is a mammal?” The 
fisherman didn’t know and ③ he said so. “Oh, you are just a 
fool,” the professor said. Then, a violent storm broke the boat 
and threw the two men apart. As the fisherman was 
accustomed to such events, ④ he swam to save the professor 
who could not swim. When the professor got on land, ⑤ he 
apologized to the fisherman for all the previous insults.
