31.  Children observe and learn from their parents’ purchasing 
behavior, even though parents may not always be aware of it. 
For example, a child sees the mother squeeze an orange 
slightly to check if it is fresh, and from this observation he or 
she learns how to tell whether a fruit is ripe. Similarly, a child 
observes how the mother reads through the newspapers, cuts 
the sales coupons, and presents them during a shopping trip. 
Thus, probably most of the consumer behavior patterns initially 
learned by children are              of those of their parents, 
particularly their mom.
