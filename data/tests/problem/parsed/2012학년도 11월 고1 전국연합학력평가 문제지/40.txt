People and animals eat basically the same food; the only 
difference is the way we prepare meals. But what makes 
us that special? Harvard professor, Richard Wrangham, 
thinks he knows the answer. He argues that heated foods 
are what allowed our ancestors to grow bigger brains and 
evolve into the intelligent creatures we are today. This 
means cooking was crucial to human evolution because it 
made digestion much more efficient, increasing the amount 
of energy our bodies derived from what we ate. He 
concludes that humans became better able to think, sing, 
paint on walls, and invent new tools. Ultimately, humans 
heating foods were more likely to survive, reproduce, and 
pass on cooking techniques to their offspring, along with 
the physical evolutionary changes, bigger brains.
