Reality TV programs are products, just like T-shirts or 
coffee, and consumers can’t seem to turn them off. But why do 
consumers keep ① watching them? This is one type of question
consumer behavior researchers are interested in answering. 
Researchers say ② that reality TV programs offer several 
benefits to consumers, including　satisfying their curiosity. “We 
all like to watch people in situations　 ③ which we ourselves 
might be pressured. We can feel what they are feeling but at a 
safe distance,” says Professor Kip Williams of Macquaric 
University. We also role-play with　ourselves in the context of 
the show, ④ imagining how we might react in a similar 
situation. This, researchers say, can teach us ⑤ to be 
self-improving.
