For years it was believed that emergency workers should 
undergo a counseling process after traumatic events to 
debrief about their experiences. The idea was that this would 
① prevent mental health problems in the future. After the 
September 11 attacks in the U.S., counselors went to help 
rescue workers deal with the trauma of what they had seen 
and make them feel ② better afterward. But did it do any 
good? An extensive study shows that the debriefing process 
had ③ little benefit and might have even hurt by interrupting 
the normal healing process. People often distract 
themselves from thinking about ④ pleasant events right 
after they occur. This may be better than recalling the 
painful events. When people are ⑤ depressed, recalling their 
problems makes things worse.
