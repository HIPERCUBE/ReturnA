(A)
Jack’s mentor Sid is a famous public speaker and 
best-selling author. When Jack was a graduate student at 
the University of Massachusetts, Sid was the most popular 
professor in the Department of Education. One of Sid’s 
highest priorities is (a) his health and fitness. 
(B)
Dessert that night was ice cream. Only one problem, though
― there wasn’t a full moon. To get (b) him to give himself 
permission on this special occasion, four people dressed as 
moon goddesses and entered the room carrying a huge full 
moon made out of cardboard and aluminum foil. But even 
with all of that loving persuasion, Sid stood firm on his 
commitment and refused the ice cream.
(C)
At 77 years old, Sid still bikes on a regular basis, takes 
supplements, eats healthy foods, and allows himself a bowl 
of ice cream on the one day a month when there’s a full 
moon. When Jack attended Sid’s seventy-fifth birthday 
celebration, over 100 of Sid’s family members, closest 
friends, and adoring former students came from all across 
the country to celebrate (c) his birthday. 
(D)
When Jack asked Sid the reason why he didn’t eat the ice 
cream, the professor told (d) him that he knew if he broke 
his commitment this one time, it would be that much easier 
to break it the next time he was offered ice cream. Sid 
knew that a 100% commitment is actually easier to keep, 
and (e) he was unwilling to ruin years of success for other 
people’s approval. Jack learned a lot about true self-control 
that night.
