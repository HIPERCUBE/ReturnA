In each of the fairy tales, there’s a happily-ever-after. But
what happens when you get everything you’ve always wanted
and still aren’t happy? This is the question posed by the

A few years ago, while setting up camp deep in the rain

loudly in the distance. ①They thought the chimpanzees were

Dogs can tell ①what you like them or not. If you like them,
they like you back. In fact, they love you and will do anything

dislike people without giving　 them a chance. What is in our

best in everyone. Most people want to be good, fair, and liked.
Love others, and you will ⑤ be loved back.

(B) hit / hits it. More than a hundred years ago, a kind-hearted
man lived nearby. He thought that it was tragic for so many
sailors to die on that hidden rock. So he fastened a floating

It was upsetting to hear of your plan to freeze Social Security
benefits at their present level. When your administration
announced the plan to increase the benefits last year, we,
senior citizens, believed your promise. I can’t understand the
sudden change of your plan. I think the increases are quite
reasonable because my generation worked hard and paid taxes.
We also faithfully funded the Social Security system during our
working years. I urge you to follow your original plan from last
year.

24. A researcher reveals one of the secrets of happiness:
contagiousness. If someone I know well becomes happy, the
possibility of me becoming happy will increase by 15 percent.
If someone I know indirectly, like a friend of my friend or a
friend’s wife, is happy, it will increase by 10 percent. Instead
of having simply many friends, it is more helpful to have a few
happy friends. This doesn’t suggest that you should cut ties
with friends who often worry. Remember you are also the
source of the happiness of your friends. You can
happiness by wearing a bright smile on your face.
① buy ② forget ③ spread ④ disguise ⑤ measure
25. Exercise and diet are important, but they are not the only
keys to longevity. Meditating might also be important. Planting
a garden or playing games with friends might be calming and
relaxing. If those things bring you pleasure or make you
laugh, then do them. Longevity is a two-sided coin, with
quantity on one side and quality on the other. Just as no one
wants a great life that’s cut short early, no one wants a life
that’s long but not satisfying. We want to have it both ways:
.
① short and rich ② long and happy
③ fast and wealthy ④ famous and powerful
⑤ challenging and healthy
26. The citizens of Smalltown in America like seeing fireworks
on Independence Day. Each of the town’s 500 residents
believes the experience would be worth $10. The total value
becomes $5,000. Meanwhile, the city pays $1,000 for a
fireworks display. Because the value of $5,000 exceeds the
cost of $1,000, it is efficient for the city to have a fireworks
display. However, imagine that a private company decided to
put on a fireworks display. It would surely have trouble selling
tickets to the event because its potential customers could see
the fireworks even without a ticket. Because people would be
, the company would fail to
produce the efficient outcome. [3점]
① producers in charge of the event
② part-time employees of the city
③ sponsors for the fireworks display
④ lucky customers to get more tickets
⑤ free riders rather than ticket buyers
27. Dieters are often . Do you know
why? So who do you suppose is more likely to use a fork when
eating in a Chinese restaurant; a normal-weight person or an
obese person? The answer is the latter. We observed 100
normal-weight diners and 100 obese diners at Chinese buffets,
and we noted whether they were eating with chopsticks or
forks. Out of 33 people eating with chopsticks, 26 were normal
weight and only 7 were obese. Next time you are at a Chinese
restaurant, check out who’s eating with the chopsticks and
who’s eating with a fork.
① tempted to eat meat
② advised not to eat out
③ told to eat with chopsticks
④ required to avoid fatty food
⑤ encouraged not to skip meals
28. Marketers recognize that to capture the attention of
consumers they have to bring their messages to them in a
different way. To do so, many companies are turning to a
strategy known as buzz marketing, whereby consumers
themselves are asked to spread the messages. The goal of the
marketer is to find the influential consumers and push them
into talking up a particular brand of a product or service to
their friends. They become , telling
the brand messages to more people. Ultimately, the brand
benefits because an accepted member of the social circle will
always be far more credible than any advertisement.
① powerful carriers ② domestic producers
③ school inspectors ④ international supervisors
⑤ financial controllers
29. What is the quickest way for you to measure your
effectiveness at work? Maybe you have long-term measurements
in place, such as monthly or yearly goals. But what if you want
to know how you’re doing today? You could look at your to-do
list. You could also ask your boss. But maybe the best way
would be to see . That would
tell you if you were ahead or behind them. And if you were
behind other workers, you could try to figure out what you’re
doing wrong. It may not be the only way to measure your
effectiveness, but it certainly can provide a good reality check.
① how your bosses assess you
②what your needs and interests are
③ how specially you treat your friends
④why we get some unexpected results
⑤what others in your line of work are doing

I was driving when I saw the flash of a traffic camera. I
figured that my picture had been taken for speeding, even
though I knew I wasn’t speeding. Just to be sure, I went around
the block and passed the same spot, driving even more slowly.
But again the camera flashed. Thinking this was pretty funny, I
drove past even slower three more times, laughing as the
camera took pictures each time while I drove by it at a snail’s
pace. Two weeks later, I was at a loss to find that I had got
five tickets in the mail for driving without a seat belt.
① envious ② relieved ③ satisfied
④ indifferent ⑤ embarrassed
31. (A)~(C)에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말을바르게짝지은것은?
Many foot problems are due to poor-fitting shoes, including
narrow toes and high heels. No wonder women are more likely
to have foot problems! Make sure your shoes fit well and don’t
cause unnecessary (A) present / pressure . Avoid buying shoes

perfectly at 10:00 a.m. may seem too (B) tight / loose by 6:00
p.m. When trying on shoes, move your toes up and down to

32. 밑줄친부분중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?
If you are having a problem with your neighbor, don’t ① avoid
the neighbor and don’t call the police. It is ② unlikely that
either of those ways will work. Try handling the problem
yourself, remembering to use these strategies: Don’t ③ criticize
your neighbor’s behavior; instead, explain how the behavior is
affecting you. Rather than react ④ rationally, think about what
you want to say and then say it calmly. Be ready to
compromise. If these strategies are not ⑤ effective, the ideal
solution may be to ask another neighbor to help you solve the
problem.
33. 다음글의 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말을 바르게 짝지은것은?
In 1793, young Yale graduate Eli Whitney was journeying to a
teaching job in South Carolina when he was invited to the
plantation near Savannah. Whitney was disturbed by his
glimpse of slavery and the backbreaking demands of cotton
plantation life. He wanted to relieve some of the tiring work.
(A) , he built a cotton gin, a simple machine that
quickly and efficiently removed the seed from the cotton fiber.
In one hour, his gin processed the same amount that required
ten hours of slave labor. He submitted his patent, returned to
Connecticut, and began taking orders. (B) , his
innovative invention had a reverse effect. The gin required
more slaves as cotton culture expanded.

34. We all have courtesy in our hearts. All you have to do is
cultivate it. It’s a little like riding a bike: Once you learn, it
stays with you because the ability is natural. If you never get
on the bike, however, you will never make use of that innate
ability. It is often said that Latinos are friendly people. When
people come back from visiting Mexico or Latin America, they
always comment on the friendliness they experienced. I think
it’s more than friendliness. Latinos are courteous by nature and
by custom. This is something we must continue to teach our
children, and continue to pass on to everyone we meet.
① the outcome of reckless behaviors
② the significance of cultivating courtesy
③ the influence of good manners on the mind
④ the necessity of teaching cultural differences
⑤ the importance of being friendly to foreigners
35. Experts say that you only need 20 to 30 minutes of modest
physical activity three times a week to shape up your body.
You can do it easily and you don’t need to go to the gym.
Climbing the stairs instead of riding the escalator counts.
Briskly walking 10 minutes around the neighborhood, three
times a day, satisfies your daily exercise requirement.
Anything you do with pleasure that works up even a light
sweat is exercise. Remember, if an activity is easy to perform,
easy to fit into your schedule, and easy to love, you’re more
likely to stick with it.
① the difficulty of keeping in shape
② effects of exercise on schoolwork
③ the need for the effective exercise plan
④ easy ways to do exercise in our daily lives
⑤ tips for working out without hurting oneself
36. strawberry poison arrow frog에 대한 다음 글의 내용과일치하지
않는 것은?
The strawberry poison arrow frog is found in the rain forests
of Central America. It has bright red coloring that warns
predators that it is toxic. Frogs are not usually known for their
parenting skills, but strawberry poison arrow frog mothers go
to great lengths for their offspring. Once her tadpoles hatch on
the forest floor, the mother carries her offspring one by one
into the treetops. Her trips often take her 100 feet off the
ground. She places each tadpole into a pool of rain water that
gathers in a leaf. The mother returns to each pool every few
days to bring food. After three weeks, the tadpoles develop
into tiny frogs and leave the water for land.

Uppsala is the fourth largest city of Sweden. Lying 70 km
north of the capital city of Stockholm, this city has a population
of less than 150,000. The transportation system for the
travelers is developed quite well. Those who have the taste for
ancient architecture can visit the Uppsala castle, which has an
array of old paintings. Uppsala is the birthplace of Ingmar
Bergman, a famous director, who used this beautiful city as a
film setting. This attractive city invites you to participate in
the Uppsala Reggae Festival happening every year in the month
of March. Uppsala also gives you an adventurous experience with
its chilly climate and rugged landscape.

39. In almost every instance, the book as originally written is the
best. Simplifying great writing means less-than-great writing.
If you want to read Bambi, then read it as Felix Salten wrote it,
not the child-friendly popular version. If you want to know
Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends, it is best to meet them in
Alan Alexander Milne’s original story with Ernest Shepard’s
drawings. Most children are used to reading the classics
published as the popular versions, which often bear little
likeness to the original. It is not a good idea to buy weak
editions. Try to find the versions written by the original
authors.
①원작자가쓴책을읽는것이좋다.
②삽화가많은책을구입하는것이좋다.

40. Breathing is something you do without thinking, but it can be
consciously controlled. Correct breathing comes from the
deepest area of the lungs, and benefits both your body and
mind. But years of stress and poor lifestyle have left us with
shallow, rapid breathing, whereby we use only the top third of
our lungs. Learn to breathe properly and you will benefit from
a lower heart-rate, reduced blood pressure, and lower levels
of stress hormones. Plus breathing properly is essential when
you’re exercising. It will make you feel relaxed and keep you in
shape.

41. Have you ever noticed how a coin at the bottom of a
swimming pool seems to tremble? This occurs because the
water in the pool bends the path of light reflected from the
coin. Similarly, stars twinkle because their light has to pass
through several miles of Earth’s atmosphere before it reaches
the eye of an observer. It is as if we are looking at the
universe from the bottom of a swimming pool. Our atmosphere
is violent all the time. This disturbance acts like lenses and
prisms that shift a star’s light from side to side by tiny
amounts several times a second.

42. For half a century, from Picasso’s arrival in Paris in 1904 to
Henri Matisse’s death in 1954, the two artists were not only
rivals for the leadership of the international avant-garde but
also each other’s greatest critic and fan. They could foster
creativity through rivalry. Throughout history, there are many
other talented contemporaries― Verdi and Wagner, Tolstoy
and Dostoevsky, Gauguin and Van Gogh―who tested and
taught one another, pushing each other to experiment in ways
they might never have dared. Even if they were different in
many aspects, the competition through rivalry inspired greater
innovation.

After World War Ⅱ, the armies gathered up many hungry,
homeless children and placed them in large camps.
(A) The slice of bread produced amazing results. The children
would go to sleep, feeling they would have something to
eat tomorrow. That assurance gave the children a calm and
peaceful rest.
(B) In these camps the children were cared for and fed.
However, at night they did not sleep well. They seemed
restless and afraid. Finally, a psychologist found a solution.
(C) He gave each of them a slice of bread just before they
went to bed. If they wanted more to eat, more was
provided, but this particular slice was not to be eaten—
they just held it.

Other parents, however, insist that children do not learn a
work ethic this way.
How should parents introduce their kids to pocket money?
( ① ) Some parents link this with a set of chores to help their
kids understand that money is something they earn. ( ② ) A
mother of a child says that linking jobs, such as laying the table
and emptying the dishwasher, with pocket money is helpful.
( ③ ) She likes the fact that it makes her child familiar with
the notion of working for money. ( ④ ) Rather, they feel that it
makes children help parents not because they ought to but
because they want something. ( ⑤ ) Whatever your decision,
make clear why your children get pocket money and what it
means.

How do we know how a melody sounds when we are not
hearing it? We send information about the melody from our
memory to our auditory cortex. Then, we experience a
mental sound. Because “Happy Birthday” is sung only on
birthdays, it is not usually there when we want to listen to it.
If our ears do not feed the auditory cortex the information
about the song, we must get it from our memory. The
information sent from memory will allow us to have a fake
listen. Through this process, we are able to discover things
about the song even when we are not hearing it.

Our society is a youth-oriented culture, one that assumes
that what is new and current is of most value. Listening to
older people to find out how to live is not very common in
our society. Older people are often put into nursing homes or
live lives isolated from the young. We live in a society that
values youth above age. However, there is a reason why
human cultures, for thousands of years before our time,
respected the old. A lifespan of 75, give or take 20 years, is
not much time to learn what matters in our life by ourselves.
Years ago I met a boy in Brazil who told me that his best
friend was an elderly man on his street. This type of
friendship is a gift not valued by many young people in the
so-called developed world. As I look back on my life, I
always tried to learn from mistakes. I wish I had received
wise advice from those with more life experience than I had.
We desperately need elders in our lives, people who have
lived a long time and achieved .
