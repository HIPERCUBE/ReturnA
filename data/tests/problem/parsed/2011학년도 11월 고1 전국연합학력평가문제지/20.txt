Dogs can tell ①what you like them or not. If you like them,
they like you back. In fact, they love you and will do anything
that they can ② to please you. People react the same way. If
you do not like someone, chances are that they do not like
you ③ either. Sometimes we make impulse judgments and　
dislike people without giving　 them a chance. What is in our
hearts always shows. Keep your heart　④ open to accept the
best in everyone. Most people want to be good, fair, and liked.
Love others, and you will ⑤ be loved back.
