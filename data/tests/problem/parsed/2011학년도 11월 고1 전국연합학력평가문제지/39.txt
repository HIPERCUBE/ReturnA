If you want to read Bambi, then read it as Felix Salten wrote it,
not the child-friendly popular version. If you want to know
Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends, it is best to meet them in
Alan Alexander Milne’s original story with Ernest Shepard’s
drawings. Most children are used to reading the classics
published as the popular versions, which often bear little
likeness to the original. It is not a good idea to buy weak
editions. Try to find the versions written by the original
authors.
