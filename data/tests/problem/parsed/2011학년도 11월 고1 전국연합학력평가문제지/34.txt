34. We all have courtesy in our hearts. All you have to do is
cultivate it. It’s a little like riding a bike: Once you learn, it
stays with you because the ability is natural. If you never get
on the bike, however, you will never make use of that innate
ability. It is often said that Latinos are friendly people. When
people come back from visiting Mexico or Latin America, they
always comment on the friendliness they experienced. I think
it’s more than friendliness. Latinos are courteous by nature and
by custom. This is something we must continue to teach our
children, and continue to pass on to everyone we meet.
