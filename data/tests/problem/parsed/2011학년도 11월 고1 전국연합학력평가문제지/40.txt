40. Breathing is something you do without thinking, but it can be
consciously controlled. Correct breathing comes from the
deepest area of the lungs, and benefits both your body and
mind. But years of stress and poor lifestyle have left us with
shallow, rapid breathing, whereby we use only the top third of
our lungs. Learn to breathe properly and you will benefit from
a lower heart-rate, reduced blood pressure, and lower levels
of stress hormones. Plus breathing properly is essential when
you’re exercising. It will make you feel relaxed and keep you in
shape.
