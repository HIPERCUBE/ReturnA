It was upsetting to hear of your plan to freeze Social Security
benefits at their present level. When your administration
announced the plan to increase the benefits last year, we,
senior citizens, believed your promise. I can’t understand the

reasonable because my generation worked hard and paid taxes.
We also faithfully funded the Social Security system during our
working years. I urge you to follow your original plan from last
year.
