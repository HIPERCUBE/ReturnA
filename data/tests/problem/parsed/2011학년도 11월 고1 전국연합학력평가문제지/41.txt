41. Have you ever noticed how a coin at the bottom of a
swimming pool seems to tremble? This occurs because the
water in the pool bends the path of light reflected from the
coin. Similarly, stars twinkle because their light has to pass
through several miles of Earth’s atmosphere before it reaches
the eye of an observer. It is as if we are looking at the
universe from the bottom of a swimming pool. Our atmosphere
is violent all the time. This disturbance acts like lenses and
prisms that shift a star’s light from side to side by tiny
amounts several times a second.
