How do we know how a melody sounds when we are not
hearing it? We send information about the melody from our
memory to our auditory cortex. Then, we experience a
mental sound. Because “Happy Birthday” is sung only on
birthdays, it is not usually there when we want to listen to it.
If our ears do not feed the auditory cortex the information
about the song, we must get it from our memory. The
information sent from memory will allow us to have a fake
listen. Through this process, we are able to discover things
about the song even when we are not hearing it.
