How do we know how a melody sounds when we are not
hearing it? We send information about the melody from our
memory to our auditory cortex. Then, we experience a
mental sound. Because “Happy Birthday” is sung only on
birthdays, it is not usually there when we want to listen to it.
If our ears do not feed the auditory cortex the information
about the song, we must get it from our memory. The
information sent from memory will allow us to have a fake
listen. Through this process, we are able to discover things
about the song even when we are not hearing it.
*auditory cortex: 청각피질
When we are not hearing a song with our ears, the
information about the melody in our (A) is sent to
auditory cortex and we listen to (B) sound.
(A) (B)
① memory …… mental
② sight …… mechanical
③ voice …… mental
④ memory …… mechanical
⑤ sight …… vocal

Our society is a youth-oriented culture, one that assumes
that what is new and current is of most value. Listening to
older people to find out how to live is not very common in
our society. Older people are often put into nursing homes or
live lives isolated from the young. We live in a society that
values youth above age. However, there is a reason why
human cultures, for thousands of years before our time,
respected the old. A lifespan of 75, give or take 20 years, is
not much time to learn what matters in our life by ourselves.
Years ago I met a boy in Brazil who told me that his best
friend was an elderly man on his street. This type of
friendship is a gift not valued by many young people in the
so-called developed world. As I look back on my life, I
always tried to learn from mistakes. I wish I had received
wise advice from those with more life experience than I had.
We desperately need elders in our lives, people who have
lived a long time and achieved .
