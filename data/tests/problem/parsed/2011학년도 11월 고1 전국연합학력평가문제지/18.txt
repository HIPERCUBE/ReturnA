In each of the fairy tales, there’s a happily-ever-after. But
what happens when you get everything you’ve always wanted
and still aren’t happy? This is the question posed by the
award-winning musical, Into the Woods, which will be
presented by the Marquette High School drama club in
November. This musical looks at the nature of love and
parental relationships. It is also full of humor and fantastic
music. It will be performed at Kaufman Auditorium on
November 15th. You will be impressed by the performance of
fantastic high school students.
