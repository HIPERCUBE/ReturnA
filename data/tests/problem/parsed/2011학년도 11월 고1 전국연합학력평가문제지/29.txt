29. What is the quickest way for you to measure your
effectiveness at work? Maybe you have long-term measurements
in place, such as monthly or yearly goals. But what if you want
to know how you’re doing today? You could look at your to-do
list. You could also ask your boss. But maybe the best way
would be to see . That would
tell you if you were ahead or behind them. And if you were
behind other workers, you could try to figure out what you’re
doing wrong. It may not be the only way to measure your
effectiveness, but it certainly can provide a good reality check.
