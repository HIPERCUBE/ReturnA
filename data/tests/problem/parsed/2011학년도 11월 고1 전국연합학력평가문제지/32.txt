32. 밑줄친부분중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?
If you are having a problem with your neighbor, don’t ① avoid
the neighbor and don’t call the police. It is ② unlikely that
either of those ways will work. Try handling the problem
yourself, remembering to use these strategies: Don’t ③ criticize
your neighbor’s behavior; instead, explain how the behavior is
affecting you. Rather than react ④ rationally, think about what
you want to say and then say it calmly. Be ready to
compromise. If these strategies are not ⑤ effective, the ideal
solution may be to ask another neighbor to help you solve the
problem.
