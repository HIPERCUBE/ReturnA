[48 ~ 50] 다음글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
(A)
I called my son, Josh, during his first semester at college to
wish him luck on his final exams. His response was, “Dad,
there is no such thing as luck. It’s all hard work.” (a) He is a
passionate kid, who throws himself at things that he loves.
At first I thought his response was extreme.
(B)
Josh identified the best trainer in California and drove two
hours each way, several times a week, to learn weight lifting
from　(b) him. Josh read everything he could about the sport,
and spent hours training at the gym. After two years of
weight training, he entered a competition. We arose at 5:00
a.m. and drove three hours to Fresno for it.
(C)
The gym was filled with weight lifters who had been
competing for years. I was worried that the result of his
performance would disappoint (c) him. But Josh blew away
the national records by lifting 50 pounds more than the
previous record holder. Was he lucky?　 No, (d) he would
never have succeeded unless he had put tremendous effort
into achieving his goals.
(D)
But, on further reflection, I believe he had it right. I’ve
watched him with admiration as he has strived to meet goals
others might think impossible. At nineteen, (e) he decided to
try his hand at competitive weight lifting. This wasn’t a
natural choice for a former cyclist, but he was determined to
break the national record for lifts.
