42. For half a century, from Picasso’s arrival in Paris in 1904 to
Henri Matisse’s death in 1954, the two artists were not only
rivals for the leadership of the international avant-garde but
also each other’s greatest critic and fan. They could foster
creativity through rivalry. Throughout history, there are many
other talented contemporaries― Verdi and Wagner, Tolstoy
and Dostoevsky, Gauguin and Van Gogh―who tested and
taught one another, pushing each other to experiment in ways
they might never have dared. Even if they were different in
many aspects, the competition through rivalry inspired greater
innovation.
