The strawberry poison arrow frog is found in the rain forests
of Central America. It has bright red coloring that warns
predators that it is toxic. Frogs are not usually known for their
parenting skills, but strawberry poison arrow frog mothers go
to great lengths for their offspring. Once her tadpoles hatch on
the forest floor, the mother carries her offspring one by one
into the treetops. Her trips often take her 100 feet off the
ground. She places each tadpole into a pool of rain water that
gathers in a leaf. The mother returns to each pool every few
days to bring food. After three weeks, the tadpoles develop
into tiny frogs and leave the water for land.
