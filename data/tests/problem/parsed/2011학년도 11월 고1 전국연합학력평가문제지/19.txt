A few years ago, while setting up camp deep in the rain
forest, Morgan and Sanz heard a party of chimpanzees vocalizing
loudly in the distance. ①They thought the chimpanzees were
moving rapidly among trees. The chimpanzees were yelling
louder and ② they seemed to be heading straight for the camp.
Morgan and Sanz felt the chimpanzees would soon be nearly on
top of the tents. Then, just as ③ they heard the chimpanzees
closing their distance to a few dozen yards, suddenly the forest
went silent. ④They looked up and saw the chimpanzees
peering down. It was such a frightening moment that　Morgan
and Sanz　ran away as if ⑤ they saw ghosts.
