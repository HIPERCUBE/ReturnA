30. 다음글의 ‘I’가마지막에느꼈을심정으로가장적절한것은? [1점]
I was driving when I saw the flash of a traffic camera. I

the block and passed the same spot, driving even more slowly.
But again the camera flashed. Thinking this was pretty funny, I
drove past even slower three more times, laughing as the
camera took pictures each time while I drove by it at a snail’s
pace. Two weeks later, I was at a loss to find that I had got
five tickets in the mail for driving without a seat belt.
