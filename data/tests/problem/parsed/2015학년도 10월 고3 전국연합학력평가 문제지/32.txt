32. ________________________________________. Birds that in 
the breeding season fight one another to death over territory 
may end up in the same flock during migration. I know this 
tendency firsthand from my fish, each time I redo one of 
my large tropical aquariums. Many fish, such as cichlids, are 
quite territorial, displaying with spread fins and chasing one 
another to keep their corner free of intruders. I clean my 
tanks out every couple of years, during which time I keep 
the fish in a barrel. After a few days they are released back 
into the tank, which by then looks quite different from 
before. I am always amused at how they suddenly seek out 
the company of their own kind. Like best buddies, the 
biggest fighters now swim side by side, exploring their new 
environment together. Until, of course, they start to feel 
confident again, and claim a piece of real estate. [3점]
