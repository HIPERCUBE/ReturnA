24. Bargain hunting represents one of the significant reasons 
why people shop. It’s all about the excitement of finding 
merchandise at surprisingly low prices and being able to 
take advantage of such discounts. The thrill of bargain 
hunting motivates shoppers and gives them a feeling of 
winning over the retailers. It’s an important part of the 
shopping mentality and one that retailers could probably take 
better advantage of. How many retailers set out with the 
explicit goal of literally raising the adrenaline levels of their 
shoppers by offering prices that are truly unbelievable or 
exciting? This is surely one way to spur sales and increase 
the interest of shoppers. Everyday sale prices are not the 
same ― the bargain must truly stand out in the consumer’s 
mind as a good deal that is just too exceptional to pass up.
