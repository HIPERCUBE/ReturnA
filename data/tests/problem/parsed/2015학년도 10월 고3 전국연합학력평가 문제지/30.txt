30. The idea that artists have a unique message to 
communicate is only a few hundred years old. For most of 
European history, artists were considered primarily 
craftsmen. When a noble contracted with a painter for a 
work, the contract specified details like the quantities of 
gold and blue paint to appear in the work, the deadline, and 
penalties for delays. A contract in 1485 between the painter 
Domenico Ghirlandaio and a client specified that Ghirlandaio 
would “colour the panel at his own expense with good 
colours and with powdered gold on such ornaments as 
demand it ... and the blue must be ultramarine of the value 
about four florins per ounce”. In some contracts, artists 
were paid by the time worked rather than a fixed price for 
the completed work. These contract details show us that art 
was considered to be a _________ ― a very different concept 
of the artist than we hold today. [3점]
