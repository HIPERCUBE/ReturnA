We can simply state our beliefs, or we can tell stories 
that illustrate them. For example, if John tells Bill that 
he is confused about whether he should keep a cat or a 
dog as a pet, and if Bill responds “A cat,” his reply 
would usually be seen as useless advice. We need 
justifications for the beliefs of others before we can 
begin to believe them ourselves. If Bill responds, “A cat 
is good, because the cat is cute and quiet,” he is being 
more helpful but not necessarily more believable. But if 
Bill responds with a story about a similar situation that 
he was in or that he heard about and how the choice 
was made in that case and how it worked out, John is 
likely to be quite interested and to take the advice 
offered by the story more to heart.

It must have been 1975 or 1976, as I think I was 
twelve or thirteen. I came across a thin book, The 
Limits to Growth, by a curiously named author, the Club 
of Rome. Skimming through the book, even though I 
couldn’t fully understand it, I became very depressed. It 
said that the world will run out of oil in 1992 or 
thereabouts. So, even before I turn thirty, I thought, I 
am supposed to start riding around in horse­drawn carts 
and burn wood for heating? 
The prediction by the Club turned out to be right. We 
have run out of oil ― that is, the oil that was accessible 
with the technologies of the 1970s. But we are still 
burning oil in huge quantities because we have become 
much more efficient in locating and extracting oil from 
places that were just not accessible forty years ago, 
especially the deep sea. 
Technology does not only give us access to formerly 
inaccessible resources but it   the definition 
of what a resource is. Sea waves, formerly only a 
destructive force to be overcome, have become a major 
energy resource, thanks to technological development. 
Coltan used to be a rare mineral of relatively little value 
until the 1980s. Today, it is one of the most valuable 
minerals in the world. Tantalum, one of the component 
elements of coltan, is a key ingredient in the making of 
parts used for mobile phones and other electronic goods.
