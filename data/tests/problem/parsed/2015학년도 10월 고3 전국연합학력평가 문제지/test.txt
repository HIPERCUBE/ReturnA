Dear Ms. O’Leary,
As requested, the cafeteria staff has developed a new 
menu that we believe the students will be excited about. 
First, in addition to our daily specials, gourmet pizza will 
be available every day. We have also created a sundae 
bar that will be open on Fridays, and we will offer main 
dishes from particular cuisines, such as Mexican or 
Chinese.
Following your approval, we will implement these 
changes after the holiday break. If you have any 
questions, please contact me at 655-1472. Otherwise, I 
look forward to receiving your feedback by the end of 
the week. 
Sincerely,
Lora Parker

19. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
We all enjoy the pleasure of being left alone with a good 
book. But sometimes after several hours of immersion we 
lift our heads and look around, suddenly struck by the quiet, 
the absence of others. In this situation, we are suffering 
from reading­induced loneliness. The solution is to read in 
the company of other people who are reading — whether in a 
public space such as a café or a library, or in your own 
home, with your reading friend or partner at the other end 
of the sofa. Next time you look up, you’ll see someone else 
similarly immersed, and you won’t feel alone at all. Reading 
can be sociable. Consider joining a reading group in which 
everybody takes turns reading aloud from a novel. Reading a 
book collaboratively is a wonderful way to share an 
otherwise internal and solitary experience.
① 책을 한 번만 읽지 말고 여러 번 읽어라.
② 오랫동안 읽지 않은 책은 도서관에 기증해라.
③ 책을 혼자 읽지 말고 다른 사람들과 함께 읽어라.
④ 책을 읽고 난 후에 글로 써서 생각을 정리해라.
⑤ 집중력 향상을 위해 소리 내어 책을 읽어라.
20. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
In professional sports these days, it is not unusual ① to 
hear players and coaches talking about process. They talk 
about focusing on the process and following the process. 
Rarely ② do they talk about scoring a goal, a touchdown, a 
home run, a point, or achieving a good shot. It’s all about 
process. So, what do they mean by this? What they mean 
by focusing on the process is that they focus on the actions 
they need to ③ be taken in order to achieve their desired 
result. They don’t focus on the result itself. The reasoning 
here is ④ that if you follow the steps required, then the 
result will look after itself. This is one of the big 
differences between professional and amateur sportspeople. 
Amateurs often focus on the result and forget about ⑤ doing 
all the things that would almost automatically lead to the 
result.
21. 다음 글에 드러난 Billy의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
The departmental head took Billy to view his own private 
office. It was a room situated in St. Joseph’s Hall on the 
edge of the college grounds. “This room was formerly used 
as a guest room for visitors,” she explained. “I hope you’ll 
be comfortable here.” Comfortable! That’s putting it mildly, 
Billy thought. A shiver of delight ran down his spine when 
he saw his name in capital letters on the door: MR BILLY 
HOPKINS, SENIOR LECTURER IN EDUCATION. The room 
was spacious and there was a large window overlooking the 
college grounds. Billy sat at his desk and looked out at the 
neat lawns and flower­filled gardens. Somewhere in the 
college a choir was singing and his joy was complete.
① happy ② envious ③ ashamed
④ lonely ⑤ nervous
22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
The human species and human culture evolved through 
interaction with the entire communities of animals and 
plants. Of the two great influences that make humans what 
they are, heredity and environment, environment is 
undoubtedly the more powerful. After all, heredity itself 
encodes the results of millions of years of environmental 
influences on the human genome. Even genetic mutations 
are, to some extent, caused by environmental factors. 
Evolution is largely the result of natural selection that takes 
place because humans, during their history of development 
as a species, have been part of biotic communities in which 
their interactions with other species of animals and plants 
have decided whether or not they survived and reproduced.
* mutation: 돌연변이
① influences of humans on environment
② roles of heredity in human behaviors
③ necessity of further research on genome
④ problems of human separation from nature
⑤ impact of environment on human evolution
[23 ~ 24] 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
23. When we lived as foragers with earthbound religions, 
animals were the first beings, world­shapers, and the 
teachers and ancestors of people. When we became 
agriculturalists and looked to the heavens for instruction 
about the seasons and bad weather, we saw animal forms 
among the stars. Of the forty­eight Ptolemaic constellations, 
all but a few are organic, and twenty­five are named for 
animals. Of the twenty­two more that were added in the 
17th century, nineteen have animal names. When people built 
huge earthworks to appeal to the powers of heavens, they 
built them in animal forms. Some in Peru are over a mile 
long. One in Ohio is in the shape of a giant snake with an 
egg in its mouth. [3점]

② Efforts to Record Disappearing Species
③ Origins of the Names of Heavenly Bodies

24. Bargain hunting represents one of the significant reasons 
why people shop. It’s all about the excitement of finding 
merchandise at surprisingly low prices and being able to 
take advantage of such discounts. The thrill of bargain 
hunting motivates shoppers and gives them a feeling of 
winning over the retailers. It’s an important part of the 
shopping mentality and one that retailers could probably take 
better advantage of. How many retailers set out with the 
explicit goal of literally raising the adrenaline levels of their 
shoppers by offering prices that are truly unbelievable or 
exciting? This is surely one way to spur sales and increase 
the interest of shoppers. Everyday sale prices are not the 
same ― the bargain must truly stand out in the consumer’s 
mind as a good deal that is just too exceptional to pass up.
① Bargain Hunting: A Motivation for Shopping
② Customer Service Outweighs Price
③ Low Prices, Low Productivity
④ Online Shopping Causes Crisis for Retailers
⑤ To Shop or Not to Shop? Just Say No to Shopping

Average Annual Entertainment Expenditures of
US Urban and Rural Households, 2011
The above graph shows the average annual entertainment 
expenditures of US urban and rural households in 2011. ①
Of the five categories, urban households spent more on fees 
and admissions and on audio and visual equipment and 
services than rural households, while rural households spent 
more than urban households in the other three categories. ②
Both urban and rural households spent the most on audio 
and visual equipment and services. ③ In contrast, the 
smallest amount of money was spent on toys, hobbies, and 
playground equipment by both urban and rural households. ④
The largest gap between the expenditures of urban and rural 
households, amounting to more than $300, was found in the 
category of fees and admission. ⑤ However, the smallest 
gap between urban and rural expenditures was shown in the 
category of pets, on which urban households spent about 
$500 and rural households about $700.
26. Allan Houser에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Allan Houser created contemporary Apache sculpture. As a 
child, he listened to his father’s stories about the adventures 
of Chief Geronimo. This gave him a deep attachment to his 
ancestral background, an attachment that is shown in his 
artwork. Houser studied at the Indian School in Santa Fe, 
New Mexico, and then remained in Santa Fe, where he 
worked as a freelance artist. During World War II, he 
traveled to California, where he became interested in the 
media of sculpture. He created works in a variety of styles 
and mastered bronze, metal, and stone sculpture. Houser’s 
designs are modern, yet firmly rooted in the special tradition 
of his Native American forefathers. He drew inspiration from 
both past and present, but like all successful artists, his 
sculpture transcends race and language. The sculpture 
Reverie shows a distinct Native American influence, but it 
can be appreciated by anyone, regardless of his or her 
background.
① 자기 선조에 대한 깊은 애착을 갖게 되었다.

Grandma put her things down on the sand and walked over 
to Phoebe on the shore by the water. Schools of minnows 
were everywhere in the crystal clear water. Phoebe was 
going crazy watching the minnows. ① She said, “Grandma, I 
want to catch a fish.” When ② she handed Phoebe the very 
small net, Phoebe immediately tried to scoop up the 
minnows. It took Phoebe less than ten minutes, and even 
that was too long, for Phoebe to catch ③ her first minnow. 
After many frustrating attempts, ④ she finally screeched 
with joy and ran to Grandma sitting on her beach towel. 
“Grandma, look, I caught a fish!” Phoebe gave the minnow to 
Grandma, which she kept for Phoebe in a clear, plastic 
container as a souvenir of Phoebe catching ⑤ her first fish.

Toys are cultural objects that children learn to play with 
in particular and culturally appropriate ways. Through 
participating in complex play, caregivers demonstrate 
traditional ways of object use.    (A)   , when a mother 
models a telephone conversation during pretend play, she 
first dials the number, waits for a response, and only then 
begins to talk. If, while imitating the telephone conversation, 
the child forgets to dial the number, or mistakes the order 
of action, the mother may adjust the child’s actions, thus 
teaching the correct way of play. Parent-child object play is 
also a medium through which children practice real­life 
scenarios (e.g. doctor-patient, mother-baby). Children’s 
knowledge of cultural activities also contributes to the 
structure of parent-child play. When children play with 
familiar toys, they are more likely to facilitate pretend play, 
while parents serve as an audience.    (B)   , when novel 
toys are used in the course of parent-child play, parents 
are more likely to start and organize the pretense.

Parents are commonly reluctant to grant their grown 
children equal footing with them as adults. This delay can 
persist into later life, especially if geographic distance 
prevents parents from witnessing their children’s success in 
jobs or relationships. ① More decisively than most life 
experiences, illness can cause a change in such a 
relationship by forcing parents to accept help from their 
children. ② A father who decides to rely on his son to do 
his banking, for example, implicitly affirms his son’s 
capabilities as an adult. ③ Such reliance conveys a trust that 
may be deeply satisfying to the son. ④ Parents encourage 
creative activities in the child and participate with him in 
such activities. ⑤ By allowing his son to be a provider of 
help, the father actually gives emotionally more than he 
receives practically.

Until the mid­20th century, only a few immigrants paid a 
visit to their homeland once or twice before they died, but 
most never returned to the land of their birth. This pattern has 
completely changed with the advent of globalization, coupled 
with the digital revolution that has (A) enhanced / hindered  
communication. As a result, immigration is a very different 
experience from what it was in the past. The ability of 
immigrant families to (B) object / reconnect  to their old 
culture via phone, television, and the Internet has changed 
their approach to integration into mainstream American 
society. This has also greatly influenced immigrant practices 
of socialization with children. Contacts with the country of 
origin are now more frequent, and result in more immigrant 
families being influenced to (C) abandon / maintain  cultural

their children to keep them.

Although every forensic case is different, each case 
goes through many of the same phases. Each phase 
requires its own procedures and expertise. Throughout 
each phase, the chain of evidence must remain intact. 
(A) Although changes may be made, this synthesis is the 
formal interpretation of the data and provides the most 
logical explanation or reconstruction of the events and 
the identification of the remains.
(B) Next, laboratory analysis and research on the remains 
and evidence proceed. At some point, all of the data 
from the different labs and investigators comes together 
and is synthesized into the case report. 
(C) The first phase is usually the discovery of the case. 
More likely than not, discovery is made by accident. 
The second phase is recovery of the remains and 
evidence. This and future phases require professional 
help.

In each life, there are many important pieces that 
make up the whole. They can be thought of like pie 
slices.
(A) For example, if there is difficulty with work, the family, 
finances, and mental health will likely be impacted in a 
negative manner. Conversely, if an individual has 
employment that is fulfilling and rewarding, this will 
positively impact other pieces of the self.
(B) Each slice represents an important part of the self. 
There will be universal slices in each person’s pie, and 
there will also be slices unique to that specific 
individual’s personality.

health/well­being, home, family, work, finances, and

In contrast, when we tell a truthful story, we include 
20% to 30% more detail.  
Lie detector tests base judgments of honesty on blood 
pressure, pulse, respiration, and vocal pitch, which the test 
assumes differ when people lie and when they tell the truth. 
However, lie detector tests have not proven particularly 
reliable. ( ① ) Now law enforcement has a new tool for 
detecting deception: the detail in stories told by people 
being questioned. ( ② ) New research indicates that when 
people lie, they develop a tight, bare­bones script and stick 
with it. ( ③ ) They do not include details and comments 
on context because that just adds to what they have to 
remember. ( ④ ) That is, people who are giving honest 
accounts tend to recall details about context ― what was 
happening at the time of the event, who was present ― that 
are not related to the main story. ( ⑤ ) The researchers 
explain that “if you’re telling the truth, this mental 
reinstatement of contexts triggers more and more external 
details.”

Some of the same essential oil properties that serve 
plants in nature also provide health benefits to humans.
The essential oil, it has been said, is the heart and soul 
of a plant. ( ① ) It gives a plant its scent and may also 
drive away insects, attract bees and wasps for fertilization 
of the plant’s flowers, and protect the plant against decay, 
bacteria, and mold. ( ② ) Food manufacturers, for example, 
sometimes include essential oils in their products as a way 
of preventing bacterial growth. ( ③ ) The oils are purer and 
more healthful than chemical antibacterial agents, such as 
chlorine. ( ④ ) Many skincare products also make use of 
antibacterial essential oils. ( ⑤ ) In nature, these oils 
protect plants against bacteria, and they do the same for us 
when rubbed on the skin.

We can simply state our beliefs, or we can tell stories 
that illustrate them. For example, if John tells Bill that 
he is confused about whether he should keep a cat or a 
dog as a pet, and if Bill responds “A cat,” his reply 
would usually be seen as useless advice. We need 
justifications for the beliefs of others before we can 
begin to believe them ourselves. If Bill responds, “A cat 
is good, because the cat is cute and quiet,” he is being 
more helpful but not necessarily more believable. But if 
Bill responds with a story about a similar situation that 
he was in or that he heard about and how the choice 
was made in that case and how it worked out, John is 
likely to be quite interested and to take the advice 
offered by the story more to heart.

It must have been 1975 or 1976, as I think I was 
twelve or thirteen. I came across a thin book, The 
Limits to Growth, by a curiously named author, the Club 
of Rome. Skimming through the book, even though I 
couldn’t fully understand it, I became very depressed. It 
said that the world will run out of oil in 1992 or 
thereabouts. So, even before I turn thirty, I thought, I 
am supposed to start riding around in horse­drawn carts 
and burn wood for heating? 
The prediction by the Club turned out to be right. We 
have run out of oil ― that is, the oil that was accessible 
with the technologies of the 1970s. But we are still 
burning oil in huge quantities because we have become 
much more efficient in locating and extracting oil from 
places that were just not accessible forty years ago, 
especially the deep sea. 
Technology does not only give us access to formerly 
inaccessible resources but it   the definition 
of what a resource is. Sea waves, formerly only a 
destructive force to be overcome, have become a major 
energy resource, thanks to technological development. 
Coltan used to be a rare mineral of relatively little value 
until the 1980s. Today, it is one of the most valuable 
minerals in the world. Tantalum, one of the component 
elements of coltan, is a key ingredient in the making of 
parts used for mobile phones and other electronic goods.

In the winter of 1995, the weather was so cold that 
over four inches of ice formed on a small lake in 
Indiana, making it safe to walk on. However, a few 
warm days in February melted some of the ice, making 
it dangerous to walk on. Unfortunately, 12­year­old Josh 
Mitchell didn’t realize that, and he decided to take a 
shortcut to a friend’s house by walking across the 
semi­frozen lake. He fell through the ice, and a dog 
named Levi, the pet of Denise and George Hammond, 
saw (a) him and started whining.
(B)
Denise fainted when she reached the shore, but 
paramedics took care of her and Josh and took them to 
the hospital, where they quickly recovered. Of course, 
Josh and (b) his parents were grateful to Levi and the 
Hammonds, and they sent them gifts: bones for Levi, a 
big bouquet of flowers for Denise, and a gift certificate 
to be used at a pet store.

Josh, then she kept (c) him afloat. George called Levi, 
and Levi came out of the water. Two neighbors brought 
an extension ladder out to the lake and pushed it to 
where Denise and Josh were. Denise pushed (d) him up 
on the ladder and then climbed up on the ladder herself. 
The ladder distributed their weight across a large area 
of the ice so that they didn’t fall through, and they 
reached the shore.
(D)
George saw Josh floundering in the icy water. (e) He 
ordered, “Levi, fetch!” Levi ran out onto the lake, 
jumped into the water, and allowed Josh to hold on to 
him. Meanwhile, George and Denise brought Levi’s 
20­foot leash out to the lake and tried to throw it to 
Josh, but the leash was too short. Because she didn’t 
know how long Levi could keep Josh afloat, Denise went 
out on the ice, knowing that although she weighed less 
than her husband, she would probably fall through the 
ice. In fact, she did fall through the ice four feet away 
from Josh.
