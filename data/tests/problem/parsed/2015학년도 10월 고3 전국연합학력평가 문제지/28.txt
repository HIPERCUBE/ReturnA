Toys are cultural objects that children learn to play with 
in particular and culturally appropriate ways. Through 
participating in complex play, caregivers demonstrate 
traditional ways of object use.    (A)   , when a mother 
models a telephone conversation during pretend play, she 
first dials the number, waits for a response, and only then 
begins to talk. If, while imitating the telephone conversation, 
the child forgets to dial the number, or mistakes the order 
of action, the mother may adjust the child’s actions, thus 
teaching the correct way of play. Parent-child object play is 
also a medium through which children practice real­life 
scenarios (e.g. doctor-patient, mother-baby). Children’s 
knowledge of cultural activities also contributes to the 
structure of parent-child play. When children play with 
familiar toys, they are more likely to facilitate pretend play, 
while parents serve as an audience.    (B)   , when novel 
toys are used in the course of parent-child play, parents 
are more likely to start and organize the pretense.

Parents are commonly reluctant to grant their grown 
children equal footing with them as adults. This delay can 
persist into later life, especially if geographic distance 
prevents parents from witnessing their children’s success in 
jobs or relationships. ① More decisively than most life 
experiences, illness can cause a change in such a 
relationship by forcing parents to accept help from their 
children. ② A father who decides to rely on his son to do 
his banking, for example, implicitly affirms his son’s 
capabilities as an adult. ③ Such reliance conveys a trust that 
may be deeply satisfying to the son. ④ Parents encourage 
creative activities in the child and participate with him in 
such activities. ⑤ By allowing his son to be a provider of 
help, the father actually gives emotionally more than he 
receives practically.

Until the mid­20th century, only a few immigrants paid a 
visit to their homeland once or twice before they died, but 
most never returned to the land of their birth. This pattern has 
completely changed with the advent of globalization, coupled 
with the digital revolution that has (A) enhanced / hindered  
communication. As a result, immigration is a very different 
experience from what it was in the past. The ability of 
immigrant families to (B) object / reconnect  to their old 
culture via phone, television, and the Internet has changed 
their approach to integration into mainstream American 
society. This has also greatly influenced immigrant practices 
of socialization with children. Contacts with the country of 
origin are now more frequent, and result in more immigrant 
families being influenced to (C) abandon / maintain  cultural 
patterns from the homeland, and to attempt to influence 
their children to keep them.

Although every forensic case is different, each case 
goes through many of the same phases. Each phase 
requires its own procedures and expertise. Throughout 
each phase, the chain of evidence must remain intact. 
(A) Although changes may be made, this synthesis is the 
formal interpretation of the data and provides the most 
logical explanation or reconstruction of the events and 
the identification of the remains.
(B) Next, laboratory analysis and research on the remains 
and evidence proceed. At some point, all of the data 
from the different labs and investigators comes together 
and is synthesized into the case report. 
(C) The first phase is usually the discovery of the case. 
More likely than not, discovery is made by accident. 
The second phase is recovery of the remains and 
evidence. This and future phases require professional 
help.

In each life, there are many important pieces that 
make up the whole. They can be thought of like pie 
slices.
(A) For example, if there is difficulty with work, the family, 
finances, and mental health will likely be impacted in a 
negative manner. Conversely, if an individual has 
employment that is fulfilling and rewarding, this will 
positively impact other pieces of the self.
(B) Each slice represents an important part of the self. 
There will be universal slices in each person’s pie, and 
there will also be slices unique to that specific 
individual’s personality.
(C) Some fairly universal slices may include 
health/well­being, home, family, work, finances, and 
relationships. Unique slices of the self can include 
hobbies, spirituality, and education. Each slice of the 
self impacts the others.

In contrast, when we tell a truthful story, we include 
20% to 30% more detail.  
Lie detector tests base judgments of honesty on blood 
pressure, pulse, respiration, and vocal pitch, which the test 
assumes differ when people lie and when they tell the truth. 
However, lie detector tests have not proven particularly 
reliable. ( ① ) Now law enforcement has a new tool for 
detecting deception: the detail in stories told by people 
being questioned. ( ② ) New research indicates that when 
people lie, they develop a tight, bare­bones script and stick 
with it. ( ③ ) They do not include details and comments 
on context because that just adds to what they have to 
remember. ( ④ ) That is, people who are giving honest 
accounts tend to recall details about context ― what was 
happening at the time of the event, who was present ― that 
are not related to the main story. ( ⑤ ) The researchers 
explain that “if you’re telling the truth, this mental 
reinstatement of contexts triggers more and more external 
details.”

Some of the same essential oil properties that serve 
plants in nature also provide health benefits to humans.
The essential oil, it has been said, is the heart and soul 
of a plant. ( ① ) It gives a plant its scent and may also 
drive away insects, attract bees and wasps for fertilization 
of the plant’s flowers, and protect the plant against decay, 
bacteria, and mold. ( ② ) Food manufacturers, for example, 
sometimes include essential oils in their products as a way 
of preventing bacterial growth. ( ③ ) The oils are purer and 
more healthful than chemical antibacterial agents, such as 
chlorine. ( ④ ) Many skincare products also make use of 
antibacterial essential oils. ( ⑤ ) In nature, these oils 
protect plants against bacteria, and they do the same for us 
when rubbed on the skin.

We can simply state our beliefs, or we can tell stories 
that illustrate them. For example, if John tells Bill that 
he is confused about whether he should keep a cat or a 
dog as a pet, and if Bill responds “A cat,” his reply 
would usually be seen as useless advice. We need 
justifications for the beliefs of others before we can 
begin to believe them ourselves. If Bill responds, “A cat 
is good, because the cat is cute and quiet,” he is being 
more helpful but not necessarily more believable. But if 
Bill responds with a story about a similar situation that 
he was in or that he heard about and how the choice 
was made in that case and how it worked out, John is 
likely to be quite interested and to take the advice 
offered by the story more to heart.

[41 ∼ 42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
It must have been 1975 or 1976, as I think I was 
twelve or thirteen. I came across a thin book, The 
Limits to Growth, by a curiously named author, the Club 
of Rome. Skimming through the book, even though I 
couldn’t fully understand it, I became very depressed. It 
said that the world will run out of oil in 1992 or 
thereabouts. So, even before I turn thirty, I thought, I 
am supposed to start riding around in horse­drawn carts 
and burn wood for heating? 
The prediction by the Club turned out to be right. We 
have run out of oil ― that is, the oil that was accessible 
with the technologies of the 1970s. But we are still 
burning oil in huge quantities because we have become 
much more efficient in locating and extracting oil from 
places that were just not accessible forty years ago, 
especially the deep sea. 
Technology does not only give us access to formerly 
inaccessible resources but it   the definition 
of what a resource is. Sea waves, formerly only a 
destructive force to be overcome, have become a major 
energy resource, thanks to technological development. 
Coltan used to be a rare mineral of relatively little value 
until the 1980s. Today, it is one of the most valuable 
minerals in the world. Tantalum, one of the component 
elements of coltan, is a key ingredient in the making of 
parts used for mobile phones and other electronic goods.
