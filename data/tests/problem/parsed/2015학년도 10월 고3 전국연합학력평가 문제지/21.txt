The departmental head took Billy to view his own private 
office. It was a room situated in St. Joseph’s Hall on the 
edge of the college grounds. “This room was formerly used 
as a guest room for visitors,” she explained. “I hope you’ll 
be comfortable here.” Comfortable! That’s putting it mildly, 
Billy thought. A shiver of delight ran down his spine when 
he saw his name in capital letters on the door: MR BILLY 
HOPKINS, SENIOR LECTURER IN EDUCATION. The room 
was spacious and there was a large window overlooking the 
college grounds. Billy sat at his desk and looked out at the 
neat lawns and flower­filled gardens. Somewhere in the 
college a choir was singing and his joy was complete.
