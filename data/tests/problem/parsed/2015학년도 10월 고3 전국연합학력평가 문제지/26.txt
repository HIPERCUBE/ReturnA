26. Allan Houser에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Allan Houser created contemporary Apache sculpture. As a 
child, he listened to his father’s stories about the adventures 
of Chief Geronimo. This gave him a deep attachment to his 
ancestral background, an attachment that is shown in his 
artwork. Houser studied at the Indian School in Santa Fe, 
New Mexico, and then remained in Santa Fe, where he 
worked as a freelance artist. During World War II, he 
traveled to California, where he became interested in the 
media of sculpture. He created works in a variety of styles 
and mastered bronze, metal, and stone sculpture. Houser’s 
designs are modern, yet firmly rooted in the special tradition 
of his Native American forefathers. He drew inspiration from 
both past and present, but like all successful artists, his 
sculpture transcends race and language. The sculpture 
Reverie shows a distinct Native American influence, but it 
can be appreciated by anyone, regardless of his or her 
background.
