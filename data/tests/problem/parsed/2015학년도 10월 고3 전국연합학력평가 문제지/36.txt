Although every forensic case is different, each case 
goes through many of the same phases. Each phase 
requires its own procedures and expertise. Throughout 
each phase, the chain of evidence must remain intact. 
(A) Although changes may be made, this synthesis is the 
formal interpretation of the data and provides the most 
logical explanation or reconstruction of the events and 
the identification of the remains.
(B) Next, laboratory analysis and research on the remains 
and evidence proceed. At some point, all of the data 
from the different labs and investigators comes together 
and is synthesized into the case report. 
(C) The first phase is usually the discovery of the case. 
More likely than not, discovery is made by accident. 
The second phase is recovery of the remains and 
evidence. This and future phases require professional 
help.
