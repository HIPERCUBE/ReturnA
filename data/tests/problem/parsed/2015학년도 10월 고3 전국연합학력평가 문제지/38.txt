38.
In contrast, when we tell a truthful story, we include 
20% to 30% more detail.  
Lie detector tests base judgments of honesty on blood 
pressure, pulse, respiration, and vocal pitch, which the test 
assumes differ when people lie and when they tell the truth. 
However, lie detector tests have not proven particularly 
reliable. ( ① ) Now law enforcement has a new tool for 
detecting deception: the detail in stories told by people 
being questioned. ( ② ) New research indicates that when 
people lie, they develop a tight, bare­bones script and stick 
with it. ( ③ ) They do not include details and comments 
on context because that just adds to what they have to 
remember. ( ④ ) That is, people who are giving honest 
accounts tend to recall details about context ― what was 
happening at the time of the event, who was present ― that 
are not related to the main story. ( ⑤ ) The researchers 
explain that “if you’re telling the truth, this mental 
reinstatement of contexts triggers more and more external 
details.”
