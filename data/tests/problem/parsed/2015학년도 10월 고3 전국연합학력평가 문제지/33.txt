Toys are cultural objects that children learn to play with 
in particular and culturally appropriate ways. Through 
participating in complex play, caregivers demonstrate 
traditional ways of object use.    (A)   , when a mother 
models a telephone conversation during pretend play, she 
first dials the number, waits for a response, and only then 
begins to talk. If, while imitating the telephone conversation, 
the child forgets to dial the number, or mistakes the order 
of action, the mother may adjust the child’s actions, thus 
teaching the correct way of play. Parent-child object play is 
also a medium through which children practice real­life 
scenarios (e.g. doctor-patient, mother-baby). Children’s 
knowledge of cultural activities also contributes to the 
structure of parent-child play. When children play with 
familiar toys, they are more likely to facilitate pretend play, 
while parents serve as an audience.    (B)   , when novel 
toys are used in the course of parent-child play, parents 
are more likely to start and organize the pretense.
