In each life, there are many important pieces that 
make up the whole. They can be thought of like pie 
slices.
(A) For example, if there is difficulty with work, the family, 
finances, and mental health will likely be impacted in a 
negative manner. Conversely, if an individual has 
employment that is fulfilling and rewarding, this will 
positively impact other pieces of the self.
(B) Each slice represents an important part of the self. 
There will be universal slices in each person’s pie, and 
there will also be slices unique to that specific 
individual’s personality.
(C) Some fairly universal slices may include 
health/well­being, home, family, work, finances, and 
relationships. Unique slices of the self can include 
hobbies, spirituality, and education. Each slice of the 
self impacts the others.
