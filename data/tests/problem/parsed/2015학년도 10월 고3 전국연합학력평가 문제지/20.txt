20. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
In professional sports these days, it is not unusual ① to 
hear players and coaches talking about process. They talk 
about focusing on the process and following the process. 
Rarely ② do they talk about scoring a goal, a touchdown, a 
home run, a point, or achieving a good shot. It’s all about 
process. So, what do they mean by this? What they mean 
by focusing on the process is that they focus on the actions 
they need to ③ be taken in order to achieve their desired 
result. They don’t focus on the result itself. The reasoning 
here is ④ that if you follow the steps required, then the 
result will look after itself. This is one of the big 
differences between professional and amateur sportspeople. 
Amateurs often focus on the result and forget about ⑤ doing 
all the things that would almost automatically lead to the 
result.
