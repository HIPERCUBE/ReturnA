23. When we lived as foragers with earthbound religions, 
animals were the first beings, world­shapers, and the 
teachers and ancestors of people. When we became 
agriculturalists and looked to the heavens for instruction 
about the seasons and bad weather, we saw animal forms 
among the stars. Of the forty­eight Ptolemaic constellations, 
all but a few are organic, and twenty­five are named for 
animals. Of the twenty­two more that were added in the 
17th century, nineteen have animal names. When people built 
huge earthworks to appeal to the powers of heavens, they 
built them in animal forms. Some in Peru are over a mile 
long. One in Ohio is in the shape of a giant snake with an 
egg in its mouth. [3점]
