An experiment done on men in North Carolina shows
how helpless we can be in the face of praise. The men in
the study received comments about themselves from
another person who needed a favor from them. Some of
the men got only positive comments, some got only
negative comments, and some got a mixture of good and
bad. There were three interesting findings. First, the
evaluator who provided only praise was liked best by the
men. Second, this was the case even though the men fully
realized that the flatterer stood to gain from their liking
him. Finally, unlike the other types of comments, pure
praise did not have to be accurate to work. Positive
comments produced just as much liking for the flatterer
when they were untrue as when they were true.
In an experiment on reactions to praise, it was found that the
most (A) person was the one who had given praise
only, regardless of the (B) of the compliment.
(A) (B)
① favored …… sincerity
② favored …… magnitude
③ disliked …… frequency
④ disliked …… speaker
⑤ respected …… timing

(A)
Charles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New York
City, was assigned to prepare a report on a certain
corporation. He knew of only one man who possessed the
facts he needed so urgently. The man was Mr. Smith,
president of a large industrial company. Charles went to see
the president to ask for help. As Charles was ushered into
(a) his office, a young woman stuck her head through a door
and told the president that she didn’t have any stamps for
him that day.
(B)
The next afternoon he called on Mr. Smith and said that he
had some stamps for his son. Was Charles ushered in with
enthusiasm? Yes. Mr. Smith couldn’t have shaken his hand
with more enthusiasm if he had been running for Congress.
He radiated smiles and good will. “My George will love this
one,” he kept saying as (b) he handled the stamps. “And look
at this! This is treasure.”
(C)
Charles spent half an hour talking with Mr. Smith about
stamps and looking at the picture of his boy. Mr. Smith then
devoted more than an hour to giving every bit of information
Charles wanted. He told Charles all (c) he knew, and then
called in his employees and questioned them. He telephoned
some of his associates. He loaded Charles down with facts,
figures, and reports. In the journalists’ term, Charles had a
scoop.
(D)
Mr. Smith explained to Charles that (d) he was collecting
stamps for his twelve-year-old son. Charles stated his
mission, and began asking questions. Mr. Smith didn’t want
to talk. The first interview with Mr. Smith was brief and
barren. Then Charles remembered what the secretary had
said to Mr. Smith— stamps. And (e) he also recalled that the
foreign department of his bank collected stamps taken from
letters pouring in from all over the world.

Norms may be cultural, but traffic can also create its own
culture. Consider the case of jaywalking in New York City
and Copenhagen. In both places, jaywalking, or crossing
against the light, is technically prohibited. In both places,
people have been ticketed for doing it. But the visitor to
either city today will witness a shocking study in contrast. In
New York City, where the term jaywalking was popularized,
waiting for the signal is now a sign that you are from the
countryside. By contrast, the average Copenhagen resident
seems to have hostility to people crossing against the light.
It is tempting to attribute the differences to culture. In
New York City, a melting pot of different traditions and a
hotbed of individualism, jaywalking is a way to distinguish
yourself from the crowd and get ahead. Pedestrians look at
cars, not lights. Jaywalking also helps relieve overcrowded
intersections. In Copenhagen, which historically has had a
more community-focused population, jaywalking is an act of
bad taste, an unnecessary departure from the harmony that
sustains communities. Waiting for the light to change, like
waiting for spring, seems a test of the cold Scandinavian
soul. A Danish-Norwegian novelist described a set of laws
inspired by the small Danish town where he was raised.
They all basically had the same theme: Do not think you are
better than anyone else. These laws are still popular
shorthand toward explaining the relative social nature of
Scandinavian societies, and it is not hard to imagine them
applied to traffic. Jaywalking, like speeding or excessive lane
changing, is just a form of self-centeredness that disrupts
.
