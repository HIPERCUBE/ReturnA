38. Herta Müller에 대한 다음 글의 내용과일치하지 않는 것은?
The 2009 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to
Romanian-born German author Herta Müller, a distinct and
compelling voice of opposition against political oppression and
the anguish of human existence. Known primarily as a novelist,
Müller also wrote a lot of works as a short-story writer, poet,
and essayist. Her works portrayed the harsh reality of life in
Romania. Although she was highly regarded by those who read
her, Müller was limited to a German-speaking audience for
much of her career. She was the 12th woman to receive the
Nobel Prize for Literature and the first German writer to win
since 1999, when the award was presented to Günter Grass.
Criticizing all forms of totalitarian rule, she was drawn to those
who were abused by authority.
