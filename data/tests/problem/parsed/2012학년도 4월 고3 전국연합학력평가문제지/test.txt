It was a long day, which included picking up her son. At
6:30 p.m., Jane found herself at the local grocery store
helping him with his homework. After unloading their cart at
the checkout, Jane realized to her utter embarrassment that
① her wallet was not in the purse. Without any hesitation,
the checkout lady in front of ② her said, “Put it through. I’ll
take care of it.” Jane was shocked and hesitated, but the lady
insisted. Jane asked about how to pay ③ her back and the
lady said, “You can leave it with the staff in an envelope for
Ann Shirley.” She didn’t ask for ④ her name or phone number
― not a thing. Jane and ⑤ her son were amazed. It was a
lovely gift to start off the new year. She reminded them that
life is too short not to lend a helping hand when the
opportunity arises.

Driving is, for most of us, what psychologists call an
overlearned activity. It is something we are so well ① practiced
at that we are able to do it without much conscious thought.
That makes our life easier, and it is ② how we become good at
things. Think of an expert tennis player. A serve is a complex
maneuver with many different components, but ③ the better we
become at it, the less we think of each individual step. One of
the interesting things about learning and attention ④ are that
once something becomes automated, it gets executed in a rapid
string of events. If you try to pay attention, you ⑤ screw it up.
This is why the best hitters in baseball do not necessarily make
the best hitting coaches.
22. 다음글에서전체흐름과관계 없는 문장은?
A mountain floats on the Earth’s semiliquid mantle with only
its tip showing. So, like floating icebergs, mountains are deeper
than they are high. From this fact comes another interesting
fact about mountains. ① If you could shave off the top of an
iceberg, the iceberg would be lighter and would be raised to
nearly its original height before being shaved. ② Likewise,
when mountains erode, they are lighter, and they are pushed
from below to float to nearly their original heights. ③A method
of computing the heights of mountains from sea level became
popular among many scientists. ④ So, when a kilometer of
mountain erodes away, some 85% of a kilometer of mountain
pushes up from below. ⑤That is why it takes so long for
mountains to weather away.

My wife was preparing breakfast as I stood in the backyard
gazing beyond a row of palm trees at the early morning sun
forcing its rays. Our six-year-old daughter, Becky, was
watching a pair of quarreling blue jays through the livingroom
window. Suddenly I snapped to attention. An ugly and
misshapen creature was wandering just in front of the house. In
the hazy light of the early morning it appeared like a monster
out of the past. It was a huge thing, armed with long, curving
tusks. I realized suddenly what it was: a fierce wild hog. I took
no time to ponder where it came from or how it had managed to
penetrate a thickly populated residential section. I tried to run
inside, but it was too late. We had sighted each other
simultaneously. Its gleaming button eyes were fastened on me
and the beast’s four stubby legs were ready to attack.

24. 다음글에서필자가주장하는바로가장적절한것은?
The purpose of nature-study is to know the subject under
observation and to learn the name incidentally. If you say, “I
have a pink hepatica. Can anyone find me a blue one?” the
children will soon be calling these flowers hepaticas. But if you
say, “These flowers are called hepaticas. Now please remember
the name, and in half an hour I shall ask you again what it is,”
the pupils naturally look upon the exercise as a word lesson and
its real significance is lost. This sort of nature-study is
ineffective. Children should never be ‘required’ to learn the
name of anything in the nature-study work. The name should
be used so often and so naturally in their presence that they
will learn it without being conscious of the process.

25. A political scientist has done a series of experiments to
demonstrate the positive effects of . In those
experiments, he used computer-simulated agents that were
programmed to solve problems. He set up a series of groups of
ten or twenty agents, with each agent endowed with a different
set of skills, and had them solve a relatively sophisticated
problem. Individually, some of the agents were very good at
solving the problem while others were less effective. But what
he found was that a group made up of some smart agents and
some not-so-smart agents almost always did better than a
group made up just of smart agents. You could do as well or
better by selecting a group randomly and letting it solve the
problem as by spending a lot of time trying to find the smart
agents and then putting them alone on the problem. [3점]

26. Although keeping your aims to yourself helps ease the fear
of failure, it also makes it easy to avoid changing your life and
drift back into old habits and routines. This is in keeping with
several key findings from psychology. People are more likely to
stick to their views and promises if they have made a public
commitment. In one classic study, students were asked to
estimate the length of some lines that had been drawn on a pad,
and either make a public announcement about their judgements,
or keep the estimates to themselves. When the participants
were informed that their estimates might be wrong, those who
were far more likely to stand by their
opinion than those who had not told anyone.
① had gone public ② kept their words
③were against others ④ believed in themselves
⑤ had gained clear proof
27. I do have a problem with each social network being ,
and while there is some cross-functionality, they are not
playing with one another as seamlessly as many of us would
like. Think about that in comparison with email: You can email
anyone else with an email address. It does not matter that you
are on Gmail and the other person is on Hotmail. Because email
was developed as an open system that was not market driven,
standards were developed to ensure that different systems
could talk to one another. That is not the case with social
networks. If I am only on MySpace, and you are only on
Facebook, we cannot interact. Additionally, if one of those
services goes down or goes away, we are kind of stuck—we
have to move on to another service and start all over.
① security concerns ② its own little world
③ open to everybody ④ controlled by the authorities
⑤ overlooked by the elderly
28. There is a story that Galileo dropped two different weights
off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which may or may not be true.
But we do know that Galileo was very clever in the way he
measured how things fall. When Galileo lived, about 400 years
ago, there were no watches or clocks. Any falling object fell
too fast for him to measure how long it took. So, Galileo
decided to slow down falling objects. Instead of dropping
objects off buildings, he decided to roll balls down a ramp. He
figured that the same force that made things fall would make
balls roll down a ramp. This force is called gravity. A ramp
would make it easier to . He measured
the time by catching drops of water while a ball rolled. He
could change the steepness of the ramp and measure the
distance the ball traveled while water dripped. The steepest
ramp was very close to a free fall.
* ramp: 경사로
① throw a ball high ② see gravity in action
③ balance the weights ④ speed up falling objects
⑤measure the steepness
29. To understand the difficulty of predicting the next 100
years, we have to appreciate the difficulty that the people of
1900 had in predicting the world of 2000. In 1893, as part of
the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, seventy-four
well-known individuals were asked to predict what life would
be like in the next 100 years. The one problem was that they
. For example,
many correctly predicted that we would one day have
commercial transatlantic airships, but they thought that they
would be balloons. Senator John J. Ingalls said, “It will be as
common for the citizen to call for his dirigible balloon as it now
is for his buggy.” They also consistently missed the coming of
the automobile. Postmaster General John Wanamaker stated
that the U.S. mail would be delivered by stagecoach and
horseback, even 100 years into the future.
* buggy: (말 한 필이 끄는) 마차
① underestimated the rate of progress of science
② overly depended on high-technology machines
③ tended to indulge in dreams ahead of their time
④ preferred air transportation to land transportation
⑤ put emphasis on the commercial aspect of science
30. If I could give you only a single piece of advice from my
life-long experience in the movie industry, it would be to
. The
process of learning how to make a movie is cyclical, meaning
you have to go through the entire process at least once just to
begin to understand the craft. For example, much of directing
stems from understanding the editing process and the way
shots work together to make a scene. Understanding just this
one aspect will have a huge impact on your choices for camera
placement and pacing when directing on set. Don’t turn your
star idea into your first film; you will regret it for your entire
career. Start small and learn the process with a short film; then
with the second and third films, develop your craft of directing,
working with actors and directing the camera. You will know
when you are ready to take on a feature film.
① abandon the ideas that cannot guarantee your success
②make use of as much special equipment as possible
③ produce short films before making a feature film
④ understand the psychology shown in the films
⑤ give an effort to write your own scenario

The theories of science are not fixed; rather, they undergo
change. Scientific theories evolve as they go through stages of
redefinition and refinement. During the past hundred years,
for example, the theory of the atom has been repeatedly
refined as new evidence on atomic behavior has been
gathered. (A) , chemists have refined their view of
the way molecules bond together, and biologists have refined
the cell theory. The refinement of theories is a strength of
science, not a weakness. Many people feel that it is a sign of
weakness to change their minds. Competent scientists are
ready to change their minds at any time. (B) ,
they don’t change their minds at any time. They do that only
when they are confronted with solid experimental evidence or
when a conceptually simpler hypothesis forces them to a new
point of view. More important than defending beliefs is
improving them.

① Similarly …… However
② Similarly …… For instance
③ As a result …… In other words
④ Nevertheless …… Consequently
⑤ Nevertheless …… In contrast


37. The Postclassical Period에 대한다음글의내용과일치하는것은?
World historians increasingly use the term The Postclassical
Period for the crucial period from the years 500 to 1450. This
period was set by the collapse of the Roman Empire and the
classical empires in Asia. Two large themes define this period.
First, the period saw the spread of the three major religions—
Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Second, the pace and impact
of international trade accelerated. The Indian Ocean became the
key route for world trade. Dramatic innovations in religion and
trade, then, set the tone for the period. Every society in
Afro-Eurasia had to react to these new forces, though their
reactions varied. In the process, world history gradually changed
from an emphasis on the separate development of key societies
to the interaction among key societies. The period thus
constitutes one of the crucial transitions in the human past.

38. Herta Müller에 대한 다음 글의 내용과일치하지 않는 것은?
The 2009 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to
Romanian-born German author Herta Müller, a distinct and
compelling voice of opposition against political oppression and
the anguish of human existence. Known primarily as a novelist,
Müller also wrote a lot of works as a short-story writer, poet,
and essayist. Her works portrayed the harsh reality of life in
Romania. Although she was highly regarded by those who read
her, Müller was limited to a German-speaking audience for
much of her career. She was the 12th woman to receive the
Nobel Prize for Literature and the first German writer to win
since 1999, when the award was presented to Günter Grass.
Criticizing all forms of totalitarian rule, she was drawn to those
who were abused by authority.
①루마니아태생의독일작가이다.
②소설가로주로알려졌지만시인이기도했다.
③작품에서루마니아의평온한삶을묘사했다.
④노벨문학상을수상한열두번째여성이었다.
⑤모든형태의전체주의통치를비판했다.

39. Some sport-food advertising implies that since minerals are
removed from your body by sporting activities, you need their
specific foods that have those nutrients. However, general
recreational exercise does not sufficiently deplete any
nutrients to affect athletic ability or health. For that reason,
after a one-hour hike or game of tennis, you don’t need to
replace specific minerals immediately. Your next good meal will
cover you. It is unnecessary to take extra minerals ahead of
time to prepare for any loss predicted during your exercise.
You don’t lose enough to affect performance or fatigue level.
Regular healthy eating and drinking enough water assures that
you don’t start your day in an already depleted state.
Minute-to-minute deficits don’t matter as much.

40. You know who the popular kids are at school, what they are
thinking about and saying, and who and what impresses them.
Is that right? The more important question is, do you know the
same things about you? What are you thinking about and
saying, and who and what impresses you? You may not think
much about self-awareness, but it is essential. If you don’t
know yourself, you could be swayed by what others think you
should be, think, and do. That can interfere with your ability to
make smart decisions and accomplish what you want in life. So,
be a little self-centered! This doesn’t mean being greedy or
calling attention to yourself for no reason. It just means adding
yourself to the list of people you want to impress.

41. Many ships stay steady because weight is added to the hull.
This weight is called ballast. Ships usually use water as ballast.
Ballast water is very useful for ships. But it can cause
problems, too. Water pumped into the ship at a port may have
plant or animal species living in it. When the ship arrives at
another port and dumps ballast water, those species are
unloaded, too. But they can harm the native species already
living there. One example of an animal that can cause problems
if brought to a new area is the spiny water flea. This tiny
animal breeds quickly, and it eats the same food that many
young fish eat. When the spiny water flea enters a new area, if
the native fish cannot get enough food, they die. To help solve
this kind of problem, some nations ask ships to follow certain
rules when pumping ballast water.

42. Companies once provided not only economic security but
social identity. Many towns were literally company towns, with
a few big corporations providing most of the employment, and
the social and economic infrastructure built around them. You
were a company man, identifying with the company and often
moving largely in the circles created or dictated by it.
However, people don’t stay tied to companies anymore. Instead
of moving up through the ranks of one organization, they move
laterally from company to company in search of what they
want. The playing field is horizontal and people are always on
the move. Now workers have traded security and stability that
companies used to provide for greater autonomy, often
accepting far greater levels of personal exposure and risk.

② Lifestyle in the Interdependent Global Societies
③Optimistic Expectations for the New Labor Market
④ Private Company: Oppressor or Advocate to Laborers?

For most dictionaries, objectivity relates to what is
external to the mind rather than belonging to the
consciousness of the perceiver; relates to outward things,
uncolored by feelings or opinions.
(A) This distancing is not the same as removing all value
judgements from a report. Instead, it requires that the fact
and opinion in a news report needs to be that of people
other than the journalist.
(B) However, objectivity does not mean this to most
journalists. Essentially, to file an objective report a
journalist needs to distance him or herself from the truth
claims of the report.
(C) For this reason, columns, editorials and other forms of
news analysis will never qualify as objective reporting: the
voice of the journalist is either too loud or too central for
them to be objective.

With recent switch from analogue to digital television, however,
much of this protective white-space is no longer needed.
‘White-space’ is technical slang for television channels that
were left vacant in one city so as not to interfere with TV
stations broadcasting on adjacent channels in a neighboring city.
( ① ) In the early days of television, America’s broadcasting
authorities reserved 50 or so channels for TV stations. ( ② )
But because of worries about interference, no metropolitan area
has ever come close to using all 50 channels at its disposal.
( ③ ) In rural areas, vacant channels have frequently amounted
to 70% or more of the total bandwidth available for television
broadcasting. ( ④ ) This is because digital signals do not
interfere with one another and can therefore be packed closer
together. ( ⑤ ) All told, the television networks now require
little more than half the frequency spectrum they needed
previously.

An experiment done on men in North Carolina shows
how helpless we can be in the face of praise. The men in
the study received comments about themselves from
another person who needed a favor from them. Some of
the men got only positive comments, some got only
negative comments, and some got a mixture of good and
bad. There were three interesting findings. First, the
evaluator who provided only praise was liked best by the
men. Second, this was the case even though the men fully
realized that the flatterer stood to gain from their liking
him. Finally, unlike the other types of comments, pure
praise did not have to be accurate to work. Positive
comments produced just as much liking for the flatterer
when they were untrue as when they were true.
In an experiment on reactions to praise, it was found that the
most (A) person was the one who had given praise

(A)
Charles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New York
City, was assigned to prepare a report on a certain
corporation. He knew of only one man who possessed the
facts he needed so urgently. The man was Mr. Smith,
president of a large industrial company. Charles went to see
the president to ask for help. As Charles was ushered into
(a) his office, a young woman stuck her head through a door
and told the president that she didn’t have any stamps for
him that day.
(B)
The next afternoon he called on Mr. Smith and said that he
had some stamps for his son. Was Charles ushered in with
enthusiasm? Yes. Mr. Smith couldn’t have shaken his hand
with more enthusiasm if he had been running for Congress.
He radiated smiles and good will. “My George will love this
one,” he kept saying as (b) he handled the stamps. “And look
at this! This is treasure.”
(C)
Charles spent half an hour talking with Mr. Smith about
stamps and looking at the picture of his boy. Mr. Smith then
devoted more than an hour to giving every bit of information
Charles wanted. He told Charles all (c) he knew, and then
called in his employees and questioned them. He telephoned
some of his associates. He loaded Charles down with facts,
figures, and reports. In the journalists’ term, Charles had a
scoop.
(D)
Mr. Smith explained to Charles that (d) he was collecting
stamps for his twelve-year-old son. Charles stated his

Norms may be cultural, but traffic can also create its own
culture. Consider the case of jaywalking in New York City
and Copenhagen. In both places, jaywalking, or crossing
against the light, is technically prohibited. In both places,
people have been ticketed for doing it. But the visitor to
either city today will witness a shocking study in contrast. In
New York City, where the term jaywalking was popularized,
waiting for the signal is now a sign that you are from the
countryside. By contrast, the average Copenhagen resident
seems to have hostility to people crossing against the light.
It is tempting to attribute the differences to culture. In
New York City, a melting pot of different traditions and a
hotbed of individualism, jaywalking is a way to distinguish
yourself from the crowd and get ahead. Pedestrians look at
cars, not lights. Jaywalking also helps relieve overcrowded
intersections. In Copenhagen, which historically has had a
more community-focused population, jaywalking is an act of
bad taste, an unnecessary departure from the harmony that
sustains communities. Waiting for the light to change, like
waiting for spring, seems a test of the cold Scandinavian
soul. A Danish-Norwegian novelist described a set of laws
inspired by the small Danish town where he was raised.
They all basically had the same theme: Do not think you are
better than anyone else. These laws are still popular
shorthand toward explaining the relative social nature of
Scandinavian societies, and it is not hard to imagine them
applied to traffic. Jaywalking, like speeding or excessive lane
changing, is just a form of self-centeredness that disrupts
.
