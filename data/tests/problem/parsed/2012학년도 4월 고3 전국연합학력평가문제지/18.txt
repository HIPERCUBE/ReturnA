The City Animal Shelter continues displaying ‘cool city pets’
for adoption every third Saturday of the month beginning this
year on January 15. Between the hours of 1 and 3 p.m.,
potential adopters can get acquainted with the many small
animals available for adoption from the shelter, located at 2061
15th Ave. Available small animals include hamsters, rabbits,
guinea pigs, rats and mice. Volunteer small-animal specialists
are on hand to help adopters find the right pet for them. They
provide information about each animal’s characteristics and
needs, demonstrate basic care and handling skills, and answer
questions. All ages are welcome, but children must be
accompanied by an adult. If you would like more information or
directions, please visit the shelter’s website.
