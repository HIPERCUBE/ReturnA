34. Museums have been the primary contemporary institutions
upholding classical standards of artistic value. Recently,
however, many philosophers have described the dilemma
museums face in identifying their chief function: as storage
places of valuable objects, or instead, as places to produce
interesting experiences. The aims of scholarship and
preservation of real objects are being displaced by an emphasis
on virtual experiences and emotional rhetoric. Museums are
decorated as entertainment palaces at the Disneyland, when
they add jazzy modes of presentation, audio-phone tapes,
fancy displays with buttons and videos, mega-gift shops, etc.
The Pompidou Centre was revolutionary and attracted many
kinds of people with add-ons such as cafes, restaurants,
bookstores, theaters, a film section, etc.
