25. A political scientist has done a series of experiments to
demonstrate the positive effects of . In those
experiments, he used computer-simulated agents that were
programmed to solve problems. He set up a series of groups of
ten or twenty agents, with each agent endowed with a different
set of skills, and had them solve a relatively sophisticated
problem. Individually, some of the agents were very good at
solving the problem while others were less effective. But what
he found was that a group made up of some smart agents and
some not-so-smart agents almost always did better than a
group made up just of smart agents. You could do as well or
better by selecting a group randomly and letting it solve the
problem as by spending a lot of time trying to find the smart
agents and then putting them alone on the problem. [3점]
