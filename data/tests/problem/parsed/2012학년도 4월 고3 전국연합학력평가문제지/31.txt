The theories of science are not fixed; rather, they undergo
change. Scientific theories evolve as they go through stages of
redefinition and refinement. During the past hundred years,
for example, the theory of the atom has been repeatedly
refined as new evidence on atomic behavior has been
gathered. (A) , chemists have refined their view of
the way molecules bond together, and biologists have refined
the cell theory. The refinement of theories is a strength of
science, not a weakness. Many people feel that it is a sign of
weakness to change their minds. Competent scientists are
ready to change their minds at any time. (B) ,
they don’t change their minds at any time. They do that only
when they are confronted with solid experimental evidence or
when a conceptually simpler hypothesis forces them to a new
point of view. More important than defending beliefs is
improving them.
