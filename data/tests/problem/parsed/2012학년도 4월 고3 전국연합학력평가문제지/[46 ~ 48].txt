(A)
Charles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New York
City, was assigned to prepare a report on a certain
corporation. He knew of only one man who possessed the
facts he needed so urgently. The man was Mr. Smith,
president of a large industrial company. Charles went to see
the president to ask for help. As Charles was ushered into
(a) his office, a young woman stuck her head through a door
and told the president that she didn’t have any stamps for
him that day.
(B)
The next afternoon he called on Mr. Smith and said that he
had some stamps for his son. Was Charles ushered in with
enthusiasm? Yes. Mr. Smith couldn’t have shaken his hand
with more enthusiasm if he had been running for Congress.
He radiated smiles and good will. “My George will love this
one,” he kept saying as (b) he handled the stamps. “And look
at this! This is treasure.”
(C)
Charles spent half an hour talking with Mr. Smith about
stamps and looking at the picture of his boy. Mr. Smith then
devoted more than an hour to giving every bit of information
Charles wanted. He told Charles all (c) he knew, and then
called in his employees and questioned them. He telephoned
some of his associates. He loaded Charles down with facts,
figures, and reports. In the journalists’ term, Charles had a
scoop.
(D)
Mr. Smith explained to Charles that (d) he was collecting
stamps for his twelve-year-old son. Charles stated his
mission, and began asking questions. Mr. Smith didn’t want
to talk. The first interview with Mr. Smith was brief and
barren. Then Charles remembered what the secretary had
said to Mr. Smith— stamps. And (e) he also recalled that the
foreign department of his bank collected stamps taken from
letters pouring in from all over the world.
