41. Many ships stay steady because weight is added to the hull.
This weight is called ballast. Ships usually use water as ballast.
Ballast water is very useful for ships. But it can cause
problems, too. Water pumped into the ship at a port may have
plant or animal species living in it. When the ship arrives at
another port and dumps ballast water, those species are
unloaded, too. But they can harm the native species already
living there. One example of an animal that can cause problems
if brought to a new area is the spiny water flea. This tiny
animal breeds quickly, and it eats the same food that many
young fish eat. When the spiny water flea enters a new area, if
the native fish cannot get enough food, they die. To help solve
this kind of problem, some nations ask ships to follow certain
rules when pumping ballast water.
