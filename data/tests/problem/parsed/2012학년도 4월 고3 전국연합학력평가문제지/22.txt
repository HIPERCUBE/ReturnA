A mountain floats on the Earth’s semiliquid mantle with only
its tip showing. So, like floating icebergs, mountains are deeper
than they are high. From this fact comes another interesting
fact about mountains. ① If you could shave off the top of an
iceberg, the iceberg would be lighter and would be raised to
nearly its original height before being shaved. ② Likewise,
when mountains erode, they are lighter, and they are pushed
from below to float to nearly their original heights. ③A method
of computing the heights of mountains from sea level became
popular among many scientists. ④ So, when a kilometer of
mountain erodes away, some 85% of a kilometer of mountain
pushes up from below. ⑤That is why it takes so long for
mountains to weather away.
