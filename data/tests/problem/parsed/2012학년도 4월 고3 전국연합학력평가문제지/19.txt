19. 밑줄친 her가 가리키는 대상이 나머지넷과 다른 것은?
It was a long day, which included picking up her son. At
6:30 p.m., Jane found herself at the local grocery store
helping him with his homework. After unloading their cart at
the checkout, Jane realized to her utter embarrassment that
① her wallet was not in the purse. Without any hesitation,
the checkout lady in front of ② her said, “Put it through. I’ll
take care of it.” Jane was shocked and hesitated, but the lady
insisted. Jane asked about how to pay ③ her back and the
lady said, “You can leave it with the staff in an envelope for
Ann Shirley.” She didn’t ask for ④ her name or phone number
― not a thing. Jane and ⑤ her son were amazed. It was a
lovely gift to start off the new year. She reminded them that
life is too short not to lend a helping hand when the
opportunity arises.
