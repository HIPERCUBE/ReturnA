With recent switch from analogue to digital television, however,
much of this protective white-space is no longer needed.
‘White-space’ is technical slang for television channels that
were left vacant in one city so as not to interfere with TV
stations broadcasting on adjacent channels in a neighboring city.
( ① ) In the early days of television, America’s broadcasting
authorities reserved 50 or so channels for TV stations. ( ② )
But because of worries about interference, no metropolitan area
has ever come close to using all 50 channels at its disposal.
( ③ ) In rural areas, vacant channels have frequently amounted
to 70% or more of the total bandwidth available for television
broadcasting. ( ④ ) This is because digital signals do not
interfere with one another and can therefore be packed closer
together. ( ⑤ ) All told, the television networks now require
little more than half the frequency spectrum they needed
previously.
