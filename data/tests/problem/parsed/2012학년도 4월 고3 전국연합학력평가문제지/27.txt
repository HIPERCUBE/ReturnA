27. I do have a problem with each social network being ,
and while there is some cross-functionality, they are not
playing with one another as seamlessly as many of us would
like. Think about that in comparison with email: You can email
anyone else with an email address. It does not matter that you
are on Gmail and the other person is on Hotmail. Because email
was developed as an open system that was not market driven,
standards were developed to ensure that different systems
could talk to one another. That is not the case with social
networks. If I am only on MySpace, and you are only on
Facebook, we cannot interact. Additionally, if one of those
services goes down or goes away, we are kind of stuck—we
have to move on to another service and start all over.
