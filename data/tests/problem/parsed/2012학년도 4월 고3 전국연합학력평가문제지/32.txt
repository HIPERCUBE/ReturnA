There are two categories of values: intrinsic and instrumental.
Intrinsic values are those we uphold regardless of the benefits
or costs. Patriotism, as a value, demands sacrifices and is
sometimes ① advantageous as far as individual well-being is
concerned. Nevertheless, hundreds of millions of people have
died to ② defend their country throughout the course of
history, because patriotism is an intrinsic value. In contrast, a
value is instrumental when we support it because it is directly
③ beneficial to us. Let us assume that a country is dedicated
to economic growth and to this end emphasizes work,
productivity, and investment. If decisions favorable to
development only answer to an instrumental value of an
economic nature, such as increased wealth, the country’s effort
will ④ decline as soon as the degree of wealth is attained. That
is why the intrinsic values are ⑤ indispensable for sustained
development.
