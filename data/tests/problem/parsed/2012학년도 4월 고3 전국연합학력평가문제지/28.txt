28. There is a story that Galileo dropped two different weights
off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which may or may not be true.
But we do know that Galileo was very clever in the way he
measured how things fall. When Galileo lived, about 400 years
ago, there were no watches or clocks. Any falling object fell
too fast for him to measure how long it took. So, Galileo
decided to slow down falling objects. Instead of dropping
objects off buildings, he decided to roll balls down a ramp. He
figured that the same force that made things fall would make
balls roll down a ramp. This force is called gravity. A ramp
would make it easier to . He measured
the time by catching drops of water while a ball rolled. He
could change the steepness of the ramp and measure the
distance the ball traveled while water dripped. The steepest
ramp was very close to a free fall.

① throw a ball high ② see gravity in action
③ balance the weights ④ speed up falling objects
⑤measure the steepness
