40. You know who the popular kids are at school, what they are
thinking about and saying, and who and what impresses them.
Is that right? The more important question is, do you know the
same things about you? What are you thinking about and
saying, and who and what impresses you? You may not think
much about self-awareness, but it is essential. If you don’t
know yourself, you could be swayed by what others think you
should be, think, and do. That can interfere with your ability to
make smart decisions and accomplish what you want in life. So,
be a little self-centered! This doesn’t mean being greedy or
calling attention to yourself for no reason. It just means adding
yourself to the list of people you want to impress.
