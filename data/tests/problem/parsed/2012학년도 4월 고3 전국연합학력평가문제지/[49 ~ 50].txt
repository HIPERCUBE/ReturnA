Norms may be cultural, but traffic can also create its own
culture. Consider the case of jaywalking in New York City
and Copenhagen. In both places, jaywalking, or crossing
against the light, is technically prohibited. In both places,
people have been ticketed for doing it. But the visitor to
either city today will witness a shocking study in contrast. In
New York City, where the term jaywalking was popularized,
waiting for the signal is now a sign that you are from the
countryside. By contrast, the average Copenhagen resident
seems to have hostility to people crossing against the light.
It is tempting to attribute the differences to culture. In
New York City, a melting pot of different traditions and a
hotbed of individualism, jaywalking is a way to distinguish
yourself from the crowd and get ahead. Pedestrians look at
cars, not lights. Jaywalking also helps relieve overcrowded
intersections. In Copenhagen, which historically has had a
more community-focused population, jaywalking is an act of
bad taste, an unnecessary departure from the harmony that
sustains communities. Waiting for the light to change, like
waiting for spring, seems a test of the cold Scandinavian
soul. A Danish-Norwegian novelist described a set of laws
inspired by the small Danish town where he was raised.
They all basically had the same theme: Do not think you are
better than anyone else. These laws are still popular
shorthand toward explaining the relative social nature of
Scandinavian societies, and it is not hard to imagine them
applied to traffic. Jaywalking, like speeding or excessive lane
changing, is just a form of self-centeredness that disrupts
