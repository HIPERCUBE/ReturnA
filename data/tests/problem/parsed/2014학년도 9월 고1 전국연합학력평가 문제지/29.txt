29. 밑줄 친 he[him]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
A newly retired executive was bothered when no one 
called ① him anymore. His list of calls to return, 
previously pages long, had vanished altogether. The 
younger man who replaced him at the office had politely 
declined his offer of a lunch date, claiming ② he was 
mastering the job “just fine.” This 68‒year‒old man was 
the same person ③ he had been six months earlier, but no 
one sought him out after his retirement. One day, a friend 
encouraged him to serve as a crossing guard for the 
elementary school, pointing out that ④ he seemed to be 
getting more and more depressed and was sleeping in later 
and later. Skilled in signaling the oncoming cars and 
getting them to halt yards before the white lines, ⑤ he 
began taking on a straighter posture and a more confident 
gaze. Then he had found a compelling reason to get out of 
bed in the morning.
