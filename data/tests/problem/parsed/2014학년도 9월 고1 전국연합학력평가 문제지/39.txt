It’s also possible that they will absorb the wrong lesson, 
and regard thank‒you notes as piecework, a burden to be 
performed for pay. 
A friend of mine used to pay his young children $1 each 
time they wrote a thank‒you note. ( ① ) This policy may 
or may not work in the long run. ( ② ) It might turn out 
that, by writing enough thank‒you notes, the children will 
eventually learn the real point of them and continue to 
express gratitude for gifts, even when they are no longer 
paid to do so. ( ③ ) In this case, the habit won’t take, and 
they will stop writing such notes once they are no longer 
paid. ( ④ ) Worse, the bribes may corrupt their moral 
education and make it harder for them to learn the virtue of 
gratitude. ( ⑤ ) Even if it increases production in the short 
run, the bribe for thank‒you notes will have failed, by 
inculcating the wrong way of valuing the good in question.
