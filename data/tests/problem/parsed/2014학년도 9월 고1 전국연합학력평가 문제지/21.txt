Over time, I have become increasingly aware that the world 
is divided into people who wait for others to give them 
permission to do the things they want to do and people who 
grant themselves permission. Some look inside themselves for 
motivation and others wait to be pushed forward by outside 
forces. From my experience, there is a lot to be said for 
seizing opportunities instead of waiting for someone to hand 
them to you. There are always white spaces ready to be 
filled and golden nuggets of opportunities lying on the ground 
waiting for someone to pick them up. Sometimes it means 
looking beyond your own desk, outside your building, across 
the street, or around the corner. But the nuggets are there 
for the taking by anyone willing to gather them up.
