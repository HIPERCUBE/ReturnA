32. According to Richard Thaler’s theory, people value an 
object more if                          . In a classic study, 
people were asked to assess the value of coffee cups which 
had been gifted to them. Another group in the study was 
also asked to estimate the value of coffee cups, but these 
coffee cups were not owned by anyone. The subjects who 
owned their coffee cups consistently valued them higher than 
the other subjects, and in some cases they said that they 
would prefer to keep their coffee cups, even if they were 
offered money for them. However, it seems to apply 
specifically to objects. When people in a similar study were 
offered tokens which could be exchanged for coffee cups, the 
cognitive bias was not observed, suggesting that people 
formed an attachment to the specific object, not to an 
abstract concept. [3점]
