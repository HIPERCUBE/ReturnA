(A)
Early in her life as a fund raiser, Lynne Twist was 
asked to go to a large corporation to meet the CEO, 
Ricardo Aguirre. (a) She was working for “The Hunger 
Project” whose goal was to bring an end to hunger around 
the world. She was nervous about meeting the CEO 
because his company had a poor reputation. He was going 
to make a large donation to the project as a way of 
rectifying its poor record. 
(B)
The pastor had invited (b) her to speak about “The 
Hunger Project.” Although it was raining and the room was 
leaking, 75 people were waiting for her. She began her 
talk, wondering how she could ask these people to give, 
when their own need was so great! Then a woman stood, 
eagerly saying she was going to give the 75 dollars (c) she 
had earned that week. Deeply moved, Lynne placed the 
check in the same briefcase where she had earlier placed 
the huge check from the CEO. One after another, people 
followed the woman’s lead and put in their contributions.

(C)
Later that evening, Lynne decided to write a letter to 
the CEO. (d) She appreciated his contribution and then said 
she would return the check because it did not come from 
his heart. Four years later, Lynne received a letter from 
that CEO. He said that he had been deeply affected by her 
letter years earlier, and he wanted to send her another 
contribution, but this one was from his heart. There was a 
check for $250,000 in the envelope!
(D)
Lynne arrived at the company and took the elevator to the 
top floor. She felt scared. Lynne arrived at his large office 
and sat at a long conference table with him on the other 
end. She gave her talk within the 15‒minute time limit given 
to her, and he presented her with an envelope. Inside was a 
check for $50,000, which was the largest single donation she 
had ever raised. (e) She thanked him, yet deep down, she 
felt unsettled. Lynne then went on to meet with a church 
group in their basement meeting room in Harlem.
