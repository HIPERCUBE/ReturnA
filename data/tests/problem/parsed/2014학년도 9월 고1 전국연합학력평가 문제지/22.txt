It’s true that before puberty, kids don’t gain the same 
muscle from lifting weights that a teen or adult would, but 
Dr. Avery Faigenbaum, a noted youth exercise specialist, 
points to studies in which children as young as six have 
benefited from strength training and says that, on average, 
kids show a 30 to 40 percent strength gain when they start 
lifting for the first time. Muscles aren’t the only goal, of 
course; various studies have also shown that kids who 
weight‒train have healthier bone density, body composition, 
and even resistance to injury. The risk of injury is, of 
course, one reason parents worry about kids and weights, 
but as long as the little bodybuilders are properly supervised 
to prevent overtraining and possible injury, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics and the President’s Council on 
Fitness say the rewards outweigh the risks.
