A recent study from Germany proved that hearing the 
words “This is going to hurt” before we get a shot 
triggers the pain response in our brains ― we actually feel 
pain before the needle even touches the skin! Researchers 
used functional MRI to study people’s brains and found 
that their pain centers lit up like pinball machines when 
they heard words that suggested intense pain was coming.
What this tells us is that words matter. When we say or 
listen to words conveying negative or painful thoughts or 
feelings, our brains immediately activate to feel that pain. 
In some ways, this is an amazingly human trait ― we are 
very empathetic creatures. But there are situations where 
that compassion ― even for ourselves ― might cause 
problems. When a person with chronic pain talks about her 
pain with a support group, the close relationships and 
understanding she finds there are certain to help her. But 
if during those meetings, she “shares” how she’s been 
struggling, might she actually be reinforcing that pain in 
herself and others? It’s certainly a valid question.
Whatever the answer is, this area of research 
demonstrates one thing clearly: We have a tremendous 
ability to control our own health destinies simply by   
our internal dialogue. Consider this chain of 
events: Think positive thoughts. Say positive words. 
Surround yourself with positive people. What will happen? 
Your body will eagerly drink in all the corresponding health 
benefits such as lower blood pressure and lower levels of 
stress hormones.
