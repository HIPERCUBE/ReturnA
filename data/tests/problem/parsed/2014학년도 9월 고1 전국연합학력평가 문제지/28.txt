It’s no surprise that labels are becoming the “go to” 
place when people have questions about how food is 
produced. But new Cornell University research finds that 
consumers crave more information, especially for the 
potentially (A) harmful / harmless  ingredients that aren’t 
included in the product. The laboratory study of 351 
shoppers found consumers willing to pay a premium when a 
product label says “free of” something, but only if the 
package provides “negative” information on whatever the 
product is “free of.” For example, a food labeled “free” of a 
food dye will compel some consumers to buy that product. 
But even more people will buy that product if that same label 
(B) includes / excludes  information about the risks of 
ingesting such dyes. “When they get more information about 
ingredients, consumers are more (C) confident / insecure  
about their decisions and value the product more,” Harry M. 
Kaiser, a Cornell professor, said.
