This simple realization is relevant not only to friends in 
real life, but also to followers on social media websites.
Are your friends more popular than you are? ( ① ) There 
doesn’t seem to be any obvious reason to suppose this is 
true, but it probably is. ( ② ) At work or school, we are 
all more likely to become friends with someone who has a 
lot of friends than we are to befriend someone with few 
friends. ( ③ ) It’s not that we avoid co-workers and 
classmates with few friends; rather it’s more probable that 
we will be among a popular person’s friends simply because 
he or she has a large number of them. ( ④ ) In Twitter, 
for example, it gives rise to what might be called the 
follower paradox: most people have fewer followers than 
their followers do. ( ⑤ ) Before you resolve to become 
more popular, remember that most people are in similar, 
sparsely populated boats.
