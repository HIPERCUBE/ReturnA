I have been a subscriber to your magazine for about 15 
years. Your recent article on air pollution, which mentioned 
Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley of California, was 
essentially correct. However, it may have given the 
impression that Fresno is unlivable, which is far from the 
truth. The city is home to 500,000 living, breathing citizens, 
and the county some 900,000 souls. We are not all 
suffering. I ride my bike nearly every day and have yet to 
suffer any ill effects despite being well beyond retirement 
age. We are close to Yosemite and Sequoia national parks, a 
number of mountain lakes and rivers, and the Pacific Ocean 
is easily accessible. So contrary to the impression left by 
some writers, we Fresnans are not all suffering in some hell 
hole.
