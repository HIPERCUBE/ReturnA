27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Suppose, on your wedding day, your best man delivers a 
heart‒warming, moving toast that makes you ①cry. You later 
learn he didn’t write it himself but bought it online. Then, 
would the toast mean less than it ②was at first, before you 
knew it was written by a paid professional? Most people 
would agree the bought wedding toast has less value than an 
authentic ③ one. Although a bought toast might “work” in 
the sense of achieving its desired effect, that effect 
might depend on deception. That is, if you ④purchased a 
moving masterpiece of a toast online, you would probably 
cover it up! If a bought toast depends for its effect on 
concealing its origin, that’s a reason to suspect it’s a corrupt 
version of the real thing. Wedding toasts are goods ⑤that 
can, in a sense, be bought. But buying and selling them 
diminishes their value.
