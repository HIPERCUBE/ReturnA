I have been a subscriber to your magazine for about 15 
years. Your recent article on air pollution, which mentioned 
Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley of California, was 
essentially correct. However, it may have given the 
impression that Fresno is unlivable, which is far from the 
truth. The city is home to 500,000 living, breathing citizens, 
and the county some 900,000 souls. We are not all 
suffering. I ride my bike nearly every day and have yet to 
suffer any ill effects despite being well beyond retirement 
age. We are close to Yosemite and Sequoia national parks, a 
number of mountain lakes and rivers, and the Pacific Ocean 
is easily accessible. So contrary to the impression left by 
some writers, we Fresnans are not all suffering in some hell 
hole.

19. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Most people don’t assess their roles frequently enough and 
so stay in positions for years longer than they should, 
settling for suboptimal situations. There isn’t a magic 
number for the amount of time you should stay in one role 
before evaluating whether it’s right or not. But it makes 
sense to think about how often you do. Some people 
readjust their lives daily or weekly, constantly optimizing. 
Others wait years before noticing that they’ve ended up far 
from where they had hoped to be. The more frequently you 
assess your situation, looking for ways to fix problems, the 
more likely you are to find yourself in a position where 
things are going well.

② 구체적인 계획을 세워 시행착오를 줄여라.

⑤ 자신의 상황을 자주 평가하고 삶을 재조정해라.
20. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
The initial stages of a relationship ― courtship, marriage, 
honeymoon ― are usually relatively conflict‒free. But then, 
while the couple is together, there is conflict. To many, 
conflict within a relationship means that the relationship 
itself is in trouble; perfect harmony ― the absence of 
conflict ― is considered the standard we should all strive for. 
As it turns out, conflict is not only unavoidable but actually 
crucial for the long‒term success of the relationship. Think 
of conflicts as a form of vaccine. When we immunize against 
a disease, we are in fact injecting a weakened strain of the 
disease into the body, which is then stimulated to develop 
the antibodies that enable it to deal with more major 
assaults later on. Likewise, minor conflicts help our 
relationship develop defense capabilities; they immunize the 
relationship and help partners deal with major gridlocks 
when they arise.                        
* gridlock: 교착 상태

21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Over time, I have become increasingly aware that the world 
is divided into people who wait for others to give them 
permission to do the things they want to do and people who 
grant themselves permission. Some look inside themselves for 
motivation and others wait to be pushed forward by outside 
forces. From my experience, there is a lot to be said for 
seizing opportunities instead of waiting for someone to hand 
them to you. There are always white spaces ready to be 
filled and golden nuggets of opportunities lying on the ground 
waiting for someone to pick them up. Sometimes it means 
looking beyond your own desk, outside your building, across 
the street, or around the corner. But the nuggets are there 
for the taking by anyone willing to gather them up.
① Be Motivated by People Around You
② Why Do Golden Nuggets Distract Us?
③ Don’t Hesitate to Take Hold of Opportunities
④ How Can We Easily Get Permission from Others?
⑤ Widen Your Eyes, Deepen Your Understanding of Others  
22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
It’s true that before puberty, kids don’t gain the same 
muscle from lifting weights that a teen or adult would, but 
Dr. Avery Faigenbaum, a noted youth exercise specialist, 
points to studies in which children as young as six have 
benefited from strength training and says that, on average, 
kids show a 30 to 40 percent strength gain when they start 
lifting for the first time. Muscles aren’t the only goal, of 
course; various studies have also shown that kids who 
weight‒train have healthier bone density, body composition, 
and even resistance to injury. The risk of injury is, of 
course, one reason parents worry about kids and weights, 
but as long as the little bodybuilders are properly supervised 
to prevent overtraining and possible injury, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics and the President’s Council on 
Fitness say the rewards outweigh the risks.
① workout tips for muscle building
② ways to prevent injury while exercising
③ merits of lifting weights at a young age
④ reasons why kids have to exercise outside
⑤ advantages of warming up before lifting weights

Suppose, on your wedding day, your best man delivers a 
heart‒warming, moving toast that makes you ①cry. You later 
learn he didn’t write it himself but bought it online. Then, 
would the toast mean less than it ②was at first, before you 
knew it was written by a paid professional? Most people 
would agree the bought wedding toast has less value than an 
authentic ③ one. Although a bought toast might “work” in 
the sense of achieving its desired effect, that effect 
might depend on deception. That is, if you ④purchased a 
moving masterpiece of a toast online, you would probably 
cover it up! If a bought toast depends for its effect on 
concealing its origin, that’s a reason to suspect it’s a corrupt 
version of the real thing. Wedding toasts are goods ⑤that 
can, in a sense, be bought. But buying and selling them 
diminishes their value.
* toast: 축사
32. According to Richard Thaler’s theory, people value an 
object more if                          . In a classic study, 
people were asked to assess the value of coffee cups which 
had been gifted to them. Another group in the study was 
also asked to estimate the value of coffee cups, but these 
coffee cups were not owned by anyone. The subjects who 
owned their coffee cups consistently valued them higher than 
the other subjects, and in some cases they said that they 
would prefer to keep their coffee cups, even if they were 
offered money for them. However, it seems to apply 
specifically to objects. When people in a similar study were 
offered tokens which could be exchanged for coffee cups, the 
cognitive bias was not observed, suggesting that people 
formed an attachment to the specific object, not to an 
abstract concept. [3점]   
① it is a special edition
② the object is expensive
③ its brand name is popular
④ others consider the object valuable
⑤ their ownership is clearly established

We have evolved the capacity to care for other people, 
animals and things.     (A)    , if children are hurt, parents 
often know that rationalizing with them is not enough. The 
children will often need a cuddle and a bit of tender loving 
care. We recognize that other people often need looking 
after and caring for, and we have evolved the capacity to do 
this within our brains. We can empathize with others and 
feel sad for them and often want to help them.     (B)    , 
in depression, we often lose this inner capability. We often 
fail to look after or nurture ourselves, and we may not even 
recognize that we need to become more inwardly caring. To 
heal often means we have to learn to reactivate the caring‒
healing part of ourselves that depression has knocked out.

34. 다음 글의 마지막 부분에 드러난 Sharyn의 심경으로 가장 
적절한 것은?
Because no plane, train or car could accommodate Sharyn’s 
delicate health needs, she had no other choice but to stay 
home while the rest of the family attended her son’s 
wedding without her. They left her with tender promises to 
remember all the details, to take lots and lots of pictures, 
and to save her some wedding cake. During her family’s 
absence, caregivers took care of her meals and personal 
needs, but Sharyn couldn’t shake off her blues and feelings 
of isolation. It wasn’t easy finding herself apart from her 
family at Christmas and missing the festivities of her son’s 
wedding. The hurt followed her as surely as the oxygen 
tube trailing her wheelchair.
① gloomy and lonely ② scared and worried   
③ restless and excited ④ bored and indifferent 
⑤ shocked and surprised

35. When the Muslims invaded southern Europe in the eighth 
century, they passed a law forbidding the sale of pork. This 
was done because the founder of the Muslim religion had 
declared pork to be unclean. ① This law, of course, didn’t 
change the Europeans’ love of pork, and there soon developed 
a black market for the meat. ② In secret transactions, usually 
conducted at night, farmers would sell to city dwellers pigs 
concealed in large bags. ③ Occasionally, a dishonest farmer 
would trick a buyer by selling a bag containing not a pig but 
a cat. ④ Pigs were traditionally associated with dirtiness 
because of their habit of rolling around in mud while cats 
were believed to be clean. ⑤ If something went wrong and 
the bag came open during the transaction, this literally “let 
the cat out of the bag” and this is why revealing a secret is 
said to be “letting the cat out of the bag.”
36. Feynman explains that light always takes the path of least 
time from point to point, and he uses the analogy of a 
lifeguard racing along a beach to save a drowning swimmer. 
The lifeguard could run straight to the water’s edge and then 
swim diagonally along the coast and out to sea, but this 
would result in a long time spent swimming, which is slower 
than running on the beach. ① Alternatively, he could run to 
the water’s edge at the point nearest to the swimmer, and 
dive in there. ② But this makes the total distance covered 
longer than it needs to be. ③ In order to save the drowning 
swimmer, the lifeguard needs to be mentally and physically 
prepared to cope with harsh sea conditions. ④ The optimum, 
if his aim is to reach the swimmer as quickly as possible, is 
somewhere in between these two extremes. ⑤ Light, too, 
takes such a path of least time from point to point, which is 
why it bends when passing between different materials. [3점]

You’ll see a good example of science in action every 
time a police car with its siren blaring passes you in the 
street. Everyone knows that the sound changes as it 
passes you. 
(A) Something similar happens with light waves as well as 
other electromagnetic radiation such as X­rays and 
microwaves. Things moving away from you get redder 
while things moving toward you get bluer. 
(B) It’s not that the siren changes its tune but it is because 
of something known as the Doppler Effect. This is 
where the sound waves coming from moving objects get 
squashed or stretched depending on whether something 
is moving toward or away from you.
(C) As a result, this effect is known as red or blue shift. 
You can’t normally notice this effect with light because 
the object has to be moving at huge speeds but you can 
with distant galaxies.

This simple realization is relevant not only to friends in 
real life, but also to followers on social media websites.
Are your friends more popular than you are? ( ① ) There 
doesn’t seem to be any obvious reason to suppose this is 
true, but it probably is. ( ② ) At work or school, we are 
all more likely to become friends with someone who has a 
lot of friends than we are to befriend someone with few 
friends. ( ③ ) It’s not that we avoid co-workers and 
classmates with few friends; rather it’s more probable that 
we will be among a popular person’s friends simply because 
he or she has a large number of them. ( ④ ) In Twitter, 
for example, it gives rise to what might be called the 
follower paradox: most people have fewer followers than 
their followers do. ( ⑤ ) Before you resolve to become 
more popular, remember that most people are in similar, 
sparsely populated boats.

It’s also possible that they will absorb the wrong lesson, 
and regard thank‒you notes as piecework, a burden to be 
performed for pay. 
A friend of mine used to pay his young children $1 each 
time they wrote a thank‒you note. ( ① ) This policy may 
or may not work in the long run. ( ② ) It might turn out 
that, by writing enough thank‒you notes, the children will 
eventually learn the real point of them and continue to 
express gratitude for gifts, even when they are no longer 
paid to do so. ( ③ ) In this case, the habit won’t take, and 
they will stop writing such notes once they are no longer 
paid. ( ④ ) Worse, the bribes may corrupt their moral 
education and make it harder for them to learn the virtue of 
gratitude. ( ⑤ ) Even if it increases production in the short 
run, the bribe for thank‒you notes will have failed, by 
inculcating the wrong way of valuing the good in question.

The human voice can form incredibly different sounds, 
but each individual language contains only a subset of 
potential sound units, or phonemes. One phoneme that 
occurs in only about twenty percent of the world’s 
languages is the ejective consonant, such as [p] or [k]. 
Caleb Everett, an anthropologist, decided to map where 
this sound occurs. He took a sample of 567 languages 
spoken around the world and compared the locations and 
altitudes of those that either contained or ignored ejective 
consonants. Everett discovered that languages that included 
ejective consonants were generally spoken at a higher 
elevation than those that did not. He suggests that the 
sounds are more popular at high altitudes because lower 
air pressure may make it easier to produce the burst of 
air that is a key characteristic of ejective consonants.

A study revealed that     (A)     factors may play a role 
in determining the     (B)     of ejective consonants in 
each language.

A recent study from Germany proved that hearing the 
words “This is going to hurt” before we get a shot 
triggers the pain response in our brains ― we actually feel 
pain before the needle even touches the skin! Researchers 
used functional MRI to study people’s brains and found 
that their pain centers lit up like pinball machines when 
they heard words that suggested intense pain was coming.
What this tells us is that words matter. When we say or 
listen to words conveying negative or painful thoughts or 
feelings, our brains immediately activate to feel that pain. 
In some ways, this is an amazingly human trait ― we are 
very empathetic creatures. But there are situations where 
that compassion ― even for ourselves ― might cause 
problems. When a person with chronic pain talks about her 
pain with a support group, the close relationships and 
understanding she finds there are certain to help her. But 
if during those meetings, she “shares” how she’s been 
struggling, might she actually be reinforcing that pain in 
herself and others? It’s certainly a valid question.
Whatever the answer is, this area of research 
demonstrates one thing clearly: We have a tremendous 
ability to control our own health destinies simply by   
our internal dialogue. Consider this chain of 
events: Think positive thoughts. Say positive words. 
Surround yourself with positive people. What will happen? 
Your body will eagerly drink in all the corresponding health 
benefits such as lower blood pressure and lower levels of 
stress hormones.

(A)
Early in her life as a fund raiser, Lynne Twist was 
asked to go to a large corporation to meet the CEO, 
Ricardo Aguirre. (a) She was working for “The Hunger 
Project” whose goal was to bring an end to hunger around 
the world. She was nervous about meeting the CEO 
because his company had a poor reputation. He was going 
to make a large donation to the project as a way of 
rectifying its poor record. 
(B)
The pastor had invited (b) her to speak about “The 
Hunger Project.” Although it was raining and the room was 
leaking, 75 people were waiting for her. She began her 
talk, wondering how she could ask these people to give, 
when their own need was so great! Then a woman stood, 
eagerly saying she was going to give the 75 dollars (c) she 
had earned that week. Deeply moved, Lynne placed the 
check in the same briefcase where she had earlier placed 
the huge check from the CEO. One after another, people 
followed the woman’s lead and put in their contributions.

(C)
Later that evening, Lynne decided to write a letter to 
the CEO. (d) She appreciated his contribution and then said 
she would return the check because it did not come from 
his heart. Four years later, Lynne received a letter from 
that CEO. He said that he had been deeply affected by her 
letter years earlier, and he wanted to send her another 
contribution, but this one was from his heart. There was a 
check for $250,000 in the envelope!
(D)
Lynne arrived at the company and took the elevator to the 
top floor. She felt scared. Lynne arrived at his large office 
and sat at a long conference table with him on the other 
end. She gave her talk within the 15‒minute time limit given 
to her, and he presented her with an envelope. Inside was a 
check for $50,000, which was the largest single donation she 
had ever raised. (e) She thanked him, yet deep down, she 
felt unsettled. Lynne then went on to meet with a church 
group in their basement meeting room in Harlem.
