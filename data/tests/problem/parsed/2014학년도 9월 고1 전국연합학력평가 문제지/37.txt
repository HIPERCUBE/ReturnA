You’ll see a good example of science in action every 
time a police car with its siren blaring passes you in the 
street. Everyone knows that the sound changes as it 
passes you. 
(A) Something similar happens with light waves as well as 
other electromagnetic radiation such as X­rays and 
microwaves. Things moving away from you get redder 
while things moving toward you get bluer. 
(B) It’s not that the siren changes its tune but it is because 
of something known as the Doppler Effect. This is 
where the sound waves coming from moving objects get 
squashed or stretched depending on whether something 
is moving toward or away from you.
(C) As a result, this effect is known as red or blue shift. 
You can’t normally notice this effect with light because 
the object has to be moving at huge speeds but you can 
with distant galaxies.
