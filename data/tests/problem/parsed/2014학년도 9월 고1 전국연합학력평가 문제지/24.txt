Little Angel's Stay and Play
Crayden Junior School invites babies and toddlers to 
“Little Angel’s Stay and Play” every Tuesday and 
Thursday morning from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.
Children from 0-4 years old are welcome as long as 
they are accompanied by an adult! It’s a chance to 
meet new friends and have fun for everyone!
There are lots of activities including music and 
movement, baby massage, and crafts to keep everyone 
happy and busy. We also have specially invited outside 
speakers who can pass on ideas and share experiences.
Admission is $6 per child, which includes snacks for 
adults and children. A discount is provided for three or 
more children together.
We are taking applications only on our homepage:
