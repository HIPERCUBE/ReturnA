The human voice can form incredibly different sounds, 
but each individual language contains only a subset of 
potential sound units, or phonemes. One phoneme that 
occurs in only about twenty percent of the world’s 
languages is the ejective consonant, such as [p] or [k]. 
Caleb Everett, an anthropologist, decided to map where 
this sound occurs. He took a sample of 567 languages 
spoken around the world and compared the locations and 
altitudes of those that either contained or ignored ejective 
consonants. Everett discovered that languages that included 
ejective consonants were generally spoken at a higher 
elevation than those that did not. He suggests that the 
sounds are more popular at high altitudes because lower 
air pressure may make it easier to produce the burst of 
air that is a key characteristic of ejective consonants.
