35. When the Muslims invaded southern Europe in the eighth 
century, they passed a law forbidding the sale of pork. This 
was done because the founder of the Muslim religion had 
declared pork to be unclean. ① This law, of course, didn’t 
change the Europeans’ love of pork, and there soon developed 
a black market for the meat. ② In secret transactions, usually 
conducted at night, farmers would sell to city dwellers pigs 
concealed in large bags. ③ Occasionally, a dishonest farmer 
would trick a buyer by selling a bag containing not a pig but 
a cat. ④ Pigs were traditionally associated with dirtiness 
because of their habit of rolling around in mud while cats 
were believed to be clean. ⑤ If something went wrong and 
the bag came open during the transaction, this literally “let 
the cat out of the bag” and this is why revealing a secret is 
said to be “letting the cat out of the bag.”
