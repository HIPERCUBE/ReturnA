31. Some study guides advocate filling out elaborate 
calendars so you will know what you are supposed to be 
doing during every minute, hour, and day throughout the 
entire semester. They would have you allocate the time 
periods to study each subject, to eat meals, to engage in 
athletic events, to socialize with friends, and so forth. I feel 
that this approach is a serious mistake. Not only will 
students be unwilling to follow such schedules, it is 
undesirable for humans to attempt such strict arrangements. 
Following such a schedule would lead you to feel that your 
whole life is predetermined and you would quickly become 
bored with your studies. As Frederick Nietzsche, the 
German philosopher, inquired, “Is not life a hundred times 
too short for us to bore ourselves?” Use calendars for their 
intended purpose to record significant dates. Write down the 
dates of important events, such as exams and deadlines for 
term papers, so you will know how much time you have to 
prepare for them. Don’t                                     . 
① violate social contracts 
② let calendars regulate your life
③ arrange your schedule to fit others’
④ make frequent changes in decision‒making
⑤ underestimate the value of time management
