Most people don’t assess their roles frequently enough and 
so stay in positions for years longer than they should, 
settling for suboptimal situations. There isn’t a magic 
number for the amount of time you should stay in one role 
before evaluating whether it’s right or not. But it makes 
sense to think about how often you do. Some people 
readjust their lives daily or weekly, constantly optimizing. 
Others wait years before noticing that they’ve ended up far 
from where they had hoped to be. The more frequently you 
assess your situation, looking for ways to fix problems, the 
more likely you are to find yourself in a position where 
things are going well.
