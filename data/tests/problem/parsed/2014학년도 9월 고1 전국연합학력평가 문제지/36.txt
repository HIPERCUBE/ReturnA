36. Feynman explains that light always takes the path of least 
time from point to point, and he uses the analogy of a 
lifeguard racing along a beach to save a drowning swimmer. 
The lifeguard could run straight to the water’s edge and then 
swim diagonally along the coast and out to sea, but this 
would result in a long time spent swimming, which is slower 
than running on the beach. ① Alternatively, he could run to 
the water’s edge at the point nearest to the swimmer, and 
dive in there. ② But this makes the total distance covered 
longer than it needs to be. ③ In order to save the drowning 
swimmer, the lifeguard needs to be mentally and physically 
prepared to cope with harsh sea conditions. ④ The optimum, 
if his aim is to reach the swimmer as quickly as possible, is 
somewhere in between these two extremes. ⑤ Light, too, 
takes such a path of least time from point to point, which is 
why it bends when passing between different materials. [3점]
