The initial stages of a relationship ― courtship, marriage, 
honeymoon ― are usually relatively conflict‒free. But then, 
while the couple is together, there is conflict. To many, 
conflict within a relationship means that the relationship 
itself is in trouble; perfect harmony ― the absence of 
conflict ― is considered the standard we should all strive for. 
As it turns out, conflict is not only unavoidable but actually 
crucial for the long‒term success of the relationship. Think 
of conflicts as a form of vaccine. When we immunize against 
a disease, we are in fact injecting a weakened strain of the 
disease into the body, which is then stimulated to develop 
the antibodies that enable it to deal with more major 
assaults later on. Likewise, minor conflicts help our 
relationship develop defense capabilities; they immunize the 
relationship and help partners deal with major gridlocks 
when they arise.
