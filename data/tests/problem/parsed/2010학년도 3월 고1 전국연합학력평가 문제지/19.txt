The mystery of a dog named Kent who didn’t respond to
any commands has been solved―① he only ‘speaks’ Polish!
The workers at an animal center were worried that Kent
was deaf, until they knew ② he had lived with a family from
Poland. So they learned some basic commands, like ‘sit’ and
‘come here’ in Polish and Kent responded straight away.
Four months later, ③ he now understands in English and
Polish, and is looking for a new home. One of the workers
at the animal center said ④ he was pleased to have found
out what was wrong. He also said anyone who wants to
adopt Kent doesn’t have to speak Polish, as ⑤ he now
understands enough English commands too.
