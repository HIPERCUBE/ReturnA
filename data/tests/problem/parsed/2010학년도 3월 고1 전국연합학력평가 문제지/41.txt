41. Many schools in the country have already closed their
doors because of the decreased number of students. School
buildings, once bloomed with children with passion for
learning, have stood lonely with no children to fill them.
Now they may not have to feel lonely. They are changing to
meet the needs of local people. They are now giving their
rooms to local people for cultural events such as concerts or
exhibitions. Those people who haven't had many cultural
experiences are now enjoying long-awaited cultural events.
Those closed schools may become lively again soon with
people visiting them, though they may not be children.
