Scientists in Canada did an interesting experiment with
jewelweeds, pretty flowers that grow in wet, shady spots.
They planted the flowers in pots with either siblings or
strangers. Sibling plants were grown from seeds that came
from the same mother plant. Stranger plants were grown
from seeds from different mother plants.
When jewelweeds were planted in pots with strangers,
the plants grew more leaves than when they were planted
alone. This response shows that plants are competing with
strangers for sunlight, because a plant with more leaves can
receive more light. Jewelweeds normally grow in the shade,
where sunlight is not enough, so they have to compete for
sunshine.
When jewelweeds were planted with siblings, they grew a
few more branches than when they were alone— but they
did not start growing lots of extra leaves. This behavior
shows the plants are more likely to share resources, rather
than compete.
The plants showed this response only when they shared
soil. When strangers were planted in different pots, they
did not grow more leaves. This difference shows that the
plants must use their roots to recognize sibling plants.
