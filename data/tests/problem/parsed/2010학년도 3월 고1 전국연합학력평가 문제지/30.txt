Can you remove the bottom coin in a stack without
touching the other coins in the stack and without having the
stack fall over? Build a stack of ten coins. Place another
coin ① beside the stack. Leave about an inch between this
coin and the stack. Flick the ② single coin hard with your
forefinger. Give it a really hard flick. The ③ top coin will
fly out from the stack. If all goes well, ④ the rest will stay
neatly in place. Why? Inertia keeps the stack of coins from
moving even when the bottom one is suddenly snapped
away. Because the stack was not moving at the beginning, it
tends to ⑤ stay that way. Scientists say, A body in one
position tends to remain in the same position.
