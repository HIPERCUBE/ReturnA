If we start a task asking “What can I gain from this?” it
will make a simple problem become out of focus and delay
its solution. Even a simple problem can become very
difficult to deal with if we let our personal desires influence
it. Therefore, we should try to have a heart that can see
things as they truly are. We need to see things as they are
even when doing so seems to put us in trouble. When we
start to see things with unselfish eyes, the problem may
clear up and a simple solution might even suddenly appear
to us.
