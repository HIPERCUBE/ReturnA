Contrary to popular belief, reading books in poor light does
not ruin your eyes. ①When you read by moonlight or under
the covers, you tend to squint to focus on letters. ②
Sometimes, this gives you a headache, makes you tired, or
causes pain in the muscles around your eyes and your vision
seems less clear. ③However, you won’t suffer any
long-term eye damage. ④ Direct lighting helps people stay
more focused while reading books. ⑤A good night’s rest
will help your tired eyes work properly again.
* squint: 눈을 가늘게 뜨고 보다
