18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
This is an act of giving. This is usually done for kind and
good-hearted purposes. For example, people do this for
those who are suffering from floods, earthquakes, or hunger.
This may take the form of giving money, services, food,
medical care, or new or used goods such as clothing and
toys. When people do this for others, they usually don’t
expect something in return. It is possible to do this in the
name of others to honor someone or something.
