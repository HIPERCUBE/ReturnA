34. Collecting can open new worlds for children. Collecting
stamps, for example, shows them cultures or historical
events of a country. Plant or animal specimens teach them
about the natural world. Collecting also gives children
opportunities to learn skills that can be used every day.
While playing with collections such as dolls, comic books,
stickers, and so on, children can organize their treasures by
size, shape, or color. This will teach them to see the world
from different points of view. Thinking about the
relationships among their pieces, they may realize things in
the world are connected with each other.
