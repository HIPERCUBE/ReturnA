I heard that you didn’t get the lead role in the play though
you had a great audition. But you should learn the role as if
you did have the lead. Even if you do not act in the show,
mastering such a difficult role will serve you well in the
future. I had a similar situation in school, though in a
different area: I wanted to be the editor of the school paper,
but the teacher in charge picked another student. I was
disappointed, but I kept writing and now I’m a columnist in
a newspaper. So never give up! You are great, and that’s all
that matters!
