39. We like to help our neighbors when they are in trouble.
But sometimes people get in each other’s way, and create
confusion by trying to give help and advice where they’re
not wanted. Actually there are often so many people telling
others what to do, so no one really knows how things
should be done. For example, if five different people show a
young child the proper way to tie a pair of shoes, it will not
be helpful. The child might get so confused by the five
different ways that he or she can’t do it in the end.

③ 아니 땐 굴뚝에 연기 나랴.
④ 돌다리도 두들겨 보고 건너라.
⑤ 사공이 많으면 배가 산으로 간다.
