28. What makes a good walk? Most of all, a good walk should
be . There should be rich colors
to delight our eyes and sweet sound to ring in our ears.
Spring flowers, summer trees, autumn leaves, and winter
snow are all nice surprises along the way. The singing of
birds, murmuring of a stream, whispering of the wind, and
happy talking of people are the symphonic sounds of a good
walk. You can look around or pick up flowers or sit for a
while in the course of a long walk. After this good
refreshing walk, you’ll feel alive and relaxed.
