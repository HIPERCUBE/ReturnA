This is an act of giving. This is usually done for kind and
good-hearted purposes. For example, people do this for
those who are suffering from floods, earthquakes, or hunger.
This may take the form of giving money, services, food,
medical care, or new or used goods such as clothing and
toys. When people do this for others, they usually don’t
expect something in return. It is possible to do this in the
name of others to honor someone or something.

The mystery of a dog named Kent who didn’t respond to
any commands has been solved―① he only ‘speaks’ Polish!
The workers at an animal center were worried that Kent
was deaf, until they knew ② he had lived with a family from
Poland. So they learned some basic commands, like ‘sit’ and
‘come here’ in Polish and Kent responded straight away.
Four months later, ③ he now understands in English and
Polish, and is looking for a new home. One of the workers
at the animal center said ④ he was pleased to have found
out what was wrong. He also said anyone who wants to
adopt Kent doesn’t have to speak Polish, as ⑤ he now
understands enough English commands too.

I heard that you didn’t get the lead role in the play though
you had a great audition. But you should learn the role as if
you did have the lead. Even if you do not act in the show,
mastering such a difficult role will serve you well in the
future. I had a similar situation in school, though in a
different area: I wanted to be the editor of the school paper,
but the teacher in charge picked another student. I was
disappointed, but I kept writing and now I’m a columnist in
a newspaper. So never give up! You are great, and that’s all
that matters!

Contrary to popular belief, reading books in poor light does
not ruin your eyes. ①When you read by moonlight or under
the covers, you tend to squint to focus on letters. ②
Sometimes, this gives you a headache, makes you tired, or
causes pain in the muscles around your eyes and your vision
seems less clear. ③However, you won’t suffer any
long-term eye damage. ④ Direct lighting helps people stay
more focused while reading books. ⑤A good night’s rest
will help your tired eyes work properly again.

24. A recent study shows that kids who watch a lot of TV
are more likely to be than those who do not.
Can you guess why? It’s because of commercials on TV!
The junk food is often advertised in commercials by their
favorite cartoon characters. It is so appealing that kids just
want to go out and get it right away! Kids who watch a lot
of TV and those attractive commercials are also likely to
stay only at home and be getting less exercise.

25. Deciding whether your child is bright, and how and when
to give them right kind of attention, requires careful
observation. For this, it can be very helpful to
, though it may sound like a bit of hard
work. It helps you to take a step outside the routine of
everyday living, so that you can get a clearer, more
objective view of what is happening in your family. Then,
looking back, you may be able to see how situations have
developed, and how they can be changed. A daily record
book will help you not only to judge whether you have a
bright child but also to watch his or her emotional
development.

26. Now, more than ever, good job opportunities are opening
up for the person who speaks well before a group. Even
though you do not intend to become a lawyer, a radio or
television announcer, or a professor, you have good reason
to learn how to speak effectively. For example, you take
part in various group activities every day. If you want to
stand out from the group, you have to make your ideas and
feelings known to others. You won’t be noticed if you shyly
whisper at the corner, “Me, too.” There comes a time when
you must .

27. I believe that a person can find truth in life by
. For example, I know a
carpenter who has devoted himself to his work for years.
He has got great skills and can also tell much about life.
Unfortunately, young people graduating from school quickly
grow impatient with their unattractive, basic-level jobs.
They wonder if their work will lead to anything meaningful,
and they ask for different responsibilities― but they may
never be satisfied. If our knowledge is broad but shallow,
we really know nothing. Yet developing one skill in great
depth can show truth in life. [3점]

28. What makes a good walk? Most of all, a good walk should
be . There should be rich colors
to delight our eyes and sweet sound to ring in our ears.
Spring flowers, summer trees, autumn leaves, and winter
snow are all nice surprises along the way. The singing of
birds, murmuring of a stream, whispering of the wind, and
happy talking of people are the symphonic sounds of a good
walk. You can look around or pick up flowers or sit for a
while in the course of a long walk. After this good
refreshing walk, you’ll feel alive and relaxed.

They searched every room and surrounded Mark’s mother.
She stood there bravely. “A slave? We have no slaves on
our farm,” she was saying. “We’re looking for a slave named
Jim who ran away,” said a bearded man. “If you’re hiding my
slave...” Mark didn’t wait to hear more. His mother had
helped many slaves on their way to freedom. She was good
at handling men like these. Mark came out of the house
secretly. In the distance, the river roared in the night. A
weak light was seen on its bank. Mark ran toward it and
said, “Jim, they’re searching for you!”

Can you remove the bottom coin in a stack without
touching the other coins in the stack and without having the
stack fall over? Build a stack of ten coins. Place another
coin ① beside the stack. Leave about an inch between this
coin and the stack. Flick the ② single coin hard with your
forefinger. Give it a really hard flick. The ③ top coin will
fly out from the stack. If all goes well, ④ the rest will stay
neatly in place. Why? Inertia keeps the stack of coins from
moving even when the bottom one is suddenly snapped
away. Because the stack was not moving at the beginning, it

People are often under stress. Some are taking exams,
some are considering moving to another job, and others are
worried about deadlines. They believe these stressful
situations give them gray hair. (A) , so far no
scientific evidence proves a bad day turns your hair silver.
According to medical doctors, your hair turning gray runs in
your family. (B) , if your father’s hair becomes gray
when he is quite young, you are highly likely to be in the
same situation. Thus, when you get gray hair, it might be
wise to dye your hair rather than to blame those stressful
situations.

33. Before picking out a souvenir to take home, consider how
it was made and where it came from. If animal products
such as animal bone or skin were used to make it, just
leave it on the shelf. Picking your souvenirs directly from
nature is another bad idea. That is because sea shells are
more beautiful on the beach than on your desk. Instead,
choose something which does not have negative effects on
the place you visit, such as paintings or crafts produced by

34. Collecting can open new worlds for children. Collecting
stamps, for example, shows them cultures or historical
events of a country. Plant or animal specimens teach them
about the natural world. Collecting also gives children
opportunities to learn skills that can be used every day.
While playing with collections such as dolls, comic books,
stickers, and so on, children can organize their treasures by
size, shape, or color. This will teach them to see the world
from different points of view. Thinking about the
relationships among their pieces, they may realize things in
the world are connected with each other.
* specimen: 표본
① how to start collecting

Susan B. Anthony, a famous American women’s rights
movement leader, was born in New York in 1820. Susan’s
father sent Susan to a school for girls, but she had to
return when her father’s business failed. She started
teaching the children in her hometown. But soon she stopped
teaching and began to work for women’s equal rights.
Though many people hated her message, Susan organized
groups to get women the right to vote. In 1872, she was
arrested for voting in a national election, which was against
the law. However, she kept fighting for her belief until she
died in 1906. In 1920, the law finally gave women the right
to vote.

Kurinji is a bright purple-blue, bell-shaped flower, which
grows mainly in Kodaikanal, South India. People, including
scientists, take special interest in it because it blossoms
only once in twelve years. In Kodaikanal, there is a famous
temple, Kurinji Andavar Temple, named after the kurinji
flower that surrounds it every twelve years. After the 2006
flowering, the next great flowering is expected in 2018.
Kurinji recognizes the difference in day length. By sensing
regular changes in day length, kurinji counts the number of
years to wait before they flower.

38. We have an idea of how things should be done and what
is possible and impossible. These ideas make up the box we
live in, and this box limits our possibilities. We generally
don’t go outside the box which society creates for us.
Instead, we follow the patterns we’ve learned from our
friends, family, and culture. Often these patterns aren’t as
satisfying as living outside the box might be, but sometimes
trying a new pattern might open up a new possibility for
you. For example, the next time when it rains, go for a
walk without an umbrella. Even this small adventure can
help you break out of your box.

39. We like to help our neighbors when they are in trouble.
But sometimes people get in each other’s way, and create
confusion by trying to give help and advice where they’re
not wanted. Actually there are often so many people telling
others what to do, so no one really knows how things
should be done. For example, if five different people show a
young child the proper way to tie a pair of shoes, it will not
be helpful. The child might get so confused by the five
different ways that he or she can’t do it in the end.

To find the answer to this question, they can build a
simple experiment.
You don’t always need to plan everything for your
students to have them do science. ( ① ) Sometimes all you
need to do is suggest interesting ideas. ( ② ) The students
will carry them out if they find the ideas interesting enough.
( ③ ) For example, you can ask your students, Is yawning
contagious with dogs? ( ④ ) First, they watch a dog
closely for 15 minutes and count the number of yawns. ( ⑤ )
Then they yawn repeatedly in front of the dog for another
15 minutes and count the yawns of the dog again.

41. Many schools in the country have already closed their
doors because of the decreased number of students. School
buildings, once bloomed with children with passion for
learning, have stood lonely with no children to fill them.
Now they may not have to feel lonely. They are changing to
meet the needs of local people. They are now giving their
rooms to local people for cultural events such as concerts or
exhibitions. Those people who haven't had many cultural
experiences are now enjoying long-awaited cultural events.
Those closed schools may become lively again soon with
people visiting them, though they may not be children.

42. Do you know what contribution Korea has made to
Christmas Day? According to Korea’s National Institute of
Biological Resources(NIBR), one of the most popular trees
used as a Christmas tree is a Korean fir. According to the
institute, the Korean fir tree is a native evergreen, which
grows in Mt. Halla and Mt. Jiri in Korea. However, not many
know that the tree used to be found only in Korea. In 1904
a European scientist took out of Korea a sample of the
Korean fir. People soon saw that the clear, triangle shape
and its green color were just right for the Christmas
atmosphere and began to use it as a Christmas tree.

Newborn babies cry rather less than older babies. But
even a small amount of crying can be quite worrying
particularly to new parents.
(A) For them, it may be helpful to know that crying makes
the baby’s lungs stronger, or sends oxygen to his blood.
(B) More importantly, crying is your baby’s main form of
communication. When he cries, you need to respond
quickly and find out what is wrong.
(C) However, this does not mean that it is good to leave a
baby to ‘cry it out.’ Crying is hard on a baby, and it
uses up his limited energy.

If we start a task asking “What can I gain from this?” it
will make a simple problem become out of focus and delay
its solution. Even a simple problem can become very
difficult to deal with if we let our personal desires influence
it. Therefore, we should try to have a heart that can see
things as they truly are. We need to see things as they are
even when doing so seems to put us in trouble. When we
start to see things with unselfish eyes, the problem may
clear up and a simple solution might even suddenly appear
to us.
