42. Do you know what contribution Korea has made to
Christmas Day? According to Korea’s National Institute of
Biological Resources(NIBR), one of the most popular trees
used as a Christmas tree is a Korean fir. According to the
institute, the Korean fir tree is a native evergreen, which
grows in Mt. Halla and Mt. Jiri in Korea. However, not many
know that the tree used to be found only in Korea. In 1904
a European scientist took out of Korea a sample of the
Korean fir. People soon saw that the clear, triangle shape
and its green color were just right for the Christmas
atmosphere and began to use it as a Christmas tree.
