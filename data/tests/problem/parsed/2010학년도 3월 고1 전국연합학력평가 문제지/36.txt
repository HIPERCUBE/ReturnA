Susan B. Anthony, a famous American women’s rights
movement leader, was born in New York in 1820. Susan’s
father sent Susan to a school for girls, but she had to
return when her father’s business failed. She started
teaching the children in her hometown. But soon she stopped
teaching and began to work for women’s equal rights.
Though many people hated her message, Susan organized
groups to get women the right to vote. In 1872, she was
arrested for voting in a national election, which was against
the law. However, she kept fighting for her belief until she
died in 1906. In 1920, the law finally gave women the right
to vote.
