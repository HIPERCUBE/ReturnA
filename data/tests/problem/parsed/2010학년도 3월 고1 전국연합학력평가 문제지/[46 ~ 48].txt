(A) “How come Grandma’s last name is not on Dad’s
papers?” I asked my mom one day when I was 8 or 9
years old. Her last name never showed up anywhere in my
family record. “All I see is Brown, but her name is Smith!”
My mom answered, “Well, it is because she isn’t his birth
mother.”
(B) She gave attention to the other kids she cared for and
treated them no differently from her own children. My
grandmother’s completely changed my dad’s
life. Without her, he might have dropped out of school and
surely would have had a terrible life.
(C) After learning all this, my grandmother invited my
dad to live with her family. My father refused at first, but
eventually she persuaded him to live with her family for
several years. He was not the only kid she was taking care
of. She had four of her own kids and other foster kids.
(D) I was very shocked by Mom’s reply. I had known my
grandmother since birth. In fact, whenever I saw her I
thought my dad looked like her. The woman I’d known as
Grandma was actually my father’s high school teacher. She
noticed that he was an intelligent student but received low
grades, so she tried to find out why he was not doing well.
She found out that my father’s parents died when he was
15.
