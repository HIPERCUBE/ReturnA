In a study, 158 moviegoers in Philadelphia were given
a medium or a large container of free popcorn that was
either fresh or not. After the movie, how much popcorn
had been eaten was checked. The moviegoers were also
asked if the popcorn had been tasty or not. The results
showed that moviegoers who were given fresh popcorn
ate 45.3% more popcorn when it was given to them in
