In a study, 158 moviegoers in Philadelphia were given
a medium or a large container of free popcorn that was
either fresh or not. After the movie, how much popcorn
had been eaten was checked. The moviegoers were also
asked if the popcorn had been tasty or not. The results
showed that moviegoers who were given fresh popcorn
ate 45.3% more popcorn when it was given to them in
large containers. Even when the popcorn didn’t taste
good, people still ate 33.6% more popcorn when eating
from a large container than from a medium-size
container.

food people eat.
(A) (B)

(A) “How come Grandma’s last name is not on Dad’s
papers?” I asked my mom one day when I was 8 or 9
years old. Her last name never showed up anywhere in my
family record. “All I see is Brown, but her name is Smith!”
My mom answered, “Well, it is because she isn’t his birth
mother.”
(B) She gave attention to the other kids she cared for and
treated them no differently from her own children. My
grandmother’s completely changed my dad’s
life. Without her, he might have dropped out of school and
surely would have had a terrible life.
(C) After learning all this, my grandmother invited my
dad to live with her family. My father refused at first, but
eventually she persuaded him to live with her family for
several years. He was not the only kid she was taking care
of. She had four of her own kids and other foster kids.
(D) I was very shocked by Mom’s reply. I had known my
grandmother since birth. In fact, whenever I saw her I
thought my dad looked like her. The woman I’d known as
Grandma was actually my father’s high school teacher. She
noticed that he was an intelligent student but received low
grades, so she tried to find out why he was not doing well.
She found out that my father’s parents died when he was
15.

Scientists in Canada did an interesting experiment with
jewelweeds, pretty flowers that grow in wet, shady spots.
They planted the flowers in pots with either siblings or
strangers. Sibling plants were grown from seeds that came
from the same mother plant. Stranger plants were grown
from seeds from different mother plants.
When jewelweeds were planted in pots with strangers,
the plants grew more leaves than when they were planted
alone. This response shows that plants are competing with
strangers for sunlight, because a plant with more leaves can
receive more light. Jewelweeds normally grow in the shade,
where sunlight is not enough, so they have to compete for
sunshine.
When jewelweeds were planted with siblings, they grew a
few more branches than when they were alone— but they
did not start growing lots of extra leaves. This behavior
shows the plants are more likely to share resources, rather
than compete.
The plants showed this response only when they shared
soil. When strangers were planted in different pots, they
did not grow more leaves. This difference shows that the
plants must use their roots to recognize sibling plants.
