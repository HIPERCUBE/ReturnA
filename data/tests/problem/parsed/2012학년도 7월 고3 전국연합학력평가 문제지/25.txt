25. Why did the same themes and motifs appear through the
myths and folktales of the entire world? One response of many
late-nineteenth century writers was to suggest that somehow
all the stories, myths and legends were simply attempts to
explain and to dramatize , familiar to all
mankind. One popular theory was that stories of the god who
dies and is reborn were “solar myths”, describing the setting
and rising of the sun. It was suggested that the widespread
folktales in which a heroine is eaten by a monster must have
had something to do with the sun being “eaten” by the moon
in the course of an eclipse. A more sophisticated version of
these arguments has been advanced in more recent times by
writers who attempted to relate the underlying forms of
tragedy and comedy to the theme of “death and resurrection”
in the cycle of the year, for example, winter giving way to
spring, and so forth.
