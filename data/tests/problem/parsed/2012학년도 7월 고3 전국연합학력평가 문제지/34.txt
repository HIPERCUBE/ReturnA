34. In order to efficiently use and measure time, everyone in
the world would like to fix noon as the time at which the
sun is at its highest point in the sky. However, this seems to
be impossible without the use of time zones. Since the Earth
rotates at the rate of 15 degrees every hour, the sun is at its
highest point in the sky at different times in the day for
different countries around the globe. The idea behind time
zones is that we can divide the world into 24 equal slices or
zones, 15 degrees each, and adjust the clocks accordingly for
each zone. We can thus preserve the need to fix noon as the
time when the sun is highest in the sky for each country,
and also make it easy to understand times between different
zones.
① the reason why we have time zones
② the origin of dividing a day into 24 hours
③ international policies for daylight saving time
④ the advantage of using the clockwise direction
⑤ the inconvenience of traveling through different time zones
