Much of socialization takes place during human interaction,
without the deliberate intent to impart knowledge or values.
(A) It is very likely that the message Sally received from the
morning’s interactions was that it is not OK for children
to interrupt adults, but it is OK for adults to interrupt
children. The example shows that unintentional socialization
may be the product of involvement in human interaction or
observation of interaction.
(B) Later that morning Sally and her friend Tanya are busily
playing with Legos. Sally is explaining and demonstrating
to Tanya how to fit the pieces together. Miss Jones
comes over to the block corner and interrupts with,
“Girls, please stop what you’re doing and come and see
what Rene has brought to school.”
(C) For example, a four-year-old approaches two teachers
conversing and excitedly says, “Miss Jones, Miss Jones,
look!” One teacher says, “Sally, don’t interrupt; we’re
talking.”
