heard the same cry ring through the still evening air, “Rip Van
Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!”―at the same time his dog bristled
up his back, and giving a low growl, skulked to his master’s
side, looking fearfully down into the glen. Rip now felt a vague
apprehension stealing over him: he looked anxiously in the
same direction, and perceived a strange figure slowly toiling up
the rocks, and bending under the weight of something he
carried on his back.
