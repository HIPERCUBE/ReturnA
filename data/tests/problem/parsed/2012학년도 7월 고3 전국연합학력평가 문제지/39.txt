39. How many times do you finish something even though you
wish you’d never started it? We clean our plates even if the
carrots are overcooked because they are there and we’ve
already started eating. We do this even though we would
never seek overcooked carrots and wouldn’t want them if
anyone offered them to us. We sit in the movie theater and
keep watching the movie when we think it’s terrible, even
though under no circumstances would we say yes if someone
asked, “Would you like to watch forty-five minutes of an
awful movie?” We do the same thing when we continue a
project that is off target. We keep going because we’ve
already started, not because it makes any sense to continue
what we’re doing. Don’t run in the wrong direction just
because you’re near the finish line. What is important is not
what you’ve already invested but what you stand to gain by
continuing.
