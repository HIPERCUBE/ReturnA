27. Using a cast after injuring an arm may cause your brain to
　　　　　　　 , according to a new study. For the
study, researchers examined 10 right-handed people with an injury
of the upper right arm that required a cast for at least 14 days.
The entire right arm and hand were restricted to little or no
movement during the study period. As a result, participants used
their non-dominant left hand for daily activities such as washing,
using a toothbrush, eating or writing. The group underwent two
MRI brain scans, the first within two days of the injury and the
second within 16 days of wearing the cast. The scans measured
the amount of gray and white matter in the brain. The study
found that the amount of gray and white matter in the left side of
the brain decreased up to ten percent, while the amount of gray
and white matter in the right side of the brain increased in size.
“These swift structural changes in the brain are associated with
skill transfer from the right hand to the left hand,” said the head
researcher.
