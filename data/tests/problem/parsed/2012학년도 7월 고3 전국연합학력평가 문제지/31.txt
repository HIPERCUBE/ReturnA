When you learn a new skill, at first you need to concentrate
in order to make your fingers, hands, and arms move in just
the right way, based on what you see. What you’re learning
is precision. After a while, (A) , the
“seeing-thinking-doing” gradually becomes “seeing-doing”
because your muscles seem to “know” and “remember” just what
to do. What you are learning now is speed. That’s “muscle
memory”. Of course, during the “drill-and-practice”, your muscles
are not really memorizing anything. (B) , what you
see with your eyes is interpreted by your brain in the form of
nerve signals to your muscles to make your body move. Now
by making the same movements in response to the same visual
cues over and over again, the associated nerve-muscle
connections gradually become more effective, and this is how
the “thinking” in the “seeing-thinking-doing” is gradually
replaced by “seeing-doing”.
(A) (B)
① for example …… Thus
② for example …… Furthermore
③ however …… Instead
④ however …… Similarly
⑤ therefore …… In contrast
