Empathy is made possible by a special group of nerve cells
called mirror neurons. These special cells enable us to “mirror”
emotions. Mirror neurons were first discovered by Italian
scientists who, while looking at the activity of individual nerve
cells inside the brains of monkeys, (A) noticed / noticing that
neurons in the same area of the brain were activated whether
the animals were performing a particular movement or simply
observing another monkey perform the same action. It appeared
as though the cells in the observer’s brain “mirrored” the
activity in the performer’s brain. A similar phenomenon takes
place when we watch someone (B) experiencing / experienced an
emotion and feel the same emotion in response. The same neural
systems get activated in a part of the insula, (C) it / which is part
of the mirror neuron system, and in the emotional brain areas
associated with the observed emotion.
