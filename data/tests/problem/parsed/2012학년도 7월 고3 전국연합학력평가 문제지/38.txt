38. Mary Jane Grant에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Mary Jane Grant was born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1805. Her
father was a Scottish soldier, and her mother a Jamaican. Mary
learned her nursing skills from her mother, who kept a boarding
house for invalid soldiers. Being of mixed race, Mary and her
family had few civil rights―they could not vote, hold public
office or enter the professions. In 1836, Mary married Edwin
Seacole but the marriage was short-lived as he died in 1844. In
1854, Mary travelled to England, and approached the War Office,
asking to be sent as an army nurse to the Crimea, but she was
refused. Undaunted, Mary funded her own trip to the Crimea
where she established the British Hotel near Balaclava to
provide comfortable quarters for sick and injured soldiers.
