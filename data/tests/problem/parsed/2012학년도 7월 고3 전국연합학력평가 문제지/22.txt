We have been talking of social science as if it were a single
entity. That is hardly the case. Which, in fact, are the social
sciences? ①One way to answer the question is to see what
departments and disciplines universities group under this name.
②Social science divisions usually include departments of
anthropology, economics, politics, and sociology. ③Why do
they not ordinarily include schools of law, education, business,
social service, and public administration as well, all of which
draw on the concepts and methods of the social sciences for
their development? ④ It explains why a social science major
provides excellent preparation for law school. ⑤The reason is
that the main purpose of such schools is to train for
professional work outside of the university, while the previously
mentioned departments are more exclusively dedicated to the
pursuit of systematic knowledge of human society, an activity
that usually goes on within the university.
