Kalu, an elephant in the Central Park Zoo, trusted only one
handler, a man named Albert Brockell. When Albert became
sick with leukemia, Kalu refused to go inside to his quarters
because ①his “main man” had not spoken the command. As
winter approached, this became a serious concern. No one else
could persuade ② him. He responded to an attempt at forcing
him inside with anger, injuring the new would-be handler.
Desperate zoo officials finally made a recording of Albert at the
hospital, so Kalu could hear his voice ordering ③him to go
inside. But Kalu refused to obey a mere recording. Finally
Albert volunteered to be taken to the zoo in an ambulance.
④He was delivered to the elephant’s side on a gurney. “Go
inside, Kalu,” he said. Finally ⑤he obeyed.
