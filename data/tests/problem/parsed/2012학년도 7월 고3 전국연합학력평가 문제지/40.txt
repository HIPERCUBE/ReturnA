40. Sometimes we need an adversary to defeat in order to turn
our “I” and “me” into “we” and “us”. We may think of
ourselves as independent individualists, yet we can be
transformed into enthusiastic citizens, fans, members, or
followers by a team championship or victory. Researchers call
it Basking in Reflected Glory. After a team victory, far more
students show up to classes wearing clothes with their
university’s name and symbols plastered on them. When they
talk about the team’s win, they are more likely to use the
pronouns “we” and “us” instead of “they” and “them”. They
stress their connection to the winners. The social
psychological perspective on community and fan loyalty
stresses the positive impact of this shared identity―as a
supporter and fan of the team―on relationships and overall
well-being. It helps people escape the feeling of isolation and
individuality that sometimes plagues them.
