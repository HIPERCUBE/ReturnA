In a series of studies, researchers had participants fill in a
questionnaire on their preferences among candy bar brands.
Some participants answered an “intention question” (How likely
are you to purchase a candy bar in the near future?), while
others answered an “attitude question” (How positive or
negative are you about the candy bars available to you?). After
they answered the questions, they were asked to make an
actual brand choice decision in a store. “Those who responded
to an intention question were more likely to choose the brand
they previously indicated they preferred the most than those
who responded to an attitude question,” the researchers say.
Consumers are motivated to fulfill their intentions, and this
motivation narrows their focus. “The intention puts the
intention-related brand to the front of consumers’ minds and
pushes other well-liked brands to the back until the consumer
has accomplished the intention,” the head researcher says.
People who state a(n) (A) of purchasing a certain
brand are more likely to buy it than those who express
their attitude toward the brand because they are motivated
to (B) what they intend.
(A) (B)
① intention …… complete
② habit …… attain
③ intention …… hide
④ decision …… revise
⑤ habit …… conceal

(A)
In high school, sports were Kazazic’s passion. She planned
to become a professional athlete. Then in 1993, during the
Bosnian civil war, a bomb by Croat separatists exploded in the
courtyard of her building. The six friends she’d been chatting
with were killed; 16-year-old Kazazic was badly injured. The
bomb riddled (a) her left arm and both of her legs.
(B)
Her parents finally joined her in Maryland, but Kazazic was
already fiercely independent. After studying psychology at a
university, (b) she got a job at an insurance firm and
eventually founded her own website development company.
After dozens of surgeries, she was able to play the occasional
round of golf. But she still hobbled on an imperfect leg, and
each activity left her in agony for days. To unwind, (c) she
would watch dolphins play at Clearwater Marine Aquarium,
near her home.
(C)
A young dolphin, Winter, who had lost her tail in a crab
trap, caught Kazazic’s eye: “She swam more like a shrimp
than a dolphin. I identified with her.” Trainers were fitting
Winter with a high-tech tail―a flexible steel joint covered in
silicone plastic. When they were done, Winter streaked off
through the water. Kazazic was fascinated. ‘If (d) she can do
this, there’s no way I can’t,’ she thought. Within ten days, she
had a new leg with its soft liner and built-in microprocessor
that adjusts the fit for different activities. It was the disabled
dolphin that gave inspiration and helped her to feel pain-free
for the first time in almost 16 years.
(D)
At a makeshift hospital, her left leg was considered beyond
repair and amputated just below the knee. British activist
Sally Becker, who evacuated many children during the war,
arranged to bring (e) her to the United States for treatment.
Kazazic spent nearly two years in a hospital in Maryland. A
few months in, Kazazic received her first artificial leg, but
walking was intensely painful. Nonetheless, she managed to
graduate from a high school in Maryland. At 18, she left the
hospital and moved into an apartment with a fellow refugee.

If you’ve ever had would-be buyers looking around a
house, you’ll have noticed their observations about each room
are usually limited to: “Hmm, it’s a good size.” or “Hmm, it’s
rather small.” Little wonder then that home-improvers are so
often fixated on making their rooms appear as spacious as
possible. Home design practice will tell them to paint their
ceilings as as possible, and in particular make the
ceiling distinct from the walls. This contrast between ceilings
and walls, so the advice goes, will increase the perceived
room height. Does it really? A recent study shows a
different view for this tradition. Researchers had 32
participants wear 3-D glasses and use a sliding scale to
judge the ceiling height of many virtual rooms. The rooms
were empty and the colors were in shades of grey so that
only lightness was varied. In particular, the ceiling, walls and
floor were varied in lightness. Increasing the lightness of the
ceiling did increase its perceived height. However, contrary
to the traditional advice, the rooms also appeared higher
when the walls were lighter. Moreover, the effect of ceiling
lightness and wall lightness was additive. So the contrast
effect informed by traditional design practice was not
complete. Floor lightness made no difference to estimates of
ceiling height, so it can’t be overall room lightness that’s
crucial, but only the combination of wall and ceiling
lightness. “If you intend to make the room appear higher,
paint both the ceiling and the walls in a color.”
