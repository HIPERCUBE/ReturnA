Last week, your company came out to paint the stripes on
our new parking lot. I was on vacation at the time but when I
returned, I was appalled at the poor workmanship that was
done. Some of the lines are shorter than others and most are
uneven. Our patrons are not even sure how to park. We’ve
finally had another company lined up to redo the work next
week. The work your company did should be somehow
removed. Please be advised you have until Friday of this week
to be finished. I expect to see a clean blacktop surface ready
for the new crew to begin work on. I myself will be overseeing
this and expect to have the utmost cooperation.
