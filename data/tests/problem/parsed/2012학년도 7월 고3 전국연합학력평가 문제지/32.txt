Most visitors to zoos are convinced that the inmates live in
①comfort, but this view is far from the truth in many cases.
Many caged animals are in fact facing a survival problem as
severe as that of their cousins in the ②wild. Well fed, well
housed, well cared for, and protected from its natural enemies, the
zoo animal in its super-Welfare State existence is bored, sometimes
literally to death. According to some zoologists, the animal species
which seem to react most strongly to this ③monotony are the
ones that do not rely on one or two highly developed adaptations
or “tricks” to survive in the wild. Normally seizing every
opportunity to exploit the chances and variety of their
surroundings, they are constantly ④exploring. It is not surprising
that when such species are placed in the highly ⑤variable
environment of a zoo cage, where there are few novel stimuli, they
cannot accept any kind of enforced inactivity.
