30. Several species of oceanic bacteria consume methane gas that
naturally seeps from the ocean floor. So after the BP blowout
in spring and summer of 2010, when 172 million gallons of
methane-rich oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, scientists
wondered how much of the dissolved gas might be consumed
by native microbes. To find out, oceanographers collected more
than 700 water samples around the spill. They found bacteria
had eliminated more than 120,000 tons of methane, essentially
returning the concentrations in the area to normal. But there is
still work to be done. The bacterial cleanup probably did not
eliminate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, known as one of the
most toxic and potentially dangerous ingredients in oil. “The
bacteria did a nice job taking care of some of the major oil
components,” the researcher says, “but that doesn’t mean we
can .” [3점]
① eliminate all bacteria from the ocean
② use technology to dissolve toxic chemicals
③ prevent bacteria from contaminating the ocean
④ restore the natural habitat of endangered species
⑤ count on nature to handle all man-made disasters
