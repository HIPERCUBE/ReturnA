42. Usually, an article for publication in a scholarly journal is
produced for a specific audience. It will have to be carefully and
accurately written because the editors of the publication and its
readers will not accept poorly researched writing. When an author
finishes writing an article, he or she submits it to the editors of
the publication. It is then usually sent to many professional
readers who will comment on how the information was gathered
and decide whether the article is worthy of publication. Feedback
from them often results in significant revisions or changes to the
document. The author might even decide not to proceed with
further writing if, for example, the document has major flaws or if
the research on which it is based is found to be incomplete or
faulty. This step is rigorous and it usually ensures that only
high-quality articles are published.
