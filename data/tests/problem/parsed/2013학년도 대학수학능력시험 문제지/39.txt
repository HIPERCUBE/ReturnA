39. I once heard a woman say, “Of course, he’s successful. 
It’s in his genes.” I knew she wasn’t talking about me, 
because I was wearing shorts. I also knew she was wrong. 
Success is not in our genes. Not all children of successful 
people become successful themselves. Many kids have 
everything going for them and end up total disasters. They 
do none of the things that helped their parents succeed. 
The number of unsuccessful people who come from 
successful parents is proof that genes have nothing to do 
with success. You can’t change your genes, but you can 
change the people you imitate. The choice is up to you, 
so why not imitate the best? There are hundreds of great 
people to imitate and copy. They have terrific advice about 
what helped them succeed. Jot down notes and carry 
them around in your pants pocket. Then success will be 
in your jeans, even if it’s not in your genes.
