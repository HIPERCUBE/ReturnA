(A)
On May 29th there was a heavy rain but the sun came 
out the next day. Driving back from the village, I stopped 
the car because a small woodchuck was traveling 
along the road, its belly almost flat to the gravel. I got 
out, took off my sweater, threw it over the woodchuck and 
wrapped him in it, then put him on the floor of the car 
while I drove home. I guessed the rain had washed out his 
burrow. If I hadn’t come along (a) he would have eventually 
died of starvation. Rescuing him, I felt as large as Fate.

(B)
Very shortly the carton seemed too small. I offered 
him a nest made of a covered box, bedded with straw 
and with a round doorway cut in the front. He knew 
instantly that a hole spells home, and (b) he  dashed 
inside. Every time I came to feed him, he jumped into 
my lap as eagerly as ever. As the months passed, the 
chuck grew bigger and bigger. My husband remarked  
that if I didn’t do something soon, I would be chased 
around for the rest of my days by a 15-pound 
woodchuck begging for milk.
(C)
At home I put him in the bathtub and my husband 
found a large carton. (c) He put cat litter in the bottom 
and straw on top of that. When I put the chuck in, he 
gratefully burrowed into the straw. I made a mixture of 
milk and baby cereal for him. When I gave it to the 
chuck, he ate it greedily. (d) He accepted me quickly. If 
I put my hand in the carton, he nibbled my fingers. It 
became clear that I was imprinting the woodchuck and 
vice versa.
