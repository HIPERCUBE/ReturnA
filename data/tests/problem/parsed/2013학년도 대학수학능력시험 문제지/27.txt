27. Recent evidence suggests that the common ancestor of 
Neanderthals and modern people, living about 400,000 
years ago, may have already been using pretty sophisticated 
language. If language is based on genes and is the key to 
cultural evolution, and Neanderthals had language, then 
why did the Neanderthal toolkit show so little cultural 
change? Moreover, genes would undoubtedly have changed 
during the human revolution after 200,000 years ago, but 
more in response to new habits than as causes of them. At 
an earlier date, cooking selected mutations for smaller guts 
and mouths, rather than vice versa. At a later date,  milk 
drinking selected for mutations for retaining lactose digestion 
into adulthood in people of western European and East 
African descent.                                                . 
The appeal to a genetic change driving evolution gets 
gene-culture co-evolution backwards: it is a top-down 
ex planation for a bottom-up process. [3Ï†ê]
