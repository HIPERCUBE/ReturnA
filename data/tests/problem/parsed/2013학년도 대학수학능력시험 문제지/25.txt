25. In Belding’s ground squirrels, males leave home and 
females mature in their natal area. This male-biased dispersal 
creates an imbalance in the way males and females are 
related to those individuals around them ― females find  
themselves surrounded by relatives, while males are generally 
in areas with complete  strangers. This asymmetry translates 
into females who warn close kin by emitting alarm calls, 
while males generally do not emit calls since their dispersal 
from their natal areas means their blood kin typically do 
not benefit from such a warning. Further support for the 
kinship-based alarm-calling hypothesis includes Sherman’s 
finding that in the rare instances when females do move 
away from their natal groups and into groups with far fewer 
relatives, they                                       .
① end up acquiring the alarm calls of the new group
② make constant attempts to bring their blood kin along
③ display a tendency to become more active and cooperative
④ emit alarm calls less frequently than do native females
⑤ adopt a more elaborate defense mechanism than alarm 
calls
