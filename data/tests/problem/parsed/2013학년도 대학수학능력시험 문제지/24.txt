24. Have you ever heard anyone say of a dog, “Well, he’s 
very successful and lives in a beautiful house, but he’s 
not very happy”? One reason most dogs are much happier 
than most people is that dogs aren’t affected by external 
circumstances the way we are. I notice that even when it’s 
pouring rain outside, my dogs, Blue and Celeste , are still 
excited to go for a walk. As soon as I open the front door 
to look outside, they’re beside me in a flash, standing 
expectantly, ready for an adventure. I usually wait for a   
break in the downpour, and then we all dash out together. 
The fact that the ground is wet and there are mud 
puddles dotting the landscape                          . 
While I’m carefully picking my way around the wet 
spots, the dogs are joyfully splashing right through them. 
They aren’t afraid to get their paws dirty.
