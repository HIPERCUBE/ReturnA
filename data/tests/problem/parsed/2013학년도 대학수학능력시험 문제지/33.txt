33. Gregorio Dati에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Gregorio Dati was a successful merchant of Florence, 
who entered into many profitable partnerships dealing in 
wool, silk, and other merchandise. His career, however, 
especially early on, knew the vicissitudes characteristic of 
Renaissance business. For example, while he was en 
route to Spain as his enterprise’s traveling partner, a role 
typical for young men, pirates robbed him of all his 
goods, including a consignment of pearls, and of his own 
clothes. His recovery from such losses followed in part 
from four successive marriages. Later in life, he was 
honored to serve a number of posts in the city 
government. Over the years he wrote a “diary,” actually 
an occasional record in which he kept accounts of his 
commercial and family life. Men of his kind pioneered 
this form of writing about the public and private self.
