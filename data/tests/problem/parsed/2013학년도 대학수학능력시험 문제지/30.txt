Researchers have suggested that maintaining good social 
relations depends on two ① complementary processes: 
being sensitive to the needs of others and being motivated 
to make amends or pay compensation when a violation 
does occur. In short, maintaining good social relations 
depends on the ② capacity for guilt. Martin L. Hoffman, 
who has focused on the guilt that comes from harming 
others, suggests that the motivational basis for this guilt 
is empathetic distress. Empathetic distress occurs when 
people ③ deny that their actions have caused harm or 
pain to another person. Motivated by feelings of guilt,  
they are ④ inclined  to make amends for their actions. 
Making amends serves to repair damaged social relations 
and ⑤ restore group harmony.
