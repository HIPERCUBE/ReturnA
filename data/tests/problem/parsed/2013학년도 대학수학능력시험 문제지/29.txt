29. In physics, scientists invent models, or theories, to 
describe and predict the data we observe about the 
universe. Newton’s theory of gravity is one example; 
Einstein’s theory of gravity is another. Those theories, 
though they describe the same phenomenon, constitute 
very different versions of reality. Newton, (A) , 
imagined that masses affect each other by exerting a 
force, while in Einstein’s theory the effects occur through 
a bending of space and time and there is no concept of 
gravity as a force. Either theory could be employed to 
describe, with great accuracy, the falling of an apple, but 
Newton’s would be much easier to use. (B) , for 
the calculations necessary for the satellite-based global 
positioning system (GPS) that helps you navigate while 
driving, Newton’s theory would give the wrong answer, 
and so Einstein’s must be used.
