But now rock radio is in seemingly terminal decline and 
MTV doesn’t show many music videos anymore.
Once upon a time, there was only one way to launch a 
hit album: radio. Nothing else reached as many people, as 
often. Getting on a radio playlist was difficult, but once 
a song was in heavy rotation on the radio, it had a high 
probability of selling. Then, in the 1980s, came MTV, 
which became the second way to create a hit. ( ① ) It 
had even more limited capacity for new music, but its 
influence over a generation was unparalleled. ( ② ) For 
the music labels, those were good times; it was a brutally 
competitive business, but it was a business they knew.  
( ③ ) They understood the rules, and they could earn 
their keep by working them. ( ④ ) So how to market 
music? ( ⑤ ) Labels know the answer lies online, 
tapping the word-of-mouth forces that are replacing 
traditional marketing in creating demand, but they’re still 
trying to figure out exactly how best to do it.
