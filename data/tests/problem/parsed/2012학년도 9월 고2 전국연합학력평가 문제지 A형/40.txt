How do young trees begin? Trees make seeds that
grow into saplings and they then grow into trees. Some
seeds are fruits such as apples or cherries. Other seeds
are nuts such as walnuts and chestnuts.
(A) When the pine cone gets wet, the shell shrinks,
keeping the inner seed nice and dry. Then when the
cone dries, the shell expands, opening up to let the
wind blow the seed away so it can grow somewhere
else.
(B) But seeds face many dangers. Animals like to eat
fruit and nuts. And high winds and heavy rain can
make seeds go bad or fall off the tree too soon.
Those factors make it hard for seeds to grow into
saplings.
(C) So trees have evolved clever ways to keep their
seeds safe from hungry animals and bad weather so
that the seeds can eventually find good soil and
grow. A pine tree hides its seeds in cones―a shell
that can expand and contract with water.
