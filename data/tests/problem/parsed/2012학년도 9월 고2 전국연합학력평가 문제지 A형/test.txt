Did you know that approximately fifty thousand dogs
are abandoned in Korea every year? Some of them are
protected in animal shelters waiting for a chance to be a
new friend again. Some people think shelter dogs are all
unhealthier than pet store animals, but it is untrue.
Shelter dogs are vaccinated and many are used to being
around people and other dogs. They are lovable and
wonderful pets just waiting for a new home. Yet, half of
them are euthanized because no one will adopt them. If
you have your heart set on a pet dog, before you check
out a pet store, think about it one more time. Saving just
one dog won’t change the world, but surely it will
change the world for that one dog.
*euthanize 안락사시키다

Thursday, September 6th
Dear diary,
Today was a long day. While waiting for the bus
to depart from summer camp, I wanted to listen to
music. But I couldn’t find my mp3 player. It was a
beloved birthday present from my dad. I searched
all of my bags and pockets. I couldn’t find it
anywhere! I rushed to the camp office and asked
the manager if it had been handed in. He said no.
I came back to the bus with a broken heart. When
I was on the bus about to leave, someone stopped
it. It was the camp manager! He got on the bus
and approached me. In his hand was my mp3
player. He said a cleaning woman had found it
under the sofa in the cabin. I embraced him like I
was celebrating my birthday all over again.
① disappointed → delighted ② satisfied → embarrassed
③ confused → sympathetic ④ discouraged → upset
⑤ comforted → excited

Architecture is art. Every work is a work of art and
architecture is the greatest of the arts. It involves a kind
of thinking that other arts don’t even deal with. It
includes the relationship of the work to the individual
human being―the person who uses it; the person who
sees it; and how that person perceives that space. So
architects need a strong artistic sense and drawing skills.
① Some degree of artistic ability is natural talent, but
people really do get better with practice. ②One way to
build your artistic sense is by sketching the things around
you. ③Visit your town or city center, find a quiet place
to sit undisturbed, and notice how each building fits into
the view of a city. ④The center provides a variety of
programs to improve your artistic skill. ⑤Sketch the
ones that please you, or add your own fantasy buildings
to the skyline.

Bear Lake Road is one of the most popular scenic roads
in Rocky Mountain National Park and provides year-round
visitor access to a variety of wonderful recreational
opportunities. The park maintains this road throughout the
winter to support snowshoeing and cross-country skiing
activities. Bear Lake Road is showing its age! This narrow
road was constructed in 1928 when annual visitation to the
park was about 250,000. Today, well over 3 million people
visit the park each year. Approximately one million visitors
drive the Bear Lake Road annually, far exceeding the
capacity of this 75-year-old route. Road improvements are
needed to correct structural problems in the roadway,
provide a safe and pleasant driving experience, and
facilitate existing and future shuttle bus operations.

28. Bullying is any behavior that hurts or is violent toward
another person. It may be verbal or physical. While it is
often considered to be simply “normal kid stuff,” it can
severely damage the emotional health of the victim. Children
often don’t tell anyone because of fear of what may happen.
It is essential that parents talk to their children on a regular
basis about not only their schoolwork and friends but also
their safety. Parents should ask their children direct
questions about what’s going on at school and how they feel
about it. If parents have ongoing with their
children, when big issues come up, their sons and daughters
will feel safe talking to them about their problems. Create a
safe, loving environment in which kids can talk.
① communication ② disconnection ③ conflicts
④ exercise ⑤ tension
29. A man was sightseeing at Niagara Falls. He was so
thirsty that he drank some of the water from the falls, but
as he turned around, he noticed a sign that said, “Poisson.”
He thought that he had drunk poison, and suddenly felt a
sharp stomach pain. Other tourists saw how the man was
suffering and quickly took him to the hospital. However,
when the physician heard the man’s story, he only laughed.
The doctor said, “Sir, what you saw on that sign wasn’t the
English word, ‘poison,’ but the French word ‘poisson.’ The
word was ‘fishing’ or in other words the sign meant, ‘Do not
fish.’” At the doctor’s explanation, the stomach pains that the
man had been feeling and he went home as if
nothing had happened.
① spread ② occurred ③ restarted
④ continued ⑤ disappeared
30. We cannot solve life’s problems unless we solve them
ourselves. This statement may seem self-evident, yet it is
seemingly beyond the comprehension of much of the human
race. This is because we must before
we can solve it. We cannot solve a problem by saying “It’s
not my problem.” We cannot solve a problem by hoping that
someone else will solve it for us. I can solve a problem only
when I say “This is my problem and it’s up to me to solve
it.” But many, so many, seek to avoid the pain of their
problems by saying to themselves: “This problem was
caused by other people, or by social circumstances beyond
my control, and therefore it is up to other people or society
to solve this problem for me. It is not really my personal
problem.” [3점]
① see a problem as something beyond our control
② find someone else to blame for a problem
③ avoid reacting emotionally to a problem
④ focus on the problem, not the person
⑤ accept responsibility for a problem
31. We all take for granted that colds and other illnesses
have physical causes, such as a virus or bacterium. But
we cannot always blame those disease agents for being
sick. We need to take responsibility. Being under too
much stress limits our ability to fight the viruses and
bacteria all around us, because it weakens our immune
responses. When the body’s resources are consumed by
the stress response, we have no defenses left to battle
real enemies within. It’s a scientific fact that colds and
flu occur more often and with a slower recovery time in
people under stress. Research has proven this with
students at exam time, elderly people at the death of a
spouse or friend, accountants during tax season, and
military personnel during combat. The stress response
explains why people under stress .
[3점]
① get sick more often
② become angry easily
③ avoid interpersonal relationships
④ feel more responsibility for their tasks
⑤ show better performance at exam time

are, (B) , sneaky hunters. Whether they are small

We all know we should be walking

There’s a lot of evidence that strong communities have
less crime and survive disasters better. Here’s an example:
the environmentalist film maker Judith Helfand is making a
film about a massive heat wave in Chicago in 1995 that
killed about six hundred people. She explains that the
victims had one thing in common: they were socially
isolated. They didn’t have friends or family or trusted
neighbors to notice that they hadn’t been out of their house
lately, or to check that their air conditioners were working
well. In fact, three-quarters of Americans don’t know their
neighbors. Judith argues that the best way to prevent
deaths from future heat waves is not having a policy of
handing out discount air conditioner coupons, but providing
community-building activities that strengthen social ties
throughout the year.
① ways to take care of victims of crime
② the necessity of building strong social bonds
③ the relationship of one’s social status and health
④ factors that affect the occurrence of natural disasters
⑤ the importance of raising funds for the socially isolated

The environmental benefits of recycling are obvious. But
focusing on the wrong end of the issue can point our efforts
in the wrong direction. At a recycling conference, I learned
about the Recycle Bank, a program that weighs residents’
recycling bins and awards people points for heavier bins.
That means the neighbor who buys cases of single-serving
bottled water gets points over the one who installed a filter
and drinks tap water in reusable containers! Similar
ridiculous situations are happening any place where people
are measuring progress by an increase in recycling rather
than a decrease in waste. Programs like this give recycling
a bad name by encouraging more consumption and more
waste. They support the generation of disposable products.

If you’ve ever driven by a wind farm,
you may have noticed that the turbines
most likely have three blades. Not two,
not four, but three. There are a few
reasons behind that. If you have too
many blades on a wind turbine, each
blade as it moves through the air leaves
a whirlpool behind it. If these whirlpools
interfere with one another, that can
cause problems with efficiency. However,
if you have a turbine with two blades, it
can’t capture as much energy from the
<wind turbines > wind as a three-blade turbine can. It
also suffers from a dynamic imbalance;
the two blades may receive higher wind speeds at the top
than the bottom. This causes a vibration problem and
vibrations in wind turbines are undesirable. Therefore, we
come to the three-blade wind turbines, which solve all the
problems mentioned above. *whirlpool 소용돌이

② How Many Blades Are Practical?
③ Wind: The Best Alternative Energy

[44～45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
A young boy and his father were out for a walk when
they came across a huge rock in the road. The curious little
boy looked up at his father and asked, “Dad, do you think I
can move that big rock?” His father looked at his son
thoughtfully and then answered, “If you use all your
strength, I know you can.” So the little boy ran over, and
tried with all his strength to move the huge rock, but of
course, could not. Discouraged, he looked up at his father
and said, “You’re wrong, Dad. I can’t do it.” To this his
father replied, “Oh, but you didn’t use all your strength. You
didn’t ask me to help you.” As the young boy discovered,
you don’t have to face obstacles alone.
Often we make the assumption that we can do all things
alone, when in reality our strength comes from reaching out.
When you can use a helping hand to “lift” an obstacle out
of your path, you your strength by asking for
help and assistance. Some problems may be solved easily
with the help of others. In difficult times look around, and
you will find many people ready to help you.
