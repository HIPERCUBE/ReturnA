Architecture is art. Every work is a work of art and
architecture is the greatest of the arts. It involves a kind
of thinking that other arts don’t even deal with. It
includes the relationship of the work to the individual
human being―the person who uses it; the person who
sees it; and how that person perceives that space. So
architects need a strong artistic sense and drawing skills.
① Some degree of artistic ability is natural talent, but
people really do get better with practice. ②One way to
build your artistic sense is by sketching the things around
you. ③Visit your town or city center, find a quiet place
to sit undisturbed, and notice how each building fits into
the view of a city. ④The center provides a variety of
programs to improve your artistic skill. ⑤Sketch the
ones that please you, or add your own fantasy buildings
to the skyline.
