28. Bullying is any behavior that hurts or is violent toward
another person. It may be verbal or physical. While it is
often considered to be simply “normal kid stuff,” it can
severely damage the emotional health of the victim. Children
often don’t tell anyone because of fear of what may happen.
It is essential that parents talk to their children on a regular
basis about not only their schoolwork and friends but also
their safety. Parents should ask their children direct
questions about what’s going on at school and how they feel
about it. If parents have ongoing with their
children, when big issues come up, their sons and daughters
will feel safe talking to them about their problems. Create a
safe, loving environment in which kids can talk.
