A young boy and his father were out for a walk when
they came across a huge rock in the road. The curious little
boy looked up at his father and asked, “Dad, do you think I
can move that big rock?” His father looked at his son
thoughtfully and then answered, “If you use all your
strength, I know you can.” So the little boy ran over, and
tried with all his strength to move the huge rock, but of
course, could not. Discouraged, he looked up at his father
and said, “You’re wrong, Dad. I can’t do it.” To this his
father replied, “Oh, but you didn’t use all your strength. You
didn’t ask me to help you.” As the young boy discovered,
you don’t have to face obstacles alone.
Often we make the assumption that we can do all things
alone, when in reality our strength comes from reaching out.
When you can use a helping hand to “lift” an obstacle out
of your path, you your strength by asking for
help and assistance. Some problems may be solved easily
with the help of others. In difficult times look around, and
you will find many people ready to help you.
