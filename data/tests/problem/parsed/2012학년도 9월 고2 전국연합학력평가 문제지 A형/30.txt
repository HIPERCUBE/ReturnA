30. We cannot solve life’s problems unless we solve them
ourselves. This statement may seem self-evident, yet it is
seemingly beyond the comprehension of much of the human
race. This is because we must before
we can solve it. We cannot solve a problem by saying “It’s
not my problem.” We cannot solve a problem by hoping that
someone else will solve it for us. I can solve a problem only
when I say “This is my problem and it’s up to me to solve
it.” But many, so many, seek to avoid the pain of their
problems by saying to themselves: “This problem was
caused by other people, or by social circumstances beyond
my control, and therefore it is up to other people or society
to solve this problem for me. It is not really my personal
problem.” [3점]
