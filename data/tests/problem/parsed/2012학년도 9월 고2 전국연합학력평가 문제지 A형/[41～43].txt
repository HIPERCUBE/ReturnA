(A)
Moshi, one of my fellow volunteers, a girl from Tanzania,
seemed a bit desperate, so I asked what the problem was.
(a) She told me she had a friend back home who was
having some financial difficulties. So she had sent all her
pocket money for the month to Tanzania to support her
friend!
(B)
So I went to the fair trade shop in town to buy some
food for her. While picking up some stuff, I happened to talk
to a woman working in the shop about my friend, Moshi.
Amazed by the story, the woman asked me, “Does (b) she
like pasta?” I replied, “Yes.” She immediately filled up a bag
with pasta, cookies and other things. “Give her this for me.
It’s my treat!”
(C)
I couldn’t believe (c) her kindness but cried with happiness.
Imagine my friend’s face when she saw the unexpected gift. I
have never seen her so happy! A few weeks later (d) she
found the food giver and thanked her in person. They showed
me what true kindness and compassion is.
(D)
This meant that Moshi didn’t have much food to eat or
money to go anywhere. We got free lunch at work during
weekdays, but everyone knew this wasn’t enough. I was so
touched that she did this for (e) her friend and I felt I had
to do something.
