Thursday, September 6th
Dear diary,
Today was a long day. While waiting for the bus
to depart from summer camp, I wanted to listen to
music. But I couldn’t find my mp3 player. It was a
beloved birthday present from my dad. I searched
all of my bags and pockets. I couldn’t find it
anywhere! I rushed to the camp office and asked
the manager if it had been handed in. He said no.
I came back to the bus with a broken heart. When
I was on the bus about to leave, someone stopped
it. It was the camp manager! He got on the bus
and approached me. In his hand was my mp3
player. He said a cleaning woman had found it
under the sofa in the cabin. I embraced him like I
was celebrating my birthday all over again.
