There’s a lot of evidence that strong communities have
less crime and survive disasters better. Here’s an example:
the environmentalist film maker Judith Helfand is making a
film about a massive heat wave in Chicago in 1995 that
killed about six hundred people. She explains that the
victims had one thing in common: they were socially
isolated. They didn’t have friends or family or trusted
neighbors to notice that they hadn’t been out of their house
lately, or to check that their air conditioners were working
well. In fact, three-quarters of Americans don’t know their
neighbors. Judith argues that the best way to prevent
deaths from future heat waves is not having a policy of
handing out discount air conditioner coupons, but providing
community-building activities that strengthen social ties
throughout the year.
