Bear Lake Road is one of the most popular scenic roads
in Rocky Mountain National Park and provides year-round
visitor access to a variety of wonderful recreational
opportunities. The park maintains this road throughout the
winter to support snowshoeing and cross-country skiing
activities. Bear Lake Road is showing its age! This narrow
road was constructed in 1928 when annual visitation to the
park was about 250,000. Today, well over 3 million people
visit the park each year. Approximately one million visitors
drive the Bear Lake Road annually, far exceeding the
capacity of this 75-year-old route. Road improvements are
needed to correct structural problems in the roadway,
provide a safe and pleasant driving experience, and
facilitate existing and future shuttle bus operations.
