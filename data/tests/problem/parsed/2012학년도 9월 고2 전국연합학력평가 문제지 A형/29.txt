29. A man was sightseeing at Niagara Falls. He was so
thirsty that he drank some of the water from the falls, but
as he turned around, he noticed a sign that said, “Poisson.”
He thought that he had drunk poison, and suddenly felt a
sharp stomach pain. Other tourists saw how the man was
suffering and quickly took him to the hospital. However,
when the physician heard the man’s story, he only laughed.
The doctor said, “Sir, what you saw on that sign wasn’t the
English word, ‘poison,’ but the French word ‘poisson.’ The
word was ‘fishing’ or in other words the sign meant, ‘Do not
fish.’” At the doctor’s explanation, the stomach pains that the
man had been feeling and he went home as if
nothing had happened.
