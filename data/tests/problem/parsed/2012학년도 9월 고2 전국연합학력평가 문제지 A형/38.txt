If you’ve ever driven by a wind farm,
you may have noticed that the turbines
most likely have three blades. Not two,
not four, but three. There are a few
reasons behind that. If you have too
many blades on a wind turbine, each
blade as it moves through the air leaves
a whirlpool behind it. If these whirlpools
interfere with one another, that can
cause problems with efficiency. However,
if you have a turbine with two blades, it
can’t capture as much energy from the
<wind turbines > wind as a three-blade turbine can. It
also suffers from a dynamic imbalance;
the two blades may receive higher wind speeds at the top
than the bottom. This causes a vibration problem and
vibrations in wind turbines are undesirable. Therefore, we
come to the three-blade wind turbines, which solve all the
problems mentioned above. *whirlpool 소용돌이
