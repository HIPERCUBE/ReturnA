Message from Wilson High School
October, 2012
From the Principal
Dear Wilson Families,
I want to thank you for attending the fall
conferences. Students at Wilson High School are very
proud of all that they ①have learned since the
beginning of this year. Conferences are a wonderful
opportunity to celebrate this success and ②keep
communications between parents and teachers open.
Thanks again for making Wilson a true “Learning
Community!”
Please also remember ③what our most important
fund raiser is coming soon. The Wilson Auction will
take place on November 4th at the Lincoln Center.
We are still in need of volunteers ④ to support this
effort. Every gift of your time really helps! Please
contact Jennifer Johnson at 220-0456 if you are ⑤
interested.
Until next time,
