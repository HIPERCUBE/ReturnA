Did you know that approximately fifty thousand dogs
are abandoned in Korea every year? Some of them are
protected in animal shelters waiting for a chance to be a
new friend again. Some people think shelter dogs are all
unhealthier than pet store animals, but it is untrue.
Shelter dogs are vaccinated and many are used to being
around people and other dogs. They are lovable and
wonderful pets just waiting for a new home. Yet, half of
them are euthanized because no one will adopt them. If
you have your heart set on a pet dog, before you check
out a pet store, think about it one more time. Saving just
one dog won’t change the world, but surely it will
change the world for that one dog.
