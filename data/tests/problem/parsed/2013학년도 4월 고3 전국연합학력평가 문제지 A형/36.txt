Pay is most carefully considered when a person is applying
for a job and considering an offer. In general, people ① accept
offers where the monetary compensation is near the amount
that they were hoping for. Over time, employees often expect
to receive raises and/or bonuses, but these factors are not just
about ②money. Employees want to be compensated fairly for
their work. If they are taking on a heavier workload with more
difficult projects, it is likely they would expect ③ inadequate
compensation for their efforts. Part of this compensation could
be monetary, but often times ④recognition is just as important.
People love to hear they have done a good job. A ⑤promotion
that includes a title change can be just as meaningful, if not
more meaningful than an increase in salary.
