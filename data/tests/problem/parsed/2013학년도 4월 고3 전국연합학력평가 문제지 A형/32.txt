Violet sat back, looked out the window, and watched the wind
softly blow the trees as she nodded off. She awoke to the
sound of a faint but promising whisper from the hospital bed.
She looked at Joseph and saw his lips move ever so slightly.
Violet knew what she had seen and gasped in delight. “Joseph?”
she dared to breathe his name expectantly. Again she heard a
sound and saw his lips move. Violet jumped to her feet. “I hear
you, Joseph! I hear you! Do it again! I hear you! Do it again! I
know you can do it!” By now she had lowered the rail on his
bed and was leaning over so she could see his lips and hear his
voice. The sound came louder and stronger.
