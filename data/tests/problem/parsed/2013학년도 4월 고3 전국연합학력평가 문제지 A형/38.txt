A roof that is completely or partially covered with vegetation
and soil is known as a green roof. ① In urban areas, green roofs
provide wildlife habitat, even on the tops of tall buildings. ② A
city with multiple green roofs provides “stepping stones” of habitat
that enable migrating birds and insects to pass unharmed through
the city. ③Green roofs can also be used to grow vegetable and
fruit crops or to provide an outdoor refuge for people living or
working in the building. ④Moreover, it is difficult to grow
plants because heating costs in winter and cooling costs in
summer increase. ⑤ Green roofs allow urban systems to more
closely resemble the natural systems they have replaced.
