Dear Mr. Wells,
Our family has shopped at your supermarket for
several years. While the staff has always been friendly
and helpful, one of your employees is particularly
outstanding, and I want to tell you how wonderful I
think he is. Freddy, who bags groceries and brings
them out to the car, frequently goes out of his way to
help. Yesterday he finished loading my car and headed
back to the store. I tried to pull out but found myself
stuck in the snow. When he heard my wheels spinning,
Freddy came back and gave me a push. It’s nice to find
someone these days who’s willing to go that extra mile
to please a customer. You ought to know that he is a
terrific employee. That thoughtful young man will be
very successful someday.
Yours truly,
Judy Green
