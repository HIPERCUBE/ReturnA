(A)
The Memorial Day march came to an end. The old veteran’s
body ached from marching, and he began to look for a place
to rest his tired feet. He made his way to a park bench, sat
down, and lowered his head. A young boy passing by saw
(a) him, approached, and said, “Please sir, do you mind if I
ask you what the medals you wear are for? Did you get them
for being a war hero?”
(B)
The old veteran continued, “We wear the medals in their
honor, as a symbol of respect. All veterans wear them on
Memorial Day to show that we will not forget their
sacrifice.” The old veteran climbed to his feet and asked the
boy to stand up. Carefully, he removed the medals and placed
them in the boy’s small hand. (b) He told the boy that he
could keep them, and treasure them, throughout his life.
(C)
The veteran was startled, but he moved over and asked the
boy to sit down. Though he had not expected such an
invitation, the boy eagerly accepted it. “First of all, I was not
a hero,” said the old man. (c) His voice was low and serious.
“But I served with many heroes, ones who never returned
home. It’s important to understand that the real heroes were
the people who gave their lives defending this land.”
(D)
The boy was speechless. He could not speak and he could
hardly move. The old veteran went quietly on (d) his way
leaving the boy standing by the bench. In the distance, the
young boy saw the veteran turn and wave goodbye. He sat
down there alone, with tears welling in his eyes. He never
again saw him, but he always remembered the day (e) he
learned about heroes and received that special gift.
