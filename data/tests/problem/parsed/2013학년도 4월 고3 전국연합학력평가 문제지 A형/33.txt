33. A ratio is a way of expressing the relationship between
one number and another. If there is one teacher to fifty
students, the teacher/student ratio is one to fifty, and the
student/teacher ratio is fifty to one. If a very wealthy prince
were being tutored by fifty teachers, the teacher/student
ratio would be fifty to one, and the student/teacher ratio
would be one to fifty. As you can see, the in
which the numbers are compared is important. That is, if the
arrangement of the two items, teacher and student, changes,
the ratio of the items will change, too.
