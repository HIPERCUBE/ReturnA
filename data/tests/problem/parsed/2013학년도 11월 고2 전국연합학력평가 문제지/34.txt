34. Actors sometimes jump at the chance to play a huge
response to some big news. One character says to another,
“You just won a million dollars!” And the actor immediately
jumps up and down and yells about winning a million dollars.
But what would a person do? Stanislavski, a famous Russian
theater director, spoke of . It often
takes time for a person to process information―whether it’s
very good or very bad. Think back to a time in your life when
some big news was delivered. What did you do? Did you
immediately jump up and down, scream with joy or pain? Or did
you just sit down for a moment, saying nothing? How long did
it take to really understand that you won that award before you
responded? Be a person. Don’t just go for emotion or the
obvious response. [3점]
