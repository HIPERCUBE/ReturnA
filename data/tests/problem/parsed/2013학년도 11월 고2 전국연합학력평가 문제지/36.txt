36. The danger that the human population poses to the
environment is the result of two factors: the (A) of
people and the environmental impact of each person. When
there were few people on Earth and limited technology, the
human impact was primarily local. Even so, people have
affected the environment for a surprisingly long time. It started
with the use of fire to clear land, and it continued, new

civilizations. For example, large areas of North America were
modified by American Indians, who used fire for a variety of
