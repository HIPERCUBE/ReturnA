There is no way that we two-legged creatures can keep up
with many four-legged animals in a head-to-head sprint, but
in recent years, some anthropologists have suggested that the
human species has evolved in such a way as to be built for
marathon running. Researchers from Harvard University and
the University of Utah point to our long legs and short arms as
being suited to running ―necessary for our early
hunter-gatherer lifestyle on the African savannah. More
specifically, the scientists highlight the abundance of tendons in
our legs used little in walking but essential for running; our
large leg joints for shock absorption; and our relative lack of
body hair for minimizing rises in body temperatures. These
characteristics demonstrate that the human body as a whole is
comparatively well suited to endurance running compared to
other animals.
