Bruce Adolphe first met Yo-Yo Ma at the Juilliard School in
New York City. Although Ma was only fifteen years old at the
time, ① he was already an established performer. Even at the
age of seven, ② he had played at the White House. Meanwhile,
Adolphe was a promising young composer who had just written
his first cello piece. ③He had shown a draft of his composition
to a Juilliard instructor, who told him that the piece featured a
chord that was impossible to play. Before Adolphe could
correct the music, however, Ma decided to rehearse the
composition in his dorm room. ④He played through his friend’s
composition, sight-reading the whole thing. And when that
impossible chord came, ⑤he somehow found a way to play it
and his bow was straight across all four strings.
