33. Consider the “power” of a baseball bat. All the energy gained
by the bat is supplied by the batter. The bat is just an
instrument that helps send the ball on its way. If it does its job
well, then we usually say that the bat is powerful. In physics
terms, we should really describe the bat in terms of its
efficiency. An efficient bat would be one that allows the batter
to transfer the energy in his arms to the ball without
in the process. In fact, all
bats are very inefficient in the sense that only a small fraction
of the energy in the arms is given to the ball. Most of that
energy is retained in the bat and in the arms as a result of the
“follow through” after the bat strikes the ball. [3점]
① any friction to the ball
② too much loss of energy
③ decrease of swing speed
④ help from another instrument
⑤ enhancement of physical strength
