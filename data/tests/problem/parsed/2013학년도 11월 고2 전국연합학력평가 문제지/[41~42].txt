In the early fifteenth century, Prince Henry the Navigator of
Portugal sent his sailors to explore Africa and open it to
Portuguese trade. Portuguese expeditions began to work their
way down the western coast, always within sight of land.
Upon reaching Cape Bojador, a rocky stretch of desolate coast
with terrifying currents, the Portuguese sailors would
inevitably turn back, convinced that this was the end of land
and that no ship would ever pass it. Prince Henry sent out 15
expeditions between 1424 and 1434 until finally one
succeeded by sailing a few kilometers out to sea and going
south for a few kilometers, thereby passing the dangerous
rocks and currents.
As a navigation feat, this change of direction was trivial.
While it is true that their ships were not strong and their
navigation tools were primitive, the major barrier was not
technological but the fear of losing sight of land. We can say
that the feat of Christopher Columbus was far more difficult
technically, but he too faced a major barrier of fear, both in
his sponsors and in his crew. Once the Atlantic was crossed,
this fear was swept away and only the reasonable fears of
shipwreck, disease, and sea monsters remained. Many
barriers are of this type. They are not merely unknown, but
unimaginable. Major development can be achieved by having
the courage to recognize and overcome barriers,
just as the Portuguese and Spanish sailors did.
