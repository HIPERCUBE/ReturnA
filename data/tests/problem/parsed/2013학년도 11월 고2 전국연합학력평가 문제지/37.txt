37. A decision can be rational without being right and right
without being rational. This has been illustrated through many
examples in history. (A) , in the battle of Narva (on
the border between Russia and what we now call Estonia) on
20 November 1700, King Carl of Sweden and his 8,000 troops
attacked the Russian army, led by Tsar Peter the Great. The
tsar had about ten times as many troops at his disposal. Most
historians agree that the Swedish attack was irrational, since it
was almost certain to fail. (B) , the Swedes had no
strategic reason for attacking; they could not expect to gain
very much from victory. However, because of an unexpected
snowstorm that blinded the Russian army, the Swedes won.
The battle was over in less than two hours. The Swedes lost
667 men and the Russians approximately 15,000.
