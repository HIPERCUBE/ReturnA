Compare this to the situation that occurs when the same man
is stepping into an elevator and another person steps in front
of him, invading his personal territory.
Psychologists have noted that people driving a car react in a
manner that is often completely unlike their normal social
behavior as regards their territories. ( ① ) It seems that a
car sometimes has　a magnifying effect on the size of a person’s
personal space. ( ② ) In some cases, their territory is
expanded by up to ten times the normal size, so the driver feels
that he has a claim to an area of 9 to 10 meters in front of and
behind his car. ( ③ ) When another driver cuts in front of
him, even if no danger is involved, the driver may go through a
physiological change, becoming angry and out of control. ( ④ )
His reaction in those circumstances is normally apologetic and
he allows the other man to go first. ( ⑤ ) This is remarkably
different from what happens when another driver cuts in front
of him on the open road.
