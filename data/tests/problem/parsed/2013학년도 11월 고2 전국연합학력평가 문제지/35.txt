35. There is no frame-free way to evaluate anything. Consider
this example. College students were asked whether they would
support a multimillion-dollar safety measure that would save
150 lives at risk. Is 150 lives a lot or a little? Well, compared
with what? Other students were asked whether they would
support a safety measure that would save 98 percent of 150
lives at risk. These students were more favorable toward it
than the students who were told it would save 150 lives.
Obviously, saving 150 lives is better than saving 98 percent of
150 lives, but a measure that saved 98 percent of the lives
seems clearly cost-effective. The 98 percent figure provides
the students with a frame that 150 lives by itself does not.
Whether the money spent on safety is seen as a wise decision
or not will depend on . When
people are told that a safety measure will save 98 percent of
150 lives, a frame is created between 150 lives and 98 percent
of 150 lives. [3점]
