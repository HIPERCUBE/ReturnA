When was the last time you dreamed? I’m not talking about
what went down last night while you were sleeping. I’m talking
about really letting your mind think over something major you
want to make happen in your life. Can’t remember? Don’t have
time for such follies? You need to change that, starting today.
Sounds obvious, but the first step toward making a dream come
true is to actually have a dream. At some point in your life, you
probably wanted something with your whole heart and it didn’t
happen. And that hurt. You might have stopped dreaming.
Maybe you didn’t do it consciously, but you began to avoid
letting yourself go after scary goals. It’s a universal occurrence
― it happens to almost everyone. But you can overcome this
common limitation and start dreaming again.
