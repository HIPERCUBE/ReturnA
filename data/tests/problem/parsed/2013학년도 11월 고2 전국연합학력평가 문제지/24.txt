Many predators direct their initial attack at the head of their
prey. Some prey species have taken advantage of this tendency
by evolving false heads located at their posterior end.
Individuals of the species Thecla togarna, for example, possess
a false head with dummy antennae at the tips of their
hindwings. Upon landing, the butterfly moves its hindwings, and
thereby the dummy antennae up and down while keeping the
true antennae motionless. Thecla togarna’s second trick occurs
at the instant of landing when the butterfly quickly turns so
that its false head points in the direction of previous flight. An
approaching predator is thus confronted with a prey that
flutters off in the direction opposite to that expected.
Experimental tests have demonstrated that markings associated
with false heads misdirect the attacks of avian predators and
increase the possibility of escape of the prey.
