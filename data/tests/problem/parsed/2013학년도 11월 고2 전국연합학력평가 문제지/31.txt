humans. In 1773, the Scottish writer James Boswell, noting
that “no beast is a cook,” called Homo sapiens “the cooking
animal.” Fifty years later, in The Physiology of Taste, the
French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin claimed that
cooking made us who we are; by teaching men to use fire, it
had “done the most to advance the cause of civilization.” More
recently, Lévi-Strauss, writing in The Raw and the Cooked in
1964, reported that many of the world’s cultures entertained a
similar view, regarding cooking as the symbolic activity that
“establishes the difference between animals and people.”
