(A)
Two boys were playing on a beach, seeing who could skim
a rock out the farthest. This was their vacation, and it was
good to find the sea flat this morning, particularly after
several days of wild storms when the sea had been whipped
up to a frenzy. Turbulent waves and high tides had washed
lots of poor sea creatures ashore. The boys found
themselves walking through jellyfish, starfish, crabs, and
other little animals that coated the beach like a dying
blanket.
(B)
Slowly dropping her hands a little lower, she let the little
creature feel the refreshing touch of the sea. The octopus
spread its tentacles as if feeling good to be back home once
again. Supportively, the girl’s hands cupped the young animal
until it gathered the strength and propelled itself forward in
the water. She stood watching, a faint smile on her face at
the pleasure of seeing another creature safely on its way.
Only then did she turn and retrace her steps to the shore.
Finally, she seemed to notice the laughing boys. Looking
them in the eye, she said, “It sure made a difference for that
one!”
(C)
At the end of the beach the boys noticed a girl frequently
wading in and out of the water. Curious to see what she was
doing, they headed off in her direction. As they got closer,
they saw that she would bend down and pick up one of the
sea creatures. She cradled it gently in her hands, waded out
into the water, and released it back in its home. Then she
returned to the shore, picked up yet another creature, and
gently carried it back into the water.
(D)
The boys began to laugh. It was just the sort of silly stuff
they could expect a girl do. “Hey,” they called out, “what are
you doing? Can’t you see you ain’t gonna make any
difference? The beach is covered with thousands of dead and
dying creatures.” And they laughed some more. The girl
seemed to ignore them at first. She picked up a
lifeless-looking young octopus, nursed it carefully in her
hands, and walked back into the ocean as if the boys didn’t
exist. She lowered the octopus into the water, tenderly
washing away the sand and seaweed that had collected over
it and entangled its tentacles.
