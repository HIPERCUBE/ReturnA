Vivian Malone Jones was the first African-American woman
who entered the University of Alabama in 1963, along with
fellow black student James Hood. Their entry resulted in then
Governor George Wallace standing in the door of the university
in an attempt to halt their admission. They entered the
university but only after an agreement was reached between
the White House and Wallace’s aides. Ms. Jones further
distinguished herself as the first African-American to graduate
from the University of Alabama in 1965. She moved to
Washington, DC and joined the U.S. Department of Justice as a
staff member of its Voter Education Project. Following that
assignment, she moved to Atlanta and took a position with the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where she was
director of civil rights and urban affairs. She retired in 1996
remaining active in civil rights organizations.
