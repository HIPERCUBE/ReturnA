When was the last time you dreamed? I’m not talking about
what went down last night while you were sleeping. I’m talking
about really letting your mind think over something major you
want to make happen in your life. Can’t remember? Don’t have
time for such follies? You need to change that, starting today.
Sounds obvious, but the first step toward making a dream come
true is to actually have a dream. At some point in your life, you
probably wanted something with your whole heart and it didn’t
happen. And that hurt. You might have stopped dreaming.
Maybe you didn’t do it consciously, but you began to avoid
letting yourself go after scary goals. It’s a universal occurrence
― it happens to almost everyone. But you can overcome this
common limitation and start dreaming again.
* folly: 어리석은행위
①타인과꿈을공유하면꿈을이루기쉽다.
② 꿈을자주변경하는것은위험할수있다.
③ 꿈을이루기위해서는우선꿈을가져야한다.

⑤ 실현가능한작은꿈부터실천하기시작해야한다.
24.다음글의주제로가장적절한것은?
Many predators direct their initial attack at the head of their
prey. Some prey species have taken advantage of this tendency
by evolving false heads located at their posterior end.
Individuals of the species Thecla togarna, for example, possess
a false head with dummy antennae at the tips of their
hindwings. Upon landing, the butterfly moves its hindwings, and
thereby the dummy antennae up and down while keeping the
true antennae motionless. Thecla togarna’s second trick occurs
at the instant of landing when the butterfly quickly turns so
that its false head points in the direction of previous flight. An
approaching predator is thus confronted with a prey that
flutters off in the direction opposite to that expected.
Experimental tests have demonstrated that markings associated
with false heads misdirect the attacks of avian predators and
increase the possibility of escape of the prey.
* avian: 조류의
① various landing skills of small flying animals
② strategic behaviors of birds to find their preys
③ negative aspects of disguising the head of insects
④ survival strategies of prey species using a false head
⑤ complementary relationships between birds and insects

There is no way that we two-legged creatures can keep up
with many four-legged animals in a head-to-head sprint, but
in recent years, some anthropologists have suggested that the
human species has evolved in such a way as to be built for
marathon running. Researchers from Harvard University and
the University of Utah point to our long legs and short arms as
being suited to running ―necessary for our early
hunter-gatherer lifestyle on the African savannah. More
specifically, the scientists highlight the abundance of tendons in
our legs used little in walking but essential for running; our
large leg joints for shock absorption; and our relative lack of
body hair for minimizing rises in body temperatures. These
characteristics demonstrate that the human body as a whole is
comparatively well suited to endurance running compared to
other animals.

26.밑줄친 He[he]가 가리키는대상이 나머지넷과 다른것은?
Bruce Adolphe first met Yo-Yo Ma at the Juilliard School in
New York City. Although Ma was only fifteen years old at the
time, ① he was already an established performer. Even at the
age of seven, ② he had played at the White House. Meanwhile,
Adolphe was a promising young composer who had just written
his first cello piece. ③He had shown a draft of his composition
to a Juilliard instructor, who told him that the piece featured a
chord that was impossible to play. Before Adolphe could
correct the music, however, Ma decided to rehearse the
composition in his dorm room. ④He played through his friend’s
composition, sight-reading the whole thing. And when that
impossible chord came, ⑤he somehow found a way to play it
and his bow was straight across all four strings.

An ambiguous term is one which has more than a single
meaning and ①whose context does not clearly indicate which
meaning is intended. For instance, a sign posted at a fork in a
trail which ② reads “Bear To The Right” can be understood in
two ways. The more probable meaning is that it is instructing
hikers to take the right trail, not the left. But let us ③ say that
the ranger who painted the sign meant to say just the opposite.
He was trying to warn hikers against taking the right trail
because there is a bear in the area through which it passes.
The ranger’s language was therefore careless, and open to
misinterpretation ④what could have serious consequences.
The only way to avoid ambiguity is to spell things out as
⑤ explicitly as possible: “Keep left. Do not use trail to the
right. Bears in the area.”

If you place in a bottle half a dozen bees and the same number
of flies, and lay the bottle down horizontally, with its base to the
window, you will find that the bees will (A) delay / continue
their endeavor to look for an exit through the glass till they die
of exhaustion; while the flies will soon escape the bottle through
the neck on the opposite side. It is the bees’ love of light, it is
their very intelligence, that causes their (B) success / failure in
this experiment. They evidently imagine that the exit from every
prison must be there where the light shines clearest; and they act
in accordance, and they persist in too logical action. The flies are
careless of logic. They flutter wildly here and there disregarding
the call of the light and end up (C) ignoring / discovering the
opening that restores their liberty to them.
(A) (B) (C)
① delay …… success …… discovering
② delay …… failure …… ignoring
③ continue …… failure …… discovering
④ continue …… failure …… ignoring
⑤ continue …… success …… discovering

30. Vivian Malone Jones에관한다음글의내용과일치하지않는것은?
Vivian Malone Jones was the first African-American woman
who entered the University of Alabama in 1963, along with
fellow black student James Hood. Their entry resulted in then
Governor George Wallace standing in the door of the university
in an attempt to halt their admission. They entered the
university but only after an agreement was reached between
the White House and Wallace’s aides. Ms. Jones further
distinguished herself as the first African-American to graduate
from the University of Alabama in 1965. She moved to
Washington, DC and joined the U.S. Department of Justice as a
staff member of its Voter Education Project. Following that
assignment, she moved to Atlanta and took a position with the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where she was
director of civil rights and urban affairs. She retired in 1996
remaining active in civil rights organizations.

⑤ 은퇴후에도인권단체에서활동했다.


35. There is no frame-free way to evaluate anything. Consider
this example. College students were asked whether they would
support a multimillion-dollar safety measure that would save
150 lives at risk. Is 150 lives a lot or a little? Well, compared
with what? Other students were asked whether they would
support a safety measure that would save 98 percent of 150
lives at risk. These students were more favorable toward it
than the students who were told it would save 150 lives.
Obviously, saving 150 lives is better than saving 98 percent of
150 lives, but a measure that saved 98 percent of the lives
seems clearly cost-effective. The 98 percent figure provides
the students with a frame that 150 lives by itself does not.
Whether the money spent on safety is seen as a wise decision
or not will depend on . When
people are told that a safety measure will save 98 percent of
150 lives, a frame is created between 150 lives and 98 percent
of 150 lives. [3점]
① the analysis of the input
② the context of comparison
③ the expectation of investors
④ the effort of risk management
⑤ the background of respondents

36. The danger that the human population poses to the
environment is the result of two factors: the (A) of
people and the environmental impact of each person. When
there were few people on Earth and limited technology, the
human impact was primarily local. Even so, people have
affected the environment for a surprisingly long time. It started
with the use of fire to clear land, and it continued, new
research shows, with large effects on the environment by early
civilizations. For example, large areas of North America were
modified by American Indians, who used fire for a variety of
reasons and modified the forests of the eastern United States.
The problem now is that there are so many people and our
technologies are so powerful that our effects on the
environment are even more (B) . This could cause a
negative feedback― the more people, the worse the
environment; the worse the environment, the fewer people. [3점]
(A) (B)
① number …… global
② number …… limited
③ knowledge …… positive
④ movement …… accidental
⑤ movement …… exaggerated
37. A decision can be rational without being right and right
without being rational. This has been illustrated through many
examples in history. (A) , in the battle of Narva (on
the border between Russia and what we now call Estonia) on
20 November 1700, King Carl of Sweden and his 8,000 troops
attacked the Russian army, led by Tsar Peter the Great. The
tsar had about ten times as many troops at his disposal. Most
historians agree that the Swedish attack was irrational, since it
was almost certain to fail. (B) , the Swedes had no
strategic reason for attacking; they could not expect to gain
very much from victory. However, because of an unexpected
snowstorm that blinded the Russian army, the Swedes won.
The battle was over in less than two hours. The Swedes lost
667 men and the Russians approximately 15,000.
(A) (B)
① For instance …… Moreover
② For instance …… Therefore
③ Furthermore …… Therefore
④ However …… Similarly
⑤ However …… Moreover

We’re creatures of habit. In all the years I’ve been hearing
that old expression, I’ve never heard anyone dispute it.
Probably because there’s so much truth to it.
(A) While someone might argue that particular figure, I doubt
that anyone would disagree that our habits have a powerful
hold on us. Most of them start innocently and
unintentionally. At the beginning they form a kind of
invisible thread.
(B) In fact, we’re even more the result of habit than most
people realize. Some psychologists believe that up to
ninety-five percent of our behavior is formed through
habit.
(C) But through repetition, that thread becomes twisted into a
cord and later into a rope. Each time we repeat an act, we
add to it and strengthen it. The rope becomes a chain and
then a cable. Eventually, we become our habits.

Compare this to the situation that occurs when the same man
is stepping into an elevator and another person steps in front
of him, invading his personal territory.
Psychologists have noted that people driving a car react in a
manner that is often completely unlike their normal social
behavior as regards their territories. ( ① ) It seems that a
car sometimes has　a magnifying effect on the size of a person’s
personal space. ( ② ) In some cases, their territory is
expanded by up to ten times the normal size, so the driver feels
that he has a claim to an area of 9 to 10 meters in front of and
behind his car. ( ③ ) When another driver cuts in front of
him, even if no danger is involved, the driver may go through a
physiological change, becoming angry and out of control. ( ④ )
His reaction in those circumstances is normally apologetic and
he allows the other man to go first. ( ⑤ ) This is remarkably
different from what happens when another driver cuts in front
of him on the open road.

One of the companies I work with gets thousands of calls
every day to its customer support center. Sometimes the
problems can be solved right away, but often the service
representative has to look into the matter and call back later.
When the company subsequently surveyed its customers to
see how satisfied they had been with the support center, one
of the results was something intriguing: 58 percent of
customers whose problem had been solved right away
remembered that their call had been answered “immediately”
or “very quickly,” while only 4 percent remembered having
been kept waiting “too long.” Meanwhile, of those customers
whose problem had not been solved right away, only 36
percent remembered their call had been answered
“immediately” or “very quickly,” while 18 percent recalled
they had waited “too long.” In fact, the company had an
automated answering system and there was no difference in
waiting time between the two groups.
According to the survey, whether a customer’s problem was
solved (A) or not had an impact on the customer’s
(B) of how fast the phone call had been answered.
(A) (B)
① completely …… response
② completely …… evaluation
③ previously …… curiosity
④ immediately …… perception
⑤ immediately …… expectation
[41~42] 다음글을읽고,물음에답하시오.
In the early fifteenth century, Prince Henry the Navigator of
Portugal sent his sailors to explore Africa and open it to
Portuguese trade. Portuguese expeditions began to work their
way down the western coast, always within sight of land.
Upon reaching Cape Bojador, a rocky stretch of desolate coast
with terrifying currents, the Portuguese sailors would
inevitably turn back, convinced that this was the end of land
and that no ship would ever pass it. Prince Henry sent out 15
expeditions between 1424 and 1434 until finally one
succeeded by sailing a few kilometers out to sea and going
south for a few kilometers, thereby passing the dangerous
rocks and currents.
As a navigation feat, this change of direction was trivial.
While it is true that their ships were not strong and their
navigation tools were primitive, the major barrier was not
technological but the fear of losing sight of land. We can say
that the feat of Christopher Columbus was far more difficult
technically, but he too faced a major barrier of fear, both in
his sponsors and in his crew. Once the Atlantic was crossed,
this fear was swept away and only the reasonable fears of
shipwreck, disease, and sea monsters remained. Many
barriers are of this type. They are not merely unknown, but
unimaginable. Major development can be achieved by having
the courage to recognize and overcome barriers,
just as the Portuguese and Spanish sailors did.

[43~45] 다음글을 읽고, 물음에답하시오.
(A)
Two boys were playing on a beach, seeing who could skim
a rock out the farthest. This was their vacation, and it was
good to find the sea flat this morning, particularly after
several days of wild storms when the sea had been whipped
up to a frenzy. Turbulent waves and high tides had washed
lots of poor sea creatures ashore. The boys found
themselves walking through jellyfish, starfish, crabs, and
other little animals that coated the beach like a dying
blanket.
(B)
Slowly dropping her hands a little lower, she let the little
creature feel the refreshing touch of the sea. The octopus
spread its tentacles as if feeling good to be back home once
again. Supportively, the girl’s hands cupped the young animal
until it gathered the strength and propelled itself forward in
the water. She stood watching, a faint smile on her face at
the pleasure of seeing another creature safely on its way.
Only then did she turn and retrace her steps to the shore.
Finally, she seemed to notice the laughing boys. Looking
them in the eye, she said, “It sure made a difference for that
one!”
(C)
At the end of the beach the boys noticed a girl frequently
wading in and out of the water. Curious to see what she was
doing, they headed off in her direction. As they got closer,
they saw that she would bend down and pick up one of the
sea creatures. She cradled it gently in her hands, waded out
into the water, and released it back in its home. Then she
returned to the shore, picked up yet another creature, and
gently carried it back into the water.
(D)
The boys began to laugh. It was just the sort of silly stuff
they could expect a girl do. “Hey,” they called out, “what are
you doing? Can’t you see you ain’t gonna make any
difference? The beach is covered with thousands of dead and
dying creatures.” And they laughed some more. The girl
seemed to ignore them at first. She picked up a
lifeless-looking young octopus, nursed it carefully in her
hands, and walked back into the ocean as if the boys didn’t
exist. She lowered the octopus into the water, tenderly
washing away the sand and seaweed that had collected over
it and entangled its tentacles.
