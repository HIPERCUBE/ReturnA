27. 다음글의 밑줄친부분 중, 어법상 틀린것은? [3점]
An ambiguous term is one which has more than a single
meaning and ①whose context does not clearly indicate which
meaning is intended. For instance, a sign posted at a fork in a
trail which ② reads “Bear To The Right” can be understood in
two ways. The more probable meaning is that it is instructing
hikers to take the right trail, not the left. But let us ③ say that
the ranger who painted the sign meant to say just the opposite.
He was trying to warn hikers against taking the right trail
because there is a bear in the area through which it passes.
The ranger’s language was therefore careless, and open to
misinterpretation ④what could have serious consequences.
The only way to avoid ambiguity is to spell things out as
⑤ explicitly as possible: “Keep left. Do not use trail to the
right. Bears in the area.”
