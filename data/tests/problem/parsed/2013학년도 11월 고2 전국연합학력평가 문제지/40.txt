One of the companies I work with gets thousands of calls
every day to its customer support center. Sometimes the
problems can be solved right away, but often the service
representative has to look into the matter and call back later.
When the company subsequently surveyed its customers to
see how satisfied they had been with the support center, one
of the results was something intriguing: 58 percent of
customers whose problem had been solved right away
remembered that their call had been answered “immediately”
or “very quickly,” while only 4 percent remembered having
been kept waiting “too long.” Meanwhile, of those customers
whose problem had not been solved right away, only 36
percent remembered their call had been answered
“immediately” or “very quickly,” while 18 percent recalled
they had waited “too long.” In fact, the company had an
automated answering system and there was no difference in
waiting time between the two groups.
According to the survey, whether a customer’s problem was
solved (A) or not had an impact on the customer’s
(B) of how fast the phone call had been answered.
(A) (B)
① completely …… response
② completely …… evaluation

⑤ immediately …… expectation
