A general sales manager, recently promoted, no longer took 
a regular lunch time off. He felt that since his job involved 
more responsibility, he should be available all the time, and 
so he just grabbed a quick sandwich on the run. After several 
weeks of this, he found himself irritable in the afternoon, 
arguing with his colleagues, and having difficulty concentrating 
on important matters. One of these colleagues convinced him 
that he needed a sit-down lunch to restore his energy and 
inner calm. So he began having a more leisurely lunch and 
made certain that nothing interfered with this midday break. 
He developed the practice of going to lunch with a different 
person each day. Some were friends with whom he enjoyed a 
social occasion. Gradually he also lunched with all his 
coworkers and got to know them better. When he had to ask 
them to do something for him or when they were asking him 
for help, he had the benefit of                                         to 
support those quick back-and-forth requests.
He was careful, even though he took a long lunch time, not 
to eat too much, as he found it made him sleepy in the 
afternoon. But as this executive found out, what you eat 
might not be nearly as important as who you eat with and 
what you talk about.
