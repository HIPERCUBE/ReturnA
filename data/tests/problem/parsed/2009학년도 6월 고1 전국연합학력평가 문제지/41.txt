41. On Valentine’s Day, millions of people exchange heart-shaped
gifts of all kinds, from candy to cards. But did you know that
the human heart does not actually look like the typical
valentine shape? The human heart resembles the shape and
size of a fist. The heart is a muscle with lots of blood
supplied to it. In people who are overweight, the heart looks
yellow because it is covered with yellow fat. Most people
have heard that the heart is on the left side of the chest. In
reality, the heart is in the middle of the chest, placed between
the two lungs. To push blood, an average heart beats a
hundred thousand times a day. It means that in a lifetime, the
average human heart will beat more than two and a half
billion times.
