There was another taboo concerning animals.
For the Inuit, it was a taboo to store reindeer and seal meat
together. They could not even eat the two meats on the same
day. ( ① ) They believed the goddess Sedna had separated the
land animals from the sea animals. ( ② ) They thought bringing
these animals together would cause the hunting to be bad. ( ③ )
When a dead seal was brought into the house, everyone had
to stop working. ( ④ ) Then, the spirit of the dead seal had to
be given a drink of water. ( ⑤ ) If it got no water, the spirit
would be angered. It would keep other animals from being
caught.
