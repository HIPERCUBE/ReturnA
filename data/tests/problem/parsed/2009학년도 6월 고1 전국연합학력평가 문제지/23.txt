Babylonia governed themselves according to their own customs.
①When they interacted, however, it often resulted in debates or
violent fights. ② Hammurabi attempted to make his empire
more stable by settling those disagreements. ③ So, he boiled

which all would observe uniformly. ④He forced citizens to do
hard work, including heightening the city walls for defensive
purposes. ⑤As a result, this reduced the potential for conflict
