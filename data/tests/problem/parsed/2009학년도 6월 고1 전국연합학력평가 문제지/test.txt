ancient Egypt to Star Wars, ③ they are a trip through

my side. ④ They may be strangers, but we laugh and cry
together. Movies can be thrilling or joyous. ⑤ They take us
away from our sadness and problems.

For many people, a trip to the grocery store is a fun break in
the day. However, what often happens is that shoppers end up
buying things that are not really needed. Consumers can break
this bad habit by taking half an hour out of the day to do a little
research at the grocery store. Just go around with a pen and
paper and look at what you buy. See whether there are other
options which are less expensive or more specific to your needs.
In the end, it will help you form a really good plan for grocery
shopping and in turn will help stretch your food budget.

The unforgettable musical, Rent, has been performed 5,140
times since the show ① opened in 1996. It generated such
support that fans who saw the production many times came
② to be known as ‘Rent-heads.’ One of the numerous reasons
fans kept coming back ③ are that the characters in the show are
very realistic. Larson wrote Rent based on Puccini’s opera, La
Boheme. But its characters are quite different from ④ those in
the opera. ⑤Upon its opening on Broadway, this show brought
controversy, especially when it came to more conservative,
middle-aged audiences. But after receiving a glowing review
from the press, Rent became the hottest ticket in town.

Prior to Hammurabi’s ruling, the various ethnic groups within
Babylonia governed themselves according to their own customs.
①When they interacted, however, it often resulted in debates or
violent fights. ② Hammurabi attempted to make his empire
more stable by settling those disagreements. ③ So, he boiled
down all the native customs into a single, concrete code of law,
which all would observe uniformly. ④He forced citizens to do
hard work, including heightening the city walls for defensive
purposes. ⑤As a result, this reduced the potential for conflict
among the ethnic groups in Babylonia.

24. ‘Communifaking’ means pretending to be talking or sending
text messages on a cell phone. The most common reason is
for impression management. While waiting for friends, people
fake phone calls so that they are not seen as a lonely person.

to me, I pretended I was talking on my phone while pumping
my gas,” she said.

25. There is an agricultural operation just outside Curitiba that
looks like other farms in other areas. At this farm, the workers
are not experienced farmers. Instead, they are drug addicts and
alcoholics who volunteer to spend up to nine months in a
program called Verde Saude (Green Health). In the program,
they cultivate medicinal plants including chamomile and aloe
vera, and then process a variety of herbal teas, syrups, and
other products that are sold in health-food stores. In exchange
for their labor, the workers receive counseling, medical care,
job training, and a dose of healthy country living to get them
back on their feet. In addition to growing crops, this farm
actually helps the city to .

26. “Money can buy happiness, but only if ,”
reported a team of researchers at the University of British
Columbia. In their experiment, they asked more than 630
Americans to rate their general happiness. They were then
asked to report their annual income and detail their monthly
spending including bills, gifts for themselves, gifts for others
and donations to charity. As its result, it was found that
spending as little as $ 5 a day on others could significantly
boost happiness. “We wanted to test our theory to show that
how money is spent is as important as how much is earned,”
said Elizabeth Dunn, a psychologist from the university.
① you spend it on someone else
② your income covers your spending
③ you get what you’ve really wanted
④ it is used for your self-development
⑤ it comes from your hard work
27. The ‘Zimbabwe hand’ method has been developed to
. As the name implies, all you
need is your hands. For each meal, you eat portions of fruits
and starchy foods equal to your two fists. You eat as many
vegetables as you can place in two hands. The amount of fat
you eat should be no larger than the tip of your thumb. The
portion of protein should be the size of your palm and the

I fell in love with the minister’s son, Robert, the winter I
turned fourteen. When I found out that my parents had invited
the minister’s family over for Christmas Eve dinner, I didn’t
know what to do. What would Robert think of our humble
Christmas? What would he think of my noisy relatives who
lacked proper American manners? Finally, they all arrived ―
the minister’s family and all my relatives. Dinner threw me
deeper into despair. My relatives licked the ends of their
chopsticks, dipping them into the dozen or so dishes of food.
After dinner my father leaned back and belched loudly, which
astonished our guests.

36. ‘snow eater’에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은? [1점]
A ‘snow eater’ is a special wind. It blows only at certain
places and times. One of these places is in the Rocky Mountains.
The special time is most often late winter or early spring. The
mountains are still covered with snow then. One day a wind
comes from the west. The wind blows up the west side of the
mountain. It drops rain there. So it gets drier and drier as it
climbs. Soon the wind reaches the top of the mountain. Cold air
there keeps it from going higher. Then the dry wind starts down
the other side of the mountain. As it travels down, a strange
thing happens. The wind becomes warmer and warmer. The
warm wind melts the snow at the foot of the mountain. This
wind may last only a few hours but sometimes lasts a few days.
① Rocky Mountains에서만 발생한다.
② 늦가을과 초겨울에 주로 일어난다.

In Australia, John Cann carries on his family’s tradition of
reptile shows. His parents started their snake circus in 1919.
Cann’s mother was called Cleopatra after the queen of Egypt
who was lethally bitten by a snake. Both parents survived
their profession and retired in good health. Their son has made
good use of his lifelong experience with snakes. He now
advises the Australia Museum on reptiles and his goal is not
only to entertain, but also to educate his audience on the value
of these reptiles and their important role in the environment.

38. When writers want to convince people of something, they
generally rely on two means of persuasion : appealing to the
reader’s sense of logic and appealing to the reader’s emotions.
When writers rely only on appeals to emotion, they neglect to
provide any real evidence for why readers should believe what
they say. Writers who rely solely on emotional appeals usually
hope to get their readers so angry, scared, or excited that
they will forget to look for reason or sense in the argument.
Unfortunately, many readers aren’t aware of this strategy, so
they may accept arguments that are unfounded, misleading, or
both.
① 충분한 근거를 제시하는 글이 독자들에게 더 인기가 많다.
② 잘 쓰여진 글은 모든 세대의 공감을 얻는다.

⑤ 감정에 호소하는 글은 독자의 판단력을 흐리게 할 수 있다.
39. Koreans put in the longest work hours among the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD)
and their work has always been part of Korea’s economic
success. However, some Korean companies are making an
effort to cut back on work hours for their employees. These
companies say that giving workers more time to rest has
helped their employees to recharge and relax after work,
making them suffer less from burnout and be more productive.
Their strategies may be working, because these companies
record the largest quarterly profit.

41. On Valentine’s Day, millions of people exchange heart-shaped
gifts of all kinds, from candy to cards. But did you know that
the human heart does not actually look like the typical
valentine shape? The human heart resembles the shape and
size of a fist. The heart is a muscle with lots of blood
supplied to it. In people who are overweight, the heart looks
yellow because it is covered with yellow fat. Most people
have heard that the heart is on the left side of the chest. In
reality, the heart is in the middle of the chest, placed between
the two lungs. To push blood, an average heart beats a
hundred thousand times a day. It means that in a lifetime, the
average human heart will beat more than two and a half
billion times.

42. Many species closely associated with the four seasons are
having to cope with higher incidents of poor weather as our
climate becomes more unpredictable. Birds, mammals and
particularly insects have all suffered from a cold, late spring, a
wet summer with little sunshine and a long, dry autumn. This
climate change is having a serious impact on our countryside
every year. The unseasonal weather, however, has brought
some advantages. It led to a spectacular display of red, yellow
and orange autumn leaves. Poor weather in August was
beneficial for certain cabbage butterflies which prospered as
their enemies decreased in number.

For six weeks we had traveled, and still there was no land
in sight. The wide dark sea went on and on and storm
followed storm. Our ship began to leak. Then one day a sailor,
sniffing the air, said, “Land’s ahead.” We dared not believe
him. But soon bits of seaweed floated by. Then a feather from
a land bird. Two days later at dawn I heard the lookout shout,
“Land!” Everyone who was well enough to stand crowded on
deck. Through the gray mist we saw it : a low dark outline
between sea and sky. Land! Tears streamed down my
mother’s face. Then everyone fell to their knees while my
father said a prayer of thanksgiving.

There was another taboo concerning animals.
For the Inuit, it was a taboo to store reindeer and seal meat
together. They could not even eat the two meats on the same
day. ( ① ) They believed the goddess Sedna had separated the
land animals from the sea animals. ( ② ) They thought bringing
these animals together would cause the hunting to be bad. ( ③ )
When a dead seal was brought into the house, everyone had
to stop working. ( ④ ) Then, the spirit of the dead seal had to
be given a drink of water. ( ⑤ ) If it got no water, the spirit
would be angered. It would keep other animals from being
caught.

If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon
and stars, we would go into darkness happily. Instead, we are
diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s
light. We’ve done a lot to the night : We’ve filled it with light.
Its benefits come with consequences called light pollution.
Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design,
which allows artificial light to shine outward and upward into
the sky, where it’s not wanted. Ill-designed lighting radically
changes light levels, and affects some aspects of life : migration,
reproduction, and feeding. For example, endangered leatherback
turtles are guided by the horizon’s natural glow, but light from
a nearby city can lead them to get lost and hit by cars.

① washes away …… the law of nature

(A) I was wiping off my car, waiting for my wife in front
of her office, when I spotted a man approaching me. At
first glance, he looked like a bum. I hoped he would not
ask me for any money. He didn’t. But after a few
minutes he said, “That’s a very pretty car.”
(B) I gave him enough money to get a warm meal and
shelter for the day. I actually had expected nothing, but
he had known a great truth. Maybe a god looked down,
called an angel, dressed him like a bum, and then said,
“Go to that man cleaning the car. He needs help.” Don’t
we all?
(C) He answered in three simple but profound words.
“Don’t we all?” I was feeling high and important, more
than a beggar, until those three words hit me like a
shotgun blast. Maybe not for meals or shelters, but
still I needed help. No matter how much you have, you
will always need help. No matter how little you have,
you can always give help, even if it’s just praise.
(D) I said, “Thanks,” and continued wiping off my car.
He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected
begging never came. As the silence between us
widened, something inside me said, “Ask him if he
needs any help.” I was sure that he would say, “Yes,”
but I held true to the inner voice. “Do you need any
help?” I asked.

[49～50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Many argue that knowledge gives you power. Nevertheless,
we sometimes wish that we were never informed about
something. Why do we feel this way? Do we really need
knowledge to be happy? As for me, it seems that knowing
more often leads to a life of worry and misery. If we never
knew that there were better ways of doing things, then we
wouldn’t feel such a need for them. Knowledge only brings a
want for more. For happiness, therefore, a sense of nothing
would be beneficial. In addition, it is often better to enjoy,
simply accepting the way things are, rather than knowing
how they work. Why do we need water? Why do we need
food? Isn’t it more relaxing just to know that, without them,
you wouldn’t exist?
I’m not saying that knowledge is not good or powerful, but
it just makes me consider whether or not we are truly better
off with it. When I was younger, I found that I was happier
most of the time and it was easier to feel ‘alive’ because I
didn’t understand the complexities of life. After all, the more
knowledge we gain, the more __________ we obtain to go
along with it. The world is simpler in the dark than in the
light of day.
