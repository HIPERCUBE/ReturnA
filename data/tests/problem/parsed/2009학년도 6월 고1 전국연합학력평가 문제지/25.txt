25. There is an agricultural operation just outside Curitiba that
looks like other farms in other areas. At this farm, the workers
are not experienced farmers. Instead, they are drug addicts and
alcoholics who volunteer to spend up to nine months in a
program called Verde Saude (Green Health). In the program,
they cultivate medicinal plants including chamomile and aloe
vera, and then process a variety of herbal teas, syrups, and
other products that are sold in health-food stores. In exchange
for their labor, the workers receive counseling, medical care,
job training, and a dose of healthy country living to get them
back on their feet. In addition to growing crops, this farm
actually helps the city to .
① reduce soil pollution ② solve social problems
③ keep its population ④ save natural resources
⑤ gain political support
