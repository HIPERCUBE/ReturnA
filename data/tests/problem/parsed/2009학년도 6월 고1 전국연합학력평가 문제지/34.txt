For many of us, our lives are so filled with responsibilities
that it’s almost impossible for us to sit still and do nothing―
even for a few minutes. A friend of mine said to me, “People
are no longer human beings. We should be called human
doings.” I’d like you to allow yourself to be bored and do
nothing. If you allow yourself to be bored, even for an hour,
and don’t fight it, the feelings of boredom will be replaced with
feelings of peace. And after a little practice, you won't feel
pressured to be doing something all the time.
