36. ‘snow eater’에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은? [1점]
A ‘snow eater’ is a special wind. It blows only at certain
places and times. One of these places is in the Rocky Mountains.
The special time is most often late winter or early spring. The
mountains are still covered with snow then. One day a wind
comes from the west. The wind blows up the west side of the
mountain. It drops rain there. So it gets drier and drier as it
climbs. Soon the wind reaches the top of the mountain. Cold air
there keeps it from going higher. Then the dry wind starts down
the other side of the mountain. As it travels down, a strange
thing happens. The wind becomes warmer and warmer. The
warm wind melts the snow at the foot of the mountain. This
wind may last only a few hours but sometimes lasts a few days.
