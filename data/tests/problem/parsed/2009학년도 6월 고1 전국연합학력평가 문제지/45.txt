If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon
and stars, we would go into darkness happily. Instead, we are
diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s
light. We’ve done a lot to the night : We’ve filled it with light.
Its benefits come with consequences called light pollution.
Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design,
which allows artificial light to shine outward and upward into
the sky, where it’s not wanted. Ill-designed lighting radically
changes light levels, and affects some aspects of life : migration,
reproduction, and feeding. For example, endangered leatherback
turtles are guided by the horizon’s natural glow, but light from
a nearby city can lead them to get lost and hit by cars.
