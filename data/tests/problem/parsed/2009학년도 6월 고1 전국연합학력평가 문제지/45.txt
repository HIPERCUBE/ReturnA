If humans were truly at home under the light of the moon
and stars, we would go into darkness happily. Instead, we are
diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun’s
light. We’ve done a lot to the night : We’ve filled it with light.
Its benefits come with consequences called light pollution.
Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design,
which allows artificial light to shine outward and upward into
the sky, where it’s not wanted. Ill-designed lighting radically
changes light levels, and affects some aspects of life : migration,
reproduction, and feeding. For example, endangered leatherback
turtles are guided by the horizon’s natural glow, but light from
a nearby city can lead them to get lost and hit by cars.

(A) I was wiping off my car, waiting for my wife in front
of her office, when I spotted a man approaching me. At
first glance, he looked like a bum. I hoped he would not
ask me for any money. He didn’t. But after a few
minutes he said, “That’s a very pretty car.”
(B) I gave him enough money to get a warm meal and
shelter for the day. I actually had expected nothing, but
he had known a great truth. Maybe a god looked down,
called an angel, dressed him like a bum, and then said,
“Go to that man cleaning the car. He needs help.” Don’t
we all?
(C) He answered in three simple but profound words.
“Don’t we all?” I was feeling high and important, more
than a beggar, until those three words hit me like a
shotgun blast. Maybe not for meals or shelters, but
still I needed help. No matter how much you have, you
will always need help. No matter how little you have,
you can always give help, even if it’s just praise.
(D) I said, “Thanks,” and continued wiping off my car.
He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected
begging never came. As the silence between us
widened, something inside me said, “Ask him if he
needs any help.” I was sure that he would say, “Yes,”
but I held true to the inner voice. “Do you need any
help?” I asked.

Many argue that knowledge gives you power. Nevertheless,
we sometimes wish that we were never informed about
something. Why do we feel this way? Do we really need
knowledge to be happy? As for me, it seems that knowing
more often leads to a life of worry and misery. If we never
knew that there were better ways of doing things, then we
wouldn’t feel such a need for them. Knowledge only brings a
want for more. For happiness, therefore, a sense of nothing
would be beneficial. In addition, it is often better to enjoy,
simply accepting the way things are, rather than knowing
how they work. Why do we need water? Why do we need
food? Isn’t it more relaxing just to know that, without them,
you wouldn’t exist?
I’m not saying that knowledge is not good or powerful, but
it just makes me consider whether or not we are truly better
off with it. When I was younger, I found that I was happier
most of the time and it was easier to feel ‘alive’ because I
didn’t understand the complexities of life. After all, the more
knowledge we gain, the more __________ we obtain to go
along with it. The world is simpler in the dark than in the
light of day.
