having to cope with higher incidents of poor weather as our
climate becomes more unpredictable. Birds, mammals and

every year. The unseasonal weather, however, has brought
some advantages. It led to a spectacular display of red, yellow
and orange autumn leaves. Poor weather in August was
beneficial for certain cabbage butterflies which prospered as
their enemies decreased in number.
