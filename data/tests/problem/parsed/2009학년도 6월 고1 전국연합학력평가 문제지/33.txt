33. Supermarkets in Japan are struggling to meet consumer
demand for bananas as a fad diet sweeps the country. The
popularity of the diet, which suggests a banana and a glass of
warm water every morning, has been fed by online social
networks, a best-selling book called Morning Banana Diet and
supportive comments of famous people. A leading banana
importing company reported that sales of the fruit are up 25%
from the same period since last year. Some nutrition experts
have been a little doubtful about the effectiveness of the
banana diet. However, the price of bananas is still rising and
the shelves are going empty.
