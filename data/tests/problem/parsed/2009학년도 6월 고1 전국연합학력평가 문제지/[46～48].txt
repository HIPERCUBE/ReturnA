(A) I was wiping off my car, waiting for my wife in front
of her office, when I spotted a man approaching me. At
first glance, he looked like a bum. I hoped he would not
ask me for any money. He didn’t. But after a few
minutes he said, “That’s a very pretty car.”
(B) I gave him enough money to get a warm meal and
shelter for the day. I actually had expected nothing, but
he had known a great truth. Maybe a god looked down,
called an angel, dressed him like a bum, and then said,
“Go to that man cleaning the car. He needs help.” Don’t
we all?
(C) He answered in three simple but profound words.
“Don’t we all?” I was feeling high and important, more
than a beggar, until those three words hit me like a
shotgun blast. Maybe not for meals or shelters, but
still I needed help. No matter how much you have, you
will always need help. No matter how little you have,
you can always give help, even if it’s just praise.
(D) I said, “Thanks,” and continued wiping off my car.
He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected
begging never came. As the silence between us
widened, something inside me said, “Ask him if he
needs any help.” I was sure that he would say, “Yes,”
but I held true to the inner voice. “Do you need any
help?” I asked.
