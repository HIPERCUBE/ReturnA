Many argue that knowledge gives you power. Nevertheless,
we sometimes wish that we were never informed about
something. Why do we feel this way? Do we really need
knowledge to be happy? As for me, it seems that knowing
more often leads to a life of worry and misery. If we never
knew that there were better ways of doing things, then we
wouldn’t feel such a need for them. Knowledge only brings a
want for more. For happiness, therefore, a sense of nothing
would be beneficial. In addition, it is often better to enjoy,
simply accepting the way things are, rather than knowing
how they work. Why do we need water? Why do we need
food? Isn’t it more relaxing just to know that, without them,
you wouldn’t exist?
I’m not saying that knowledge is not good or powerful, but
it just makes me consider whether or not we are truly better
off with it. When I was younger, I found that I was happier
most of the time and it was easier to feel ‘alive’ because I
didn’t understand the complexities of life. After all, the more
knowledge we gain, the more __________ we obtain to go
along with it. The world is simpler in the dark than in the
light of day.
