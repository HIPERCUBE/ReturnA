The unforgettable musical, Rent, has been performed 5,140
times since the show ① opened in 1996. It generated such
support that fans who saw the production many times came
② to be known as ‘Rent-heads.’ One of the numerous reasons
fans kept coming back ③ are that the characters in the show are
very realistic. Larson wrote Rent based on Puccini’s opera, La
Boheme. But its characters are quite different from ④ those in
the opera. ⑤Upon its opening on Broadway, this show brought
controversy, especially when it came to more conservative,
middle-aged audiences. But after receiving a glowing review
from the press, Rent became the hottest ticket in town.
