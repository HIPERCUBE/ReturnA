19. 밑줄 친 They [they]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Movies may seem to be just amusement and
entertainment, but to me, ① they are the best answer to the
loneliness and boredom of my life. In movies I meet
wonderful people and see places I would never be able to
see. ② They are a time machine, taking us back into the
past or even giving us a glimpse of the future. From
ancient Egypt to Star Wars, ③ they are a trip through
time. Another reason I like movies is that for a few hours
in the dark, I can feel that all people in the audience are on
my side. ④ They may be strangers, but we laugh and cry
together. Movies can be thrilling or joyous. ⑤ They take us
away from our sadness and problems.
