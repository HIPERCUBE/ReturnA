I fell in love with the minister’s son, Robert, the winter I
turned fourteen. When I found out that my parents had invited
the minister’s family over for Christmas Eve dinner, I didn’t
know what to do. What would Robert think of our humble
Christmas? What would he think of my noisy relatives who
lacked proper American manners? Finally, they all arrived ―
the minister’s family and all my relatives. Dinner threw me
deeper into despair. My relatives licked the ends of their
chopsticks, dipping them into the dozen or so dishes of food.
After dinner my father leaned back and belched loudly, which
astonished our guests.
