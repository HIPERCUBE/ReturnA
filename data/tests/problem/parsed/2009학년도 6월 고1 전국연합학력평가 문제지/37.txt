37. John Cann에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
In Australia, John Cann carries on his family’s tradition of
reptile shows. His parents started their snake circus in 1919.
Cann’s mother was called Cleopatra after the queen of Egypt
who was lethally bitten by a snake. Both parents survived
their profession and retired in good health. Their son has made
good use of his lifelong experience with snakes. He now
advises the Australia Museum on reptiles and his goal is not
only to entertain, but also to educate his audience on the value
of these reptiles and their important role in the environment.
