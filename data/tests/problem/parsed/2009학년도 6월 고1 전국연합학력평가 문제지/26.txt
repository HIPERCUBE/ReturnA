26. “Money can buy happiness, but only if ,”
reported a team of researchers at the University of British
Columbia. In their experiment, they asked more than 630
Americans to rate their general happiness. They were then
asked to report their annual income and detail their monthly
spending including bills, gifts for themselves, gifts for others
and donations to charity. As its result, it was found that
spending as little as $ 5 a day on others could significantly
boost happiness. “We wanted to test our theory to show that
how money is spent is as important as how much is earned,”
said Elizabeth Dunn, a psychologist from the university.
