40. Many species of fishes and birds travel in groups, such as 
schools of fishes and flocks of birds. These schools and 
flocks often move very quickly in a highly synchronized 
fashion. These groups provide protection for individuals in the 
group. Most predators have to single out and focus on a single 
individual, in order to successfully capture a prey. Fast‑moving 
and synchronized flocks and schools are believed to make it 
difficult for predators to accomplish this. In some cases, a 
group of prey is able to successfully fight off a predatory 
attack, whereas an individual prey probably would not be able 
to do this. Although a baboon on its own would probably 
submit to a predatory attack from a leopard, a group of males 
in a baboon troop can usually ward off such an attack.
