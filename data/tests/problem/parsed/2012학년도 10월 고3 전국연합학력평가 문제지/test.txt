I enjoyed your story very much. It seems that you are 
endowed with special talents. It is now your duty to develop 
them, because a person who wastes his inborn talents is a 
fool. Your story contains some grammatical and spelling errors 
commonly made by students your age. Yet you have written 
your story with an interesting style and a great plot. The 
most impressive thing about your story is that it has irony. 
You may not even know what that word means, but someday 
you will. It is something that some writers try to reach for 
their entire careers and never attain. You have achieved it 
with your first story. My door is and always will be open to 
you. I am ready to hear any story you have to tell.

One summer, I was traveling with a small group in Greece. 
Included in our group was an 85‑year‑old lady. I called her 
“Sweetie.” She was frail, tiny, and thin but ① she was such 
a brave traveler and didn’t want to miss a thing. So, 
although she was very tired, ② she insisted on going along 
to the Euripides Theater to see a Greek play. No sooner 
had the play begun than ③ she started to doze off, falling 
forward. There were no backs on these seats. Before I 
could help ④ her, a local Greek peasant woman reached 
forward and took hold of the tiny narrow shoulders of 
Sweetie. The woman slowly drew the tired body back until 
it leaned against ⑤ her knees. She provided support for 
Sweetie for the entire play.

Dropping your cell phone in water means you have to 
replace it, but sometimes if you’re fast enough, you might 
be able to save the phone! If you want to suck the liquid 
out of the inner parts of the phone, try ① using a vacuum 
cleaner. Remove all residual moisture by drawing it away, 
with a vacuum cleaner ② holding over the affected areas for 
up to twenty minutes. This way you can completely dry out 
your phone and get it ③ working in thirty minutes. However, 
unless the exposure to water was extremely short, it’s not 
recommended to attempt to turn your phone on ④ this soon. 
Be careful not to hold the vacuum too close to the phone, 
as a vacuum can create static electricity. It is even worse 
for the phone. The best way, of course, is ⑤ to bring your 
phone to the customer service center as soon as possible.

Albert Einstein talked about what influenced his life as a 
scientist. He remembered seeing a pocket compass when he 
was five years old and (A) marveling / marveled  that the 
needle always pointed north. In that moment, Einstein 
recalled, he “felt something deeply hidden behind things.” 
Around the age of six, Einstein began studying the violin. 
When after several years he recognized the mathematical 
structure of music, the violin became a lifelong friend of his. 
When Einstein was ten, his family enrolled him in the 
Luitpold Gymnasium, (B) there / where  he developed a 
suspicion of authority. The trait served Einstein well later in 
life as a scientist. His habit of skepticism made (C) him / it  
easy to question many long‑standing scientific assumptions.
(A)            (B)           (C)
① marveling there him
② marveled there him
③ marveling where him
④ marveled where it
⑤ marveling where it

22. Every student in your school gets 168 hours each week. 
Subtract the time kids spend on sleeping, eating, and 
associating with friends and family, and so on (about 84 
hours). That leaves each child with about 84 hours each week, 
or 4,368 hours each year. Out of that block, you as a teacher 
get at most 30 hours each week, or 1,260 hours each year for 
changing student lives. Then, you have 28 percent of a 
student’s waking time. The significance of that number, 28 
percent, is profound. With the small proportion of their lives 
that you do have access to, you cannot afford to waste a 
single class or school day. You cannot afford to bore a student 
or fail to engage her in class. School needs to be a nonstop 
bobsled run, full of activity, challenge, correction, support, and 
enrichment. You need to challenge students to do their best 
every hour of every day they are in your charge.

③ 학생들에게 한 약속은 반드시 지켜야 한다.

⑤ 학생들을 가르치는 모든 시간을 귀하게 여겨야 한다.
23. Nowadays money can buy more and more: political 
influence, good medical care, a home in a safe neighborhood 
rather than a crime‑ridden one, access to elite schools rather 
than failing ones, etc. Should we allow this tendency to go 
unchecked? Putting a price on the good things in life can 
corrupt them. That’s because markets don’t only allocate 
goods; they also express and promote certain attitudes toward 
the goods being exchanged. Paying kids to read books might 
get them to read more, but also teach them to regard reading 
as a chore rather than a source of intrinsic satisfaction. 
Auctioning seats in the incoming freshman class to the 
highest bidders might raise revenue but also erode the 
integrity of the college and the value of its diplomas. Hiring 
foreign soldiers to fight our wars might spare the lives of our 
citizens but corrupt the meaning of citizenship.

24. Reading seems to be an important activity that helps 
teenagers secure a good   . Some researchers 
from Oxford University studied 17,000 people all born in the 
same week in May, 1970. They are now grown up and in 
their early 40s and the sociological study has tracked their 
progress through time. At the age of 16, in 1986, they were 
asked which activities they did in their spare time for 
pleasure. These answers were then checked against what they 
were engaged in at the age of 33, in 2003. The researchers 
found that there was a 39 percent probability that girls would 
be in professional or managerial posts at 33 if they had read 
books at 16, but only a 25 percent chance if they had not. 
For boys the figures rose from 48 percent to 58 percent if 
they read books.
① job ② habit ③ attitude
④ education ⑤ relationship
25. Nowadays, travelers who want a visual record of their 
vacations pack a camera. But before 1900, when George 
Eastman first introduced the Brownie camera, travelers 
recorded their impressions of the places they visited in a 
notebook with ink, pencils, or watercolors. Think of Charles 
Darwin, who might not have come up with his theory of 
evolution if it had not been for the thousands of sketches he 
made of his trip to the Galápagos Islands. The advantage is 
that sketchbook travelers   . They are forced to 
look with different eyes. Let’s take the famous lone cypress 
tree overlooking Pebble Beach near Carmel, California, as an 
example. Today’s camera‑carrying tourists generally think, “Ooh, 
that’s pretty,” and proceed to snap a quick digital photo. But a 
travel sketcher would take the time to notice its trunk’s subtle 
shading, its lengthening shadow, the yelping Pekingese that just 
ran circles around it.          * Pekingese : 페키니즈(애완용 작은 개)
① develop fantastic drawing skills
② deeply see the places they visit 
③ travel faster than camera carriers
④ understand the theory of evolution
⑤ have more pictures of the scenery
26. In a study, researchers observed a small industrial 
community in Austria called Marienthal at a time when the 
entire community was out of work. They noted that before 
the economic depression, people in the community were 
active in leisure as well as work. They participated in 
political organizations, frequented the public library, and 
enjoyed organizing various social events. After the town 
factory closed and everyone was out of work, the citizens 
showed no concern. The citizens, cut off from their work, 
lost the material and moral incentives to make use of their 
time. Marienthal’s citizens not only lost their work, but they 
lost their   . Clearly, they had no free time 
because they had no constrained time. The researchers 
summed up the problem this way: “The trouble with 
unemployment is that you never get a day off.”
① interest in history
② ability to enjoy leisure
③ willingness to help others
④ means to get justice done
⑤ opportunities to learn more skills
27.     . Igor Stravinsky wrote the score 
for his ballet Apollo Musagetes in six parts for a string 
orchestra. The first time it was performed, there were 
sixteen first and fourteen second violins, ten violas, four first 
and four second cellos, and six double basses. Stravinsky was 
horrified: “I was struck by both the confusion of sound and 
the excessive resonance.... Everything seemed drowned in 
indistinct buzzing.” He pared the orchestra down to eight first 
and eight second violins, six violas, four first and four second 
cellos, and four double basses, and “everything became sharp 
and clear.” As Stravinsky found out the hard way, scaling is a 
major issue in orchestrating music.
①　Variety is the spice of life
②　Larger is not necessarily better
③　Music is recreated by the audience
④　Good music has to be listened to loud
⑤　Composers should do more than entertain audience
28. What’s interesting about animals being afraid is that  
. A fearful prey animal like a deer 
ought to just get out of there whenever it sees something 
strange and different that it doesn’t understand. But that’s not 
what happens. The more fearful the animal, the more likely 
he is to investigate. Indians used this principle to hunt 
antelope. They’d lie down on the ground holding a flag, and 
when the antelope came up to investigate they’d kill it. I’ve 
never heard of Indians lying down on the ground holding a 
flag to catch buffalo. I don’t think a buffalo is going to be as 
compelled to investigate a flag flying in the middle of the 
prairie. He’s a great big strong buffalo; what does he have to 
worry about? But a delicate little antelope has a lot to worry 
about, and that’s why he’s always looking into things.
① fear seems to be related with intelligence
② prior experience helps avoid danger later in life
③ their fear is directly connected to their survival
④ fear is the strongest drive to make them migrate
⑤ the most fearful animals are also the most curious

29. At a glance, corn appears to be more efficient than 
sugarcane as an energy crop. By processing 1 ton of corn, 
producers can make 100 gallons of ethanol, whereas 1 ton of 
sugarcane yields no more than 20 gallons. But sugarcane 
grows in more (A)  packed clumps than corn, so 1 acre 
of sugarcane can produce at least 590 gallons of ethanol, 
compared to 400 gallons of ethanol from 1 acre of corn. 
Converting sugarcane to ethanol is also more (B) . 
Distillers in Brazil, the world’s largest producer of ethanol, 
get 8 gallons of sugarcane ethanol burning just 1 gallon of 
fossil fuel. Corn, the primary source of ethanol in the United 
States (which is the world’s second‑largest ethanol producer), 
yields only 2 gallons of ethanol per gallon of fossil fuel.
(A)  (B)
① tightly eco‑friendly
② tightly time‑consuming
③ loosely time‑consuming
④ loosely eco‑friendly
⑤ loosely labor‑intensive
30. Your expectations are likely to influence your perceptions of 
people with whom you interact. Most people have a tendency 
to expect positive behaviors from people they like and respect, 
and negative behaviors from people they could easily live 
without. (A) , suppose that, as you are walking down the 
street, you come across someone you know. That individual, 
rather than smiling and greeting you, instead looks the other 
way and passes silently by. If this is a person you admire, you 
m  i g ht perceive the individual to be deep in thought and therefore not paying any attention to other pedestrians on the 
street. (B) , if you dislike the person, you might 
interpret the behavior as an inappropriate demonstration of 
arrogance and elitism. It is extremely difficult for you to 
perceive people objectively, particularly if you have 
expectations — based on your past experiences — about how 
those people are likely to be.
(A)             (B)
① For example On the other hand
② For example As a result
③ By contrast As a result
④ By contrast In other words
⑤ Nevertheless On the other hand

The graph above shows which book type is preferred in 
specific situations by the Americans who have read both 
printed books and e‑books in the past twelve months. ① Nine 
times more readers say they will choose printed books than 
e‑books when reading with a child. ② A large majority of 
readers also believe that printed books are better to share 
with other people than e‑books. ③ When it comes to reading 
books in bed, readers are somewhat evenly split on their 
preference with just a small difference of two percent. ④ Half 
the readers say e‑books are better while traveling or 
commuting, whereas just about one‑fifth prefer printed books. 
⑤ Over four‑fifths of these American readers prefer e‑books 
when they want to get a book quickly, while just a little 
more than one‑tenth pick printed books.

32. If you regularly respond to everyday tumbles like, “Whoops, 
you’re all right,” your toddler is pretty sure to feel all right. 
If you screech, “Oh, my poor baby! Are you hurt?” your 
toddler will learn to take the opportunity to answer “Yes” loud 
and clear. Nothing alarms a child more than a parent who is 
alarmed. So though it’s only natural for you to feel keenly 
your child’s pain, you shouldn’t show excessive concern. You’ll 
be a much more effective source of reassurance if you remain 
calm . Toddlers whose parents don’t overreact become 
children who pick themselves up from a fall, brush themselves 
off, and go on their merry way.
① teaching compassion and sympathy to toddlers
② positive effects of parents not overreacting
③ advantages of learning to express pain
④ signals shown by alarmed toddlers
⑤ types of danger that toddlers face
33. Although shopping can be fun for many consumers, it often 
requires effort, which is cost to be subtracted from the 
benefits associated with buying a product. The greater the 
perceived cost of shopping in terms of effort, time, and 
expense, the fewer will buy, even if the price and the product 
are “right.” On the other hand, the easier it is to buy a 
product, the less the cost, and the more will buy. Thus, in 
promoting a product, extensive distribution is required to 
reach as many consumers as possible. Restricted geographical 
distribution means that the product is bought by fewer and 
probably less often. Most products cannot depend on 
customers undertaking long journeys or extensive search. The 
product must be available where and when needed.
① new products reflecting consumers’ needs
② the role of distribution in creating purchase
③ the correlation between sales and advertising
④ evaluating customers’ attitude toward a product
⑤ breaking down trade barriers in the global market

“The economist in me says the best gift is cash,” writes 
Alex Tabarrok, an economist and blogger. “The rest of me 
(A) assists / resists . ” He offers a good counterexample to 
the practical notion that the ideal gift is an item we would 
have bought for ourselves: Suppose someone gives you $100, 
and you buy a set of tires for your car. This is what 
maximizes your (B) originality / utility . Still, you might not 
be very happy if your lover gave you car tires for your 
birthday. In most cases, Tabarrok points out, we wish the gift 
giver would buy us something less (C) luxurious / ordinary  . 
From our intimates at least, we’d rather receive a gift that 
speaks to “the wild self, the passionate self, the romantic self.”
(A) (B) (C) 
① assists originality luxurious
② assists utility ordinary
③ resists utility ordinary
④ resists originality luxurious
⑤ resists utility luxurious

In 1909, Herbert Cecil Booth happened to be inside the 
Empire Music Hall when his interest was captured by a 
demonstration of a cleaning machine. The machine certainly 
stirred up dust, but it ultimately proved ①ineffective in 
collecting and removing it. Booth asked the man demonstrating 
the machine whether suction rather than pressure wouldn’t work 
better. He indignantly replied that suction had been ② tried on 
numerous occasions but didn’t work. Booth’s mind quickly 
went to work on the problem. Several days later while 
discussing his thoughts on the subject with friends, he 
attempted to ③ illustrate his idea by unfolding his 
handkerchief, placing it on the velvet seat of his chair, placing 
his lips upon the handkerchief, and ④ exhaling. Booth’s friends 
were surprised at the ⑤ quantity of dust he had managed to 
draw out from the chair. Booth patented his new invention 
that same year.
36. Knut에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Knut, a polar bear, was born at the Berlin Zoo to 
20‑year‑old Tosca, a former circus performer from East 
Germany who was born in Canada. When Knut and his 
unnamed brother were born, Tosca rejected her cubs for 
unknown reasons, abandoning them on a rock in the polar bear 
enclosure. Zookeepers rescued the cubs, but Knut’s brother 
died of an infection four days later. Knut spent the first 44 
days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper Thomas 
Dörflein began raising the cub. Knut’s need for round‑the‑clock 
care required that Dörflein not only sleep on a mattress next 
to Knut’s sleeping crate at night, but also play with, bathe, 
and feed the cub daily. Dörflein also accompanied Knut on his 
twice‑daily one‑hour shows for the public and therefore 
appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub.

37. Mordecai Brown에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
There was an amazing pitcher whose name was Mordecai 
Brown. He was born in Nyesville, Indiana, in 1876. From the 
time he arrived in the big leagues with St. Louis, he was 
known as Three Finger Brown. Mordecai only had three 
fingers on his right hand, his pitching hand. That was the 
result of a farming accident when he was a youngster. But 
Mordecai gripped the ball the only way he could with his 
thumb and two remaining fingers. The result was a strange 
hop on the ball, one he probably couldn’t have achieved if his 
hand had not been injured. He played with five major league 
baseball clubs, and was famous for his exceptional curveball, 
which broke radically before reaching the plate. Mordecai 
Brown was eventually elected to baseball’s Hall of Fame in 
1949, one year after he died.

38. 다음 글에서 Victor가 겪은 심경의 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Victor, a private detective, leaned against his window and 
looked out. ‘Surely no other place on earth is more proud of 
its beauty than Venice,’ he thought watching its spires and 
domes. Whistling a tune, Victor walked over to his large 
mirror. Just the weather for trying out his new disguise, he 
thought, as the sun warmed the back of his sturdy neck. He 
had bought this new treasure only the previous day: an 
enormous mustache, so dark and bushy that it would have 
made any self‑respecting walrus extremely jealous. He stuck it 
carefully under his nose and stood on his toes to make himself 
taller. He became so fascinated by his reflection that he only 
heard the footsteps on the stairs when they stopped outside 
his door. ‘Clients. Blast! Why are they bothering me now of 
all times?’ With a deep sigh he sat behind his desk. He heard 
voices whispering outside his door.         * walrus : 바다코끼리
① cheerful → annoyed ② satisfied → regretful
③ jealous → humble ④ nervous → thankful
⑤ confident → ashamed

39. An ombudsman noticed a pattern in the newspaper’s 
reporting on shipwrecks: Each such story featured a cat that 
had survived. When she asked the reporter about this curious 
coincidence, she was told: “One of those wrecked ships had a 
cat, and the crew went back to save it. I made the cat a 
feature of my story, while the other reporters failed to 
mention the cat, and were called down by their editors for 
being beaten. The next time there was a shipwreck, there 
was no cat but the other ship news reporters did not wish to 
take a chance, and put the cat in. I wrote the report, leaving 
out the cat, and then I was severely scolded for being beaten. 
Now when there is a shipwreck all of us always put in the 
cat.”

40. Many species of fishes and birds travel in groups, such as 
schools of fishes and flocks of birds. These schools and 
flocks often move very quickly in a highly synchronized 
fashion. These groups provide protection for individuals in the 
group. Most predators have to single out and focus on a single 
individual, in order to successfully capture a prey. Fast‑moving 
and synchronized flocks and schools are believed to make it 
difficult for predators to accomplish this. In some cases, a 
group of prey is able to successfully fight off a predatory 
attack, whereas an individual prey probably would not be able 
to do this. Although a baboon on its own would probably 
submit to a predatory attack from a leopard, a group of males 
in a baboon troop can usually ward off such an attack.

② Advantages of Hunting in Groups
③ Food Chain in the Animal Kingdom

There is an increasing body of evidence that shows that the 
time of day that we take medicine makes a difference to how 
successful the treatment will be. ① Asthma sufferers, for 
example, are several hundred times more likely to have an 
attack at night than during the day. ② Symptoms of hay fever 
are worse in the morning than at night. ③ Doctors, however, 
are still taught to prescribe equal doses of medication across 
the course of the day. ④ Success in treatment is to some 
degree dependent on the cooperation between the patient and 
the doctor. ⑤ Physicians working in the field of the 
interactions of biologic rhythms with medications are calling 
for medical training to include education on the daily rhythms 
of illness and research into time–specific treatments.

But the most powerful computer on the planet can’t 
drive a truck.
You can appreciate the power of your visual system by 
comparing human abilities to those of computers. ( ① ) When 
it comes to math, science, and other traditional “thinking” 
tasks, machines beat people ― no contest. ( ② ) Five dollars 
will get you a calculator that can perform simple calculations 
faster and more accurately than any human can. ( ③ ) With 
fifty dollars you can buy chess software that can defeat more 
than 99 percent of the world’s population. ( ④ ) That’s 
because computers can’t see, especially not in complex, 
ever‑changing environments like the one you face every time 
you drive. ( ⑤ ) Tasks that you take for granted ― for 
example, walking on a rocky shore where footing is uncertain
― are much more difficult than playing top‑level chess.

43. When you have hope, you can absorb and accept bad 
news, responding and reacting it positively and 
creatively. Here is a good illustration.
(A) The next week he countered with his own ad. It read: 
“We’ve been in business only one week — all of our 
merchandise is brand‑new!” And he was off to a great 
start. 
(B) A young man decided he would open a new store. When 
he was ready for the grand opening, a merchant down the 
street got nervous about this man taking some of his 
business away, so he ran an ad in the local paper. 
(C) It read: “Do your local shopping here. We have been in 
business for 50 years!” The young man couldn’t believe it. 
How could he handle this competition?

44. Napoleon Bonaparte demanded a secret communication 
system because he wanted something to enable his 
soldiers to converse silently and even in the dark.
(A) In the new system, any letter could be composed of six 
dots (1 to 3 in a column on the left, and 4 to 6 on the 
right) with a space between each letter. The letter M, for 
example, is composed of three raised dots, 1‑3‑4. The 
invention of Braille revolutionized communication for 
millions. 
(B) So Barbier took his idea to the National Institute for the 
Blind in Paris. There, he met Louis Braille, who was 
blind. Braille fixed Barbier’s system, modifying it so that 
the finger didn’t have to travel to read a symbol. 
(C) In response to the request, Charles Barbier developed a 
code of raised dots on paper that spelled out words. The 
military rejected it, however, because it was too hard to 
learn.

In an experiment, Solomon Asch gave participants 
six‑word descriptions of target people — the words were 
intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, and 
envious. He then asked the participants to generate a 
broader description of those people on the basis of the 
six words. But for one group of participants he presented 
the positive words first; for the other, he reversed the 
offer. For both groups, the words were exactly the same. 
Yet Asch found striking differences in how the 
participants characterized the target person, depending on 
whether the first words they encountered were positive 
or negative. For example, the participants who were 
given the positive words first responded like “He is a 
forceful person, has his own convictions, and is usually 
right about things,” but those who heard the negative 
words first responded like “This individual is probably 
maladjusted because he is envious and impulsive.”

This experiment showed that one’s (A) of other 
people might be altered by the (B) of the words 
presented to describe them.

(A)
It was a beautiful day for sightseeing around downtown 
Portland. We were a bunch of counselors on our day off, 
away from the campers, just out for some fun. The 
weather was perfect for a picnic, so when lunch time came, 
we headed for a small park. Since we all had different 
cravings, we decided to split up, get what each of us 
wanted, and meet back on the grass in a few minutes.
(B)
That’s when Rob said, “I’ll be right back. Please wait for 
me a minute,” and ran off. I watched curiously as (a) he 
went across to the hot dog stand. Then I realized what he 
was doing. He bought a hot dog, crossed back to the trash 
can, and gave the hungry man the food. When he came 
back to us, Rob said simply, “I was just passing on the 
kindness that someone gave to (b) me.” That day I learned 
how generosity can go farther than the person you give to. 
By giving, you teach others how to give also.
(C)
We finished eating and decided to head off for more 
sightseeing. But when Rob and I went to the garbage can to 
throw away my lunch bag, I heard a strong voice ask, 
“There isn’t any food in that bag, is there?” It was (c) the 
man who had been watching us. I didn’t know what to say. 
“No, I ate it already.” “Oh,” was his only answer, with no 
shame in his voice at all. He was obviously hungry, couldn’t 
bear to see anything thrown away, and was used to asking 
this question. I felt bad for the man, but I didn’t know what 
I could do.
(D)
When (d) my friend Rob headed for a hot dog stand, I 
decided to keep his company. We watched the vendor put 
together the perfect hot dog, just the way Rob wanted it. 
But when Rob took out money to pay him, the man 
surprised us. “It looks a little on the cool side,” he said, 
“so you don’t have to pay me. This will be my freebie of 
the day.” (e) He said thanks, and then we joined our 
friends in the park. But as we talked and ate, I was 
distracted by a man sitting alone nearby, looking at us. I 
could tell that he hadn’t showered for days. Another 
homeless person, I thought, like all the others you see in 
cities. I didn’t pay much more attention than that.

Goldcorp was a small gold‑mining firm, based in Toronto. 
Facing higher costs of production, accumulating debt, and few 
prospects of finding new gold deposits, the company was on 
the brink of bankruptcy when its CEO, Robert McEwen, got a 
radical idea. He would take all of the company’s geological 
data on its Red Lake property, put it up on the Web, and 
ask the world to tell the company             . The 
company offered $575,000 in prize money. Over one 
thousand cyberspace prospectors from fifty countries began 
analyzing the data. Geologists weighed in, as did 
mathematicians, military personnel, and graduate students 
from diverse fields.
What was so interesting was the range of expertise from 
so many different disciplines including advanced physics, 
applied math, and intelligent systems. The results were 
startling. “There were capabilities I had never seen before in 
the industry,” noted McEwen. “When I saw the computer 
graphics I almost fell out of my chair.” The contestants had 
pinpointed 110 locations on the company’s property, half of 
which had never been earmarked by company geologists. 
Amazingly, more than eighty percent of the new targets 
yielded large amounts of gold — more than eight million 
ounces.
