(A)
It was a beautiful day for sightseeing around downtown 
Portland. We were a bunch of counselors on our day off, 
away from the campers, just out for some fun. The 
weather was perfect for a picnic, so when lunch time came, 
we headed for a small park. Since we all had different 
cravings, we decided to split up, get what each of us 
wanted, and meet back on the grass in a few minutes.
(B)
That’s when Rob said, “I’ll be right back. Please wait for 
me a minute,” and ran off. I watched curiously as (a) he 
went across to the hot dog stand. Then I realized what he 
was doing. He bought a hot dog, crossed back to the trash 
can, and gave the hungry man the food. When he came 
back to us, Rob said simply, “I was just passing on the 
kindness that someone gave to (b) me.” That day I learned 
how generosity can go farther than the person you give to. 
By giving, you teach others how to give also.
(C)
We finished eating and decided to head off for more 
sightseeing. But when Rob and I went to the garbage can to 
throw away my lunch bag, I heard a strong voice ask, 
“There isn’t any food in that bag, is there?” It was (c) the 
man who had been watching us. I didn’t know what to say. 
“No, I ate it already.” “Oh,” was his only answer, with no 
shame in his voice at all. He was obviously hungry, couldn’t 
bear to see anything thrown away, and was used to asking 
this question. I felt bad for the man, but I didn’t know what 
I could do.
(D)
When (d) my friend Rob headed for a hot dog stand, I 
decided to keep his company. We watched the vendor put 
together the perfect hot dog, just the way Rob wanted it. 
But when Rob took out money to pay him, the man 
surprised us. “It looks a little on the cool side,” he said, 
“so you don’t have to pay me. This will be my freebie of 
the day.” (e) He said thanks, and then we joined our 
friends in the park. But as we talked and ate, I was 
distracted by a man sitting alone nearby, looking at us. I 
could tell that he hadn’t showered for days. Another 
homeless person, I thought, like all the others you see in 
cities. I didn’t pay much more attention than that.
