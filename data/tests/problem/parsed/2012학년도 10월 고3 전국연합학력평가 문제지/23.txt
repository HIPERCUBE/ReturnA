23. Nowadays money can buy more and more: political 
influence, good medical care, a home in a safe neighborhood 
rather than a crime‑ridden one, access to elite schools rather 
than failing ones, etc. Should we allow this tendency to go 
unchecked? Putting a price on the good things in life can 
corrupt them. That’s because markets don’t only allocate 
goods; they also express and promote certain attitudes toward 
the goods being exchanged. Paying kids to read books might 
get them to read more, but also teach them to regard reading 
as a chore rather than a source of intrinsic satisfaction. 
Auctioning seats in the incoming freshman class to the 
highest bidders might raise revenue but also erode the 
integrity of the college and the value of its diplomas. Hiring 
foreign soldiers to fight our wars might spare the lives of our 
citizens but corrupt the meaning of citizenship.
