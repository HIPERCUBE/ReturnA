44. Napoleon Bonaparte demanded a secret communication 
system because he wanted something to enable his 
soldiers to converse silently and even in the dark.
(A) In the new system, any letter could be composed of six 
dots (1 to 3 in a column on the left, and 4 to 6 on the 
right) with a space between each letter. The letter M, for 
example, is composed of three raised dots, 1‑3‑4. The 
invention of Braille revolutionized communication for 
millions. 
(B) So Barbier took his idea to the National Institute for the 
Blind in Paris. There, he met Louis Braille, who was 
blind. Braille fixed Barbier’s system, modifying it so that 
the finger didn’t have to travel to read a symbol. 
(C) In response to the request, Charles Barbier developed a 
code of raised dots on paper that spelled out words. The 
military rejected it, however, because it was too hard to 
learn.
