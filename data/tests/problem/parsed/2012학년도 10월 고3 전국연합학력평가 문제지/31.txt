The graph above shows which book type is preferred in 
specific situations by the Americans who have read both 
printed books and e‑books in the past twelve months. ① Nine 
times more readers say they will choose printed books than 
e‑books when reading with a child. ② A large majority of 
readers also believe that printed books are better to share 
with other people than e‑books. ③ When it comes to reading 
books in bed, readers are somewhat evenly split on their 
preference with just a small difference of two percent. ④ Half 
the readers say e‑books are better while traveling or 
commuting, whereas just about one‑fifth prefer printed books. 
⑤ Over four‑fifths of these American readers prefer e‑books 
when they want to get a book quickly, while just a little 
more than one‑tenth pick printed books.
