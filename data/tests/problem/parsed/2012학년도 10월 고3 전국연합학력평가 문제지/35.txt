In 1909, Herbert Cecil Booth happened to be inside the 
Empire Music Hall when his interest was captured by a 
demonstration of a cleaning machine. The machine certainly 
stirred up dust, but it ultimately proved ①ineffective in 
collecting and removing it. Booth asked the man demonstrating 
the machine whether suction rather than pressure wouldn’t work 
better. He indignantly replied that suction had been ② tried on 
numerous occasions but didn’t work. Booth’s mind quickly 
went to work on the problem. Several days later while 
discussing his thoughts on the subject with friends, he 
attempted to ③ illustrate his idea by unfolding his 
handkerchief, placing it on the velvet seat of his chair, placing 
his lips upon the handkerchief, and ④ exhaling. Booth’s friends 
were surprised at the ⑤ quantity of dust he had managed to 
draw out from the chair. Booth patented his new invention 
that same year.
