39. An ombudsman noticed a pattern in the newspaper’s 
reporting on shipwrecks: Each such story featured a cat that 
had survived. When she asked the reporter about this curious 
coincidence, she was told: “One of those wrecked ships had a 
cat, and the crew went back to save it. I made the cat a 
feature of my story, while the other reporters failed to 
mention the cat, and were called down by their editors for 
being beaten. The next time there was a shipwreck, there 
was no cat but the other ship news reporters did not wish to 
take a chance, and put the cat in. I wrote the report, leaving 
out the cat, and then I was severely scolded for being beaten. 
Now when there is a shipwreck all of us always put in the 
cat.”
