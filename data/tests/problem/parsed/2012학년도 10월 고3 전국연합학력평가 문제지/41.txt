There is an increasing body of evidence that shows that the 
time of day that we take medicine makes a difference to how 
successful the treatment will be. ① Asthma sufferers, for 
example, are several hundred times more likely to have an 
attack at night than during the day. ② Symptoms of hay fever 
are worse in the morning than at night. ③ Doctors, however, 
are still taught to prescribe equal doses of medication across 
the course of the day. ④ Success in treatment is to some 
degree dependent on the cooperation between the patient and 
the doctor. ⑤ Physicians working in the field of the 
interactions of biologic rhythms with medications are calling 
for medical training to include education on the daily rhythms 
of illness and research into time–specific treatments.
