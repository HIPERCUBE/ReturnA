36. Knut에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Knut, a polar bear, was born at the Berlin Zoo to 
20‑year‑old Tosca, a former circus performer from East 
Germany who was born in Canada. When Knut and his 
unnamed brother were born, Tosca rejected her cubs for 
unknown reasons, abandoning them on a rock in the polar bear 
enclosure. Zookeepers rescued the cubs, but Knut’s brother 
died of an infection four days later. Knut spent the first 44 
days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper Thomas 
Dörflein began raising the cub. Knut’s need for round‑the‑clock 
care required that Dörflein not only sleep on a mattress next 
to Knut’s sleeping crate at night, but also play with, bathe, 
and feed the cub daily. Dörflein also accompanied Knut on his 
twice‑daily one‑hour shows for the public and therefore 
appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub.
