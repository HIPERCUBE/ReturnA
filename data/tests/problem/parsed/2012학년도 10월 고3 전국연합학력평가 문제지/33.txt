33. Although shopping can be fun for many consumers, it often 
requires effort, which is cost to be subtracted from the 
benefits associated with buying a product. The greater the 
perceived cost of shopping in terms of effort, time, and 
expense, the fewer will buy, even if the price and the product 
are “right.” On the other hand, the easier it is to buy a 
product, the less the cost, and the more will buy. Thus, in 
promoting a product, extensive distribution is required to 
reach as many consumers as possible. Restricted geographical 
distribution means that the product is bought by fewer and 
probably less often. Most products cannot depend on 
customers undertaking long journeys or extensive search. The 
product must be available where and when needed.
