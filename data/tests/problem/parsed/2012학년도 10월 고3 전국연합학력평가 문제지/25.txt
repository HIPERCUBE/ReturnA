25. Nowadays, travelers who want a visual record of their 
vacations pack a camera. But before 1900, when George 
Eastman first introduced the Brownie camera, travelers 
recorded their impressions of the places they visited in a 
notebook with ink, pencils, or watercolors. Think of Charles 
Darwin, who might not have come up with his theory of 
evolution if it had not been for the thousands of sketches he 
made of his trip to the Galápagos Islands. The advantage is 
that sketchbook travelers   . They are forced to 
look with different eyes. Let’s take the famous lone cypress 
tree overlooking Pebble Beach near Carmel, California, as an 
example. Today’s camera‑carrying tourists generally think, “Ooh, 
that’s pretty,” and proceed to snap a quick digital photo. But a 
travel sketcher would take the time to notice its trunk’s subtle 
shading, its lengthening shadow, the yelping Pekingese that just 
ran circles around it.          * Pekingese : 페키니즈(애완용 작은 개)
