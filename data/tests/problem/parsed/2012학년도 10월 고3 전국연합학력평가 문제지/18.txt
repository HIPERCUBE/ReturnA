I enjoyed your story very much. It seems that you are 
endowed with special talents. It is now your duty to develop 
them, because a person who wastes his inborn talents is a 
fool. Your story contains some grammatical and spelling errors 
commonly made by students your age. Yet you have written 
your story with an interesting style and a great plot. The 
most impressive thing about your story is that it has irony. 
You may not even know what that word means, but someday 
you will. It is something that some writers try to reach for 
their entire careers and never attain. You have achieved it 
with your first story. My door is and always will be open to 
you. I am ready to hear any story you have to tell.
