Dropping your cell phone in water means you have to 
replace it, but sometimes if you’re fast enough, you might 
be able to save the phone! If you want to suck the liquid 
out of the inner parts of the phone, try ① using a vacuum 
cleaner. Remove all residual moisture by drawing it away, 
with a vacuum cleaner ② holding over the affected areas for 
up to twenty minutes. This way you can completely dry out 
your phone and get it ③ working in thirty minutes. However, 
unless the exposure to water was extremely short, it’s not 
recommended to attempt to turn your phone on ④ this soon. 
Be careful not to hold the vacuum too close to the phone, 
as a vacuum can create static electricity. It is even worse 
for the phone. The best way, of course, is ⑤ to bring your 
phone to the customer service center as soon as possible.
