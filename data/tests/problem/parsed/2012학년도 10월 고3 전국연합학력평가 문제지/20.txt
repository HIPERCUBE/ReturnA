Dropping your cell phone in water means you have to 
replace it, but sometimes if you’re fast enough, you might 
be able to save the phone! If you want to suck the liquid 
out of the inner parts of the phone, try ① using a vacuum 
cleaner. Remove all residual moisture by drawing it away, 
with a vacuum cleaner ② holding over the affected areas for 
up to twenty minutes. This way you can completely dry out 
your phone and get it ③ working in thirty minutes. However, 
unless the exposure to water was extremely short, it’s not 
recommended to attempt to turn your phone on ④ this soon. 
Be careful not to hold the vacuum too close to the phone, 
as a vacuum can create static electricity. It is even worse 
for the phone. The best way, of course, is ⑤ to bring your 
phone to the customer service center as soon as possible.

The graph above shows which book type is preferred in 
specific situations by the Americans who have read both 
printed books and e‑books in the past twelve months. ① Nine 
times more readers say they will choose printed books than 
e‑books when reading with a child. ② A large majority of 
readers also believe that printed books are better to share 
with other people than e‑books. ③ When it comes to reading 
books in bed, readers are somewhat evenly split on their 
preference with just a small difference of two percent. ④ Half 
the readers say e‑books are better while traveling or 
commuting, whereas just about one‑fifth prefer printed books. 
⑤ Over four‑fifths of these American readers prefer e‑books 
when they want to get a book quickly, while just a little 
more than one‑tenth pick printed books.
32. If you regularly respond to everyday tumbles like, “Whoops, 
you’re all right,” your toddler is pretty sure to feel all right. 
If you screech, “Oh, my poor baby! Are you hurt?” your 
toddler will learn to take the opportunity to answer “Yes” loud 
and clear. Nothing alarms a child more than a parent who is 
alarmed. So though it’s only natural for you to feel keenly 
your child’s pain, you shouldn’t show excessive concern. You’ll 
be a much more effective source of reassurance if you remain 
calm . Toddlers whose parents don’t overreact become 
children who pick themselves up from a fall, brush themselves 
off, and go on their merry way.
① teaching compassion and sympathy to toddlers
② positive effects of parents not overreacting
③ advantages of learning to express pain
④ signals shown by alarmed toddlers
⑤ types of danger that toddlers face
33. Although shopping can be fun for many consumers, it often 
requires effort, which is cost to be subtracted from the 
benefits associated with buying a product. The greater the 
perceived cost of shopping in terms of effort, time, and 
expense, the fewer will buy, even if the price and the product 
are “right.” On the other hand, the easier it is to buy a 
product, the less the cost, and the more will buy. Thus, in 
promoting a product, extensive distribution is required to 
reach as many consumers as possible. Restricted geographical 
distribution means that the product is bought by fewer and 
probably less often. Most products cannot depend on 
customers undertaking long journeys or extensive search. The 
product must be available where and when needed.
① new products reflecting consumers’ needs
② the role of distribution in creating purchase
③ the correlation between sales and advertising
④ evaluating customers’ attitude toward a product
⑤ breaking down trade barriers in the global market

maximizes your (B) originality / utility . Still, you might not 
be very happy if your lover gave you car tires for your

From our intimates at least, we’d rather receive a gift that 
speaks to “the wild self, the passionate self, the romantic self.”

In 1909, Herbert Cecil Booth happened to be inside the 
Empire Music Hall when his interest was captured by a 
demonstration of a cleaning machine. The machine certainly 
stirred up dust, but it ultimately proved ①ineffective in 
collecting and removing it. Booth asked the man demonstrating 
the machine whether suction rather than pressure wouldn’t work 
better. He indignantly replied that suction had been ② tried on 
numerous occasions but didn’t work. Booth’s mind quickly 
went to work on the problem. Several days later while 
discussing his thoughts on the subject with friends, he 
attempted to ③ illustrate his idea by unfolding his 
handkerchief, placing it on the velvet seat of his chair, placing 
his lips upon the handkerchief, and ④ exhaling. Booth’s friends 
were surprised at the ⑤ quantity of dust he had managed to 
draw out from the chair. Booth patented his new invention 
that same year.
36. Knut에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Knut, a polar bear, was born at the Berlin Zoo to 
20‑year‑old Tosca, a former circus performer from East 
Germany who was born in Canada. When Knut and his 
unnamed brother were born, Tosca rejected her cubs for 
unknown reasons, abandoning them on a rock in the polar bear 
enclosure. Zookeepers rescued the cubs, but Knut’s brother 
died of an infection four days later. Knut spent the first 44 
days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper Thomas 
Dörflein began raising the cub. Knut’s need for round‑the‑clock 
care required that Dörflein not only sleep on a mattress next 
to Knut’s sleeping crate at night, but also play with, bathe, 
and feed the cub daily. Dörflein also accompanied Knut on his 
twice‑daily one‑hour shows for the public and therefore 
appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub.

37. Mordecai Brown에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
There was an amazing pitcher whose name was Mordecai 
Brown. He was born in Nyesville, Indiana, in 1876. From the 
time he arrived in the big leagues with St. Louis, he was 
known as Three Finger Brown. Mordecai only had three 
fingers on his right hand, his pitching hand. That was the 
result of a farming accident when he was a youngster. But 
Mordecai gripped the ball the only way he could with his 
thumb and two remaining fingers. The result was a strange 
hop on the ball, one he probably couldn’t have achieved if his 
hand had not been injured. He played with five major league 
baseball clubs, and was famous for his exceptional curveball, 
which broke radically before reaching the plate. Mordecai 
Brown was eventually elected to baseball’s Hall of Fame in 
1949, one year after he died.

Victor, a private detective, leaned against his window and 
looked out. ‘Surely no other place on earth is more proud of 
its beauty than Venice,’ he thought watching its spires and 
domes. Whistling a tune, Victor walked over to his large 
mirror. Just the weather for trying out his new disguise, he 
thought, as the sun warmed the back of his sturdy neck. He 
had bought this new treasure only the previous day: an 
enormous mustache, so dark and bushy that it would have 
made any self‑respecting walrus extremely jealous. He stuck it 
carefully under his nose and stood on his toes to make himself 
taller. He became so fascinated by his reflection that he only 
heard the footsteps on the stairs when they stopped outside 
his door. ‘Clients. Blast! Why are they bothering me now of 
all times?’ With a deep sigh he sat behind his desk. He heard 
voices whispering outside his door.         * walrus : 바다코끼리
① cheerful → annoyed ② satisfied → regretful
③ jealous → humble ④ nervous → thankful
⑤ confident → ashamed
39. An ombudsman noticed a pattern in the newspaper’s 
reporting on shipwrecks: Each such story featured a cat that 
had survived. When she asked the reporter about this curious 
coincidence, she was told: “One of those wrecked ships had a 
cat, and the crew went back to save it. I made the cat a 
feature of my story, while the other reporters failed to 
mention the cat, and were called down by their editors for 
being beaten. The next time there was a shipwreck, there 
was no cat but the other ship news reporters did not wish to 
take a chance, and put the cat in. I wrote the report, leaving 
out the cat, and then I was severely scolded for being beaten. 
Now when there is a shipwreck all of us always put in the 
cat.”

40. Many species of fishes and birds travel in groups, such as 
schools of fishes and flocks of birds. These schools and 
flocks often move very quickly in a highly synchronized 
fashion. These groups provide protection for individuals in the 
group. Most predators have to single out and focus on a single 
individual, in order to successfully capture a prey. Fast‑moving 
and synchronized flocks and schools are believed to make it 
difficult for predators to accomplish this. In some cases, a 
group of prey is able to successfully fight off a predatory 
attack, whereas an individual prey probably would not be able 
to do this. Although a baboon on its own would probably 
submit to a predatory attack from a leopard, a group of males 
in a baboon troop can usually ward off such an attack.

There is an increasing body of evidence that shows that the 
time of day that we take medicine makes a difference to how 
successful the treatment will be. ① Asthma sufferers, for 
example, are several hundred times more likely to have an 
attack at night than during the day. ② Symptoms of hay fever 
are worse in the morning than at night. ③ Doctors, however, 
are still taught to prescribe equal doses of medication across 
the course of the day. ④ Success in treatment is to some 
degree dependent on the cooperation between the patient and 
the doctor. ⑤ Physicians working in the field of the 
interactions of biologic rhythms with medications are calling 
for medical training to include education on the daily rhythms 
of illness and research into time–specific treatments.

But the most powerful computer on the planet can’t 
drive a truck.
You can appreciate the power of your visual system by 
comparing human abilities to those of computers. ( ① ) When 
it comes to math, science, and other traditional “thinking” 
tasks, machines beat people ― no contest. ( ② ) Five dollars 
will get you a calculator that can perform simple calculations 
faster and more accurately than any human can. ( ③ ) With 
fifty dollars you can buy chess software that can defeat more 
than 99 percent of the world’s population. ( ④ ) That’s 
because computers can’t see, especially not in complex, 
ever‑changing environments like the one you face every time 
you drive. ( ⑤ ) Tasks that you take for granted ― for 
example, walking on a rocky shore where footing is uncertain
― are much more difficult than playing top‑level chess.

(A) The next week he countered with his own ad. It read: 
“We’ve been in business only one week — all of our 
merchandise is brand‑new!” And he was off to a great 
start. 
(B) A young man decided he would open a new store. When 
he was ready for the grand opening, a merchant down the 
street got nervous about this man taking some of his 
business away, so he ran an ad in the local paper. 
(C) It read: “Do your local shopping here. We have been in 
business for 50 years!” The young man couldn’t believe it.

44. Napoleon Bonaparte demanded a secret communication 
system because he wanted something to enable his 
soldiers to converse silently and even in the dark.
(A) In the new system, any letter could be composed of six 
dots (1 to 3 in a column on the left, and 4 to 6 on the 
right) with a space between each letter. The letter M, for 
example, is composed of three raised dots, 1‑3‑4. The 
invention of Braille revolutionized communication for 
millions. 
(B) So Barbier took his idea to the National Institute for the 
Blind in Paris. There, he met Louis Braille, who was 
blind. Braille fixed Barbier’s system, modifying it so that 
the finger didn’t have to travel to read a symbol. 
(C) In response to the request, Charles Barbier developed a 
code of raised dots on paper that spelled out words. The 
military rejected it, however, because it was too hard to 
learn.

In an experiment, Solomon Asch gave participants 
six‑word descriptions of target people — the words were 
intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, and 
envious. He then asked the participants to generate a 
broader description of those people on the basis of the 
six words. But for one group of participants he presented 
the positive words first; for the other, he reversed the 
offer. For both groups, the words were exactly the same. 
Yet Asch found striking differences in how the 
participants characterized the target person, depending on 
whether the first words they encountered were positive 
or negative. For example, the participants who were 
given the positive words first responded like “He is a 
forceful person, has his own convictions, and is usually 
right about things,” but those who heard the negative 
words first responded like “This individual is probably 
maladjusted because he is envious and impulsive.”
