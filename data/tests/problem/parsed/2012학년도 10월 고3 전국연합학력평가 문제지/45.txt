In an experiment, Solomon Asch gave participants 
six‑word descriptions of target people — the words were 
intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, and 
envious. He then asked the participants to generate a 
broader description of those people on the basis of the 
six words. But for one group of participants he presented 
the positive words first; for the other, he reversed the 
offer. For both groups, the words were exactly the same. 
Yet Asch found striking differences in how the 
participants characterized the target person, depending on 
whether the first words they encountered were positive 
or negative. For example, the participants who were 
given the positive words first responded like “He is a 
forceful person, has his own convictions, and is usually 
right about things,” but those who heard the negative 
words first responded like “This individual is probably 
maladjusted because he is envious and impulsive.”

(A)
It was a beautiful day for sightseeing around downtown 
Portland. We were a bunch of counselors on our day off, 
away from the campers, just out for some fun. The 
weather was perfect for a picnic, so when lunch time came, 
we headed for a small park. Since we all had different 
cravings, we decided to split up, get what each of us 
wanted, and meet back on the grass in a few minutes.
(B)
That’s when Rob said, “I’ll be right back. Please wait for 
me a minute,” and ran off. I watched curiously as (a) he 
went across to the hot dog stand. Then I realized what he 
was doing. He bought a hot dog, crossed back to the trash 
can, and gave the hungry man the food. When he came 
back to us, Rob said simply, “I was just passing on the 
kindness that someone gave to (b) me.” That day I learned 
how generosity can go farther than the person you give to. 
By giving, you teach others how to give also.
(C)
We finished eating and decided to head off for more 
sightseeing. But when Rob and I went to the garbage can to 
throw away my lunch bag, I heard a strong voice ask, 
“There isn’t any food in that bag, is there?” It was (c) the 
man who had been watching us. I didn’t know what to say. 
“No, I ate it already.” “Oh,” was his only answer, with no 
shame in his voice at all. He was obviously hungry, couldn’t 
bear to see anything thrown away, and was used to asking 
this question. I felt bad for the man, but I didn’t know what 
I could do.
(D)
When (d) my friend Rob headed for a hot dog stand, I 
decided to keep his company. We watched the vendor put 
together the perfect hot dog, just the way Rob wanted it. 
But when Rob took out money to pay him, the man 
surprised us. “It looks a little on the cool side,” he said, 
“so you don’t have to pay me. This will be my freebie of 
the day.” (e) He said thanks, and then we joined our 
friends in the park. But as we talked and ate, I was 
distracted by a man sitting alone nearby, looking at us. I 
could tell that he hadn’t showered for days. Another 
homeless person, I thought, like all the others you see in 
cities. I didn’t pay much more attention than that.

Goldcorp was a small gold‑mining firm, based in Toronto. 
Facing higher costs of production, accumulating debt, and few 
prospects of finding new gold deposits, the company was on 
the brink of bankruptcy when its CEO, Robert McEwen, got a 
radical idea. He would take all of the company’s geological 
data on its Red Lake property, put it up on the Web, and 
ask the world to tell the company             . The 
company offered $575,000 in prize money. Over one 
thousand cyberspace prospectors from fifty countries began 
analyzing the data. Geologists weighed in, as did 
mathematicians, military personnel, and graduate students 
from diverse fields.
What was so interesting was the range of expertise from 
so many different disciplines including advanced physics, 
applied math, and intelligent systems. The results were 
startling. “There were capabilities I had never seen before in 
the industry,” noted McEwen. “When I saw the computer 
graphics I almost fell out of my chair.” The contestants had 
pinpointed 110 locations on the company’s property, half of 
which had never been earmarked by company geologists. 
Amazingly, more than eighty percent of the new targets 
yielded large amounts of gold — more than eight million 
ounces.
