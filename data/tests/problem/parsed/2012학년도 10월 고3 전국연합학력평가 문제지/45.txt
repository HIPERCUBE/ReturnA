In an experiment, Solomon Asch gave participants 
six‑word descriptions of target people — the words were 
intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, and 
envious. He then asked the participants to generate a 
broader description of those people on the basis of the 
six words. But for one group of participants he presented 
the positive words first; for the other, he reversed the 
offer. For both groups, the words were exactly the same. 
Yet Asch found striking differences in how the 
participants characterized the target person, depending on 
whether the first words they encountered were positive 
or negative. For example, the participants who were 
given the positive words first responded like “He is a 
forceful person, has his own convictions, and is usually 
right about things,” but those who heard the negative 
words first responded like “This individual is probably 
maladjusted because he is envious and impulsive.”
