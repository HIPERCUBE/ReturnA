32. If you regularly respond to everyday tumbles like, “Whoops, 
you’re all right,” your toddler is pretty sure to feel all right. 
If you screech, “Oh, my poor baby! Are you hurt?” your 
toddler will learn to take the opportunity to answer “Yes” loud 
and clear. Nothing alarms a child more than a parent who is 
alarmed. So though it’s only natural for you to feel keenly 
your child’s pain, you shouldn’t show excessive concern. You’ll 
be a much more effective source of reassurance if you remain 
calm . Toddlers whose parents don’t overreact become 
children who pick themselves up from a fall, brush themselves 
off, and go on their merry way.
