29. At a glance, corn appears to be more efficient than 
sugarcane as an energy crop. By processing 1 ton of corn, 
producers can make 100 gallons of ethanol, whereas 1 ton of 
sugarcane yields no more than 20 gallons. But sugarcane 
grows in more (A)  packed clumps than corn, so 1 acre 
of sugarcane can produce at least 590 gallons of ethanol, 
compared to 400 gallons of ethanol from 1 acre of corn. 
Converting sugarcane to ethanol is also more (B) . 
Distillers in Brazil, the world’s largest producer of ethanol, 
get 8 gallons of sugarcane ethanol burning just 1 gallon of 
fossil fuel. Corn, the primary source of ethanol in the United 
States (which is the world’s second‑largest ethanol producer), 
yields only 2 gallons of ethanol per gallon of fossil fuel.
