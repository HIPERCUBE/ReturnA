But the most powerful computer on the planet can’t 
drive a truck.
You can appreciate the power of your visual system by 
comparing human abilities to those of computers. ( ① ) When 
it comes to math, science, and other traditional “thinking” 
tasks, machines beat people ― no contest. ( ② ) Five dollars 
will get you a calculator that can perform simple calculations 
faster and more accurately than any human can. ( ③ ) With 
fifty dollars you can buy chess software that can defeat more 
than 99 percent of the world’s population. ( ④ ) That’s 
because computers can’t see, especially not in complex, 
ever‑changing environments like the one you face every time 
you drive. ( ⑤ ) Tasks that you take for granted ― for 
example, walking on a rocky shore where footing is uncertain
― are much more difficult than playing top‑level chess.
