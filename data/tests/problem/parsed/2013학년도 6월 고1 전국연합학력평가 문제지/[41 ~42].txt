People want their problems solved. Questions like
“What’s the problem?” and “What are we going to do
about this?” are important. But whether they say it or
not, people often need some acknowledgment of feelings
before they can move on to the conversation for
problem­solving.
Too often in difficult conversations, we skip right to
problem­solving without acknowledging our partners’
feelings. “You’re working too hard,” says your wife.
“When was the last time we had dinner together?” You
realize she’s right, and say, “Well, for the next month,
my workload is a lot lighter. I’ll make an effort to be
home every night by six o’clock.” Your wife doesn’t
seem satisfied, and you are left wondering what more
you could have said.
But your wife’s complaint is not a math problem. You
may think you’ve “solved” the problem, but her invisible
questions haven’t been answered. Problem­solving is
important, but it has to wait; matters. Your
wife wants her feelings acknowledged first. Saying “It’s
been a tough time, these last few months, hasn’t it?” or
“It sounds like you’re feeling lonely” would be more
appropriate.
