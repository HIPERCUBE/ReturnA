Dear Ms. White,
My son, Michael, got home from school yesterday
around 6 p.m. after the basketball match, with four
homework assignments. By 11 p.m., he had completed
only three: science, math and English. He worked
hard all evening. When he was about to start your
homework, I decided to stop him. He looked
exhausted, so I made him pack up his books and go
to bed. I promised him that I would write to you and
explain the situation.
Michael is anxious to finish your homework. Would
it be possible to allow him to do it over the weekend
and hand it in next Monday? We would be very
grateful if you could agree to this.
Yours sincerely,
Dorothy Williams

24. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
“Annie, what a great picture you’ve made! What is it?”
What’s wrong with this reaction to a child’s drawing? You’re
obviously interested, and it sounds encouraging to your ears.
But this kind of praise can actually have the opposite effect.
Generalized praise like “great picture” isn’t as meaningful to
children as finding something specific about their performance
or behavior. “I like the bright colors you used in your
picture” is more effective than “great picture.” If you say,
“That’s nice, dear,” without looking at what your child is
trying to show you, it could affect her self­esteem. Specific
praise gives her confidence in your interest and lets her
know you really care.

② 아이에게 행동으로 모범을 보이라.

⑤ 아이의 감추어진 재능을 조기에 발견하라.
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
If you’re too busy to do laundry, don’t worry about it. At
least your jeans will stay clean, depending on your definition
of “clean.” After wearing a pair of unwashed jeans for fifteen
months, Josh Le, a student at the University of Alberta,
handed them to Dr. McQueen, a textile scientist. She sampled
the bacteria living on the jeans. Next, Le washed the jeans.
He wore the jeans for only two weeks this time and Dr.
McQueen took a sample again. The results? Whether fifteen
months or two weeks, the bacteria growth was about the
same. Now what about the smell? Le did air out his jeans
three times a week and he reportedly still had lots of
friends. * air out: (옷에) 바람을 쐬다
① Doing Laundry Is Bad for the Environment
② Is Doing Laundry Necessary That Often?
③ Are Bacteria the Cause of Bad Smell?
④ Unwashed Jeans: Home For Bacteria
⑤ New Jeans: A Must for Teens
26. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Peter thought King Edward was different from fairy tale
kings. ① He was a real human being, a man with a serious,
kind face. Peter had seen ②him often when he was
younger. Each morning, the king had come from the palace
on his horse, and ridden alone through the streets, greeting
his people. Sometimes, when Peter was a little boy, his
older brother, Henry, had taken ③him to stand on the
sidewalk so that he could wave to the king. Sometimes ④he
had waved back to the two of them, and smiled. “Now you
are special forever,” Henry had told Peter, “because you
have been greeted by ⑤ him.”

적절한 것은? [3점]
When I was a young girl, my room was always a mess.
My mother was always trying to get me to straighten it up,
telling me, “Go clean your room!” I resisted her at every
opportunity. I hated to (A) tell / be told what to do. I was
determined to have my room the way I wanted it.
(B) Because /Whether I actually liked living in a messy
room or not was another subject altogether. I never stopped
to think about the benefits of having a clean room. To me,
it was more important to get my own way. And my mother,
(C) alike / like most other parents, did not get me to realize
the benefits for myself. Instead, she decided on lecturing.
　(A) (B) (C)
① tell Because alike
② tell Whether like
③ be told Because alike
④ be told Because like
⑤ be told Whether like
28. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적
절한 것은?
In most situations, social proof is very useful. The
restaurant with the fullest parking lot usually does have
the best food. You will make (A) fewer / more mistakes in
life by paying attention to what others are doing than by
neglecting them. For example, when you are driving down
the expressway and all the cars in front of you start
changing lanes, those drivers probably know something you
don’t know and you should change lanes, too. If you
(B) follow / ignore the drivers, you may hit something in
the road and be in a serious car accident. But sometimes
people create social proof for a bad purpose. You should
be careful about this kind of social proof, because it is
used to (C) benefit / mislead you.
　(A) (B) (C)
① fewer follow benefit
② fewer ignore mislead
③ fewer ignore benefit
④ more follow mislead
⑤ more ignore benefit


33. Who would have thought, 20 years ago, that a box made
out of plastic and glass would ruin the manners of millions
of people? We know about the digital miracles brought by
the smartphone. But one of its biggest influences on our
lives is the sudden breaking of standards of etiquette in less
than a decade. These days, many smartphone owners check
Twitter during a conversation and do not consider it
impolite. This usually takes place while
someone else is talking: a friend, colleague or boss. Younger
smartphone users even have learned the art of texting one
person while they themselves are talking to another. [3점]
① online learning
② digital rudeness
③ physical contact
④ creative thinking
⑤　emotional growth
34. Some scientists believe that certain animals use a type of
language. For example, vervet monkeys have different sounds
for different predators. When an alarm call is given, the
monkeys know what predators― eagles, leopards or snakes―
are approaching. However, the monkeys aren’t born knowing
the meaning of each of these sounds. Young monkeys learn
the meaning of the sounds from listening to and watching
older monkeys. This learning takes some time. After young
monkeys learn the alarm call for seeing an eagle, they use it
whenever they see a large bird, even if the bird is harmless.
Only after much trial and error do they realize that the eagle
call . [3점]
* predator: 포식 동물
① must be used only for eagles
② can send many different messages
③ is needed when an eagle is in danger
④ actually consists of meaningless sounds
⑤ can be used to imitate the sound of eagles
35. When we design experiments, we usually .
For example, let’s say a farmer wants to know what kind of
plowing method is better. The farmer chooses two fields and
then changes only one thing between them. He changes how
he plows his fields. Everything else will be the same on both
fields: the type of crop he grows, the amount of water that
he uses and the slope of the fields he plants on. The fields
should be facing the same direction to get about the same
amount of sunlight. If the farmer only changes how he plows
his fields, he can see the impact of the one change. After
the experiment is complete, the farmer can conclude which
plowing method is better. * plow: 쟁기질하다, 경작하다
① choose just one thing to change
② collect as much data as possible
③ work together with other scientists
④ repeat the same experiments many times
⑤ study other people’s research on the topic
36. In most cases sound reaches the ear through the air; but
air is not the only medium through which sound is carried.
When we make a loud noise, it will frighten fish and cause
them to swim away. So we conclude that the sound must
have reached them through the water. An Indian puts his ear
to the ground in order to detect distant footsteps. Such
sounds are comparatively clear when they are carried
through the earth. Similarly, a gentle tapping at one end of a
long table can be clearly heard at the opposite end if the
ear is pressed against the table. From these facts, we can
see that . [3점]
① hearing can be more effective than seeing
② people have various ranges of hearing ability
③ all living things communicate with each other
④ the speed of sound is slower than the speed of light
⑤ sound can be carried to the ear by various materials
37. 다음 글의 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
Sometimes I see the wrong use of “John and I” and “John
and me.” To figure out which one is correct, take out “John”
and see whether “I” or “me” sounds right. (A) ,
you would not say “John and me went to the store,” because
if you remove “John,” the sentence would be “me went to
the store.” So “John and I went to the store” is correct.
(B) , you would not say “Kate gave two apples to
John and I,” because if you remove “John,” the sentence
would be “Kate gave two apples to I.” So “Kate gave two
apples to John and me” is correct.
　 (A) (B)
① For example However
② For example Similarly
③ In addition However
④ In addition Similarly
⑤ Therefore In short

Cushions make the sofa more comfortable. Creating a
cushion from your old T­shirts or sweaters is a fun
project.
(A) On the fabric of your choice, draw a shape of the
cushion you want to make. Square shapes may be the
easier route to go for beginners. Cut out two separate
squares along the line.
(B) Pick your fabric. Sweaters are soft and comfortable.
T­shirts are a fun idea as well, because you can draw
pictures on them. Whichever fabric you choose, make
sure that you are okay with cutting it.
(C) After that, face them backwards to each other. Sew
three sides together. Turn it inside out, and fill it with
cotton. Finish sewing the open side. Now, you have a
cushion made out of your clothes.

곳은?
For example, Anika, an Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin,
started to imitate Tommy, a fur seal in the same tank.
Dolphins love to imitate. ( ① ) Often an untrained dolphin
in an aquarium watches another dolphin go through its act
and then does the act perfectly without training. ( ② ) But
dolphins don’t limit themselves to imitating each other. ( ③ )
Unlike a dolphin, she lay on her side, imitating Tommy’s
sleeping position. ( ④ ) As Tommy did, she also lay belly­up
on the surface of the water. ( ⑤ ) This put her blowhole
underwater, so from time to time she had to turn over to
breathe. * blowhole: (고래의) 숨구멍

On a Sunday evening some years ago, we were driving
from New York City to Princeton, as we had been doing
every week for a long time. We saw an unusual sight: a
car on fire by the side of the road. When we reached
the same spot of the road the following Sunday, another
car was burning there. But this time, we found that we
were less surprised on the second occasion than we had
been on the first. This was now “the place where cars
catch fire.” Because the same kind of accident occurred
again, we were quite prepared to see it.
The (A) of the same kind of accident (B)
the surprise of watching it.

[41 ~42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
People want their problems solved. Questions like
“What’s the problem?” and “What are we going to do
about this?” are important. But whether they say it or
not, people often need some acknowledgment of feelings
before they can move on to the conversation for
problem­solving.
Too often in difficult conversations, we skip right to
problem­solving without acknowledging our partners’
feelings. “You’re working too hard,” says your wife.
“When was the last time we had dinner together?” You
realize she’s right, and say, “Well, for the next month,
my workload is a lot lighter. I’ll make an effort to be
home every night by six o’clock.” Your wife doesn’t
seem satisfied, and you are left wondering what more
you could have said.
But your wife’s complaint is not a math problem. You
may think you’ve “solved” the problem, but her invisible
questions haven’t been answered. Problem­solving is
important, but it has to wait; matters. Your
wife wants her feelings acknowledged first. Saying “It’s
been a tough time, these last few months, hasn’t it?” or
“It sounds like you’re feeling lonely” would be more
appropriate.

② Silence Can Be the Best Solution

[43 ~45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
While attending my 16­year­old son’s high school track
meet, I noticed a boy and he was the only one running
in regular sneakers. So I asked my son about it later on
and he told me that (a) the kid couldn’t afford “spikes.”
* track meet: 육상 경기 대회
(B)
The next day my son approached his teammate. He
told the boy that his aunt had bought (b) him a pair of
spikes that were the wrong size for him. My son asked
him for his shoe size and he said it was size eleven. My
son said the spikes happened to be the same size and
that the boy could have them if he wanted them.
(C)
I’m a single mom and I can’t afford sports equipment
at times. But my son and I are very fortunate to have
some relatives that help us out. It was obvious that my
son’s teammate needed help. So, my son and I came up
with a plan that would allow us to help (c) the kid
without embarrassing him.
(D)
Surprised, (d) the boy asked my son what he wanted
for the spikes, and told him that he didn’t have enough
money to pay for them. My son told (e) him not to
worry about it. He finally accepted my son’s favor. My
son and I felt really good about helping him and it was a
great lesson in kindness.
