35. When we design experiments, we usually .
For example, let’s say a farmer wants to know what kind of
plowing method is better. The farmer chooses two fields and
then changes only one thing between them. He changes how
he plows his fields. Everything else will be the same on both
fields: the type of crop he grows, the amount of water that
he uses and the slope of the fields he plants on. The fields
should be facing the same direction to get about the same
amount of sunlight. If the farmer only changes how he plows
his fields, he can see the impact of the one change. After
the experiment is complete, the farmer can conclude which
plowing method is better. * plow: 쟁기질하다, 경작하다
① choose just one thing to change
② collect as much data as possible
③ work together with other scientists
④ repeat the same experiments many times
⑤ study other people’s research on the topic
