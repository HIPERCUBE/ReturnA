(A)
While attending my 16­year­old son’s high school track
meet, I noticed a boy and he was the only one running
in regular sneakers. So I asked my son about it later on
and he told me that (a) the kid couldn’t afford “spikes.”
* track meet: 육상 경기 대회
(B)
The next day my son approached his teammate. He
told the boy that his aunt had bought (b) him a pair of
spikes that were the wrong size for him. My son asked
him for his shoe size and he said it was size eleven. My
son said the spikes happened to be the same size and
that the boy could have them if he wanted them.
(C)
I’m a single mom and I can’t afford sports equipment
at times. But my son and I are very fortunate to have
some relatives that help us out. It was obvious that my
son’s teammate needed help. So, my son and I came up
with a plan that would allow us to help (c) the kid
without embarrassing him.
(D)
Surprised, (d) the boy asked my son what he wanted
for the spikes, and told him that he didn’t have enough
money to pay for them. My son told (e) him not to
worry about it. He finally accepted my son’s favor. My
son and I felt really good about helping him and it was a
great lesson in kindness.
