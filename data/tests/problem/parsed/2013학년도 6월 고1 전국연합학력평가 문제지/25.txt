If you’re too busy to do laundry, don’t worry about it. At
least your jeans will stay clean, depending on your definition
of “clean.” After wearing a pair of unwashed jeans for fifteen
months, Josh Le, a student at the University of Alberta,
handed them to Dr. McQueen, a textile scientist. She sampled
the bacteria living on the jeans. Next, Le washed the jeans.
He wore the jeans for only two weeks this time and Dr.
McQueen took a sample again. The results? Whether fifteen
months or two weeks, the bacteria growth was about the
same. Now what about the smell? Le did air out his jeans
three times a week and he reportedly still had lots of
friends. * air out: (옷에) 바람을 쐬다
