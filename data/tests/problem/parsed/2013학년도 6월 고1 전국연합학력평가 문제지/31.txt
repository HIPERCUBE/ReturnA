It wasn’t until after 9 a.m. that an airplane started to run
down the runway toward the ocean for takeoff. The airport
was just a mile from the beautiful white sand beach. The
plane was only in the air for a few seconds before there
was a loud bang. Flames came out from one of the engines.
The people in the control tower heard the pilot say, “I’m

The plane went off the radar screen in the control tower.
When the police arrived at the scene, more than half of the
plane had already sunk into the ocean.
