“Annie, what a great picture you’ve made! What is it?”
What’s wrong with this reaction to a child’s drawing? You’re
obviously interested, and it sounds encouraging to your ears.
But this kind of praise can actually have the opposite effect.
Generalized praise like “great picture” isn’t as meaningful to
children as finding something specific about their performance
or behavior. “I like the bright colors you used in your
picture” is more effective than “great picture.” If you say,
“That’s nice, dear,” without looking at what your child is
trying to show you, it could affect her self­esteem. Specific
praise gives her confidence in your interest and lets her
know you really care.
