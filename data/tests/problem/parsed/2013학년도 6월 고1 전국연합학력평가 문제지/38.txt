Cushions make the sofa more comfortable. Creating a
cushion from your old T­shirts or sweaters is a fun
project.
(A) On the fabric of your choice, draw a shape of the
cushion you want to make. Square shapes may be the
easier route to go for beginners. Cut out two separate
squares along the line.
(B) Pick your fabric. Sweaters are soft and comfortable.
T­shirts are a fun idea as well, because you can draw
pictures on them. Whichever fabric you choose, make
sure that you are okay with cutting it.
(C) After that, face them backwards to each other. Sew
three sides together. Turn it inside out, and fill it with
cotton. Finish sewing the open side. Now, you have a
cushion made out of your clothes.
