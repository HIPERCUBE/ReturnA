Dear Ms. White,
My son, Michael, got home from school yesterday
around 6 p.m. after the basketball match, with four
homework assignments. By 11 p.m., he had completed
only three: science, math and English. He worked
hard all evening. When he was about to start your
homework, I decided to stop him. He looked
exhausted, so I made him pack up his books and go
to bed. I promised him that I would write to you and
explain the situation.
Michael is anxious to finish your homework. Would
it be possible to allow him to do it over the weekend
and hand it in next Monday? We would be very
grateful if you could agree to this.
Yours sincerely,
Dorothy Williams
