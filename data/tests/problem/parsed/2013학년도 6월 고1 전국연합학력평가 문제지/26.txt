Peter thought King Edward was different from fairy tale
kings. ① He was a real human being, a man with a serious,
kind face. Peter had seen ②him often when he was
younger. Each morning, the king had come from the palace
on his horse, and ridden alone through the streets, greeting
his people. Sometimes, when Peter was a little boy, his
older brother, Henry, had taken ③him to stand on the
sidewalk so that he could wave to the king. Sometimes ④he
had waved back to the two of them, and smiled. “Now you
are special forever,” Henry had told Peter, “because you
have been greeted by ⑤ him.”
