On my first day in the Emergency Center, I was about to 
drink my coffee when the first call came. I quickly picked up 
the line, “9-1-1.” My voice was trembling and my heart was 
racing. A woman cried, “My husband’s not breathing!” I 
instructed her to begin CPR. I was trying to be as steady as I 
could, but I was shaking. The situation was absolutely critical. 
While she was performing CPR, I immediately notified the 
nearby hospital. After a few tense moments, she came back on 
the line and shouted, “Where’s the ambulance?” I replied, 
“It’s getting there as quickly as it can.”
