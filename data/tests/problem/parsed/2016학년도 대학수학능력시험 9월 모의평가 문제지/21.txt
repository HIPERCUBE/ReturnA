There is strong research evidence that children perform 
better in mathematics if music is incorporated in it. It has been 
shown that mathematics is related with music in various 
known ways so much that not putting the relationship to good 
use in and out of school could only be to our disadvantage. 
Researchers at a Los Angeles school found that 136 second 
year elementary school pupils who learned to play the piano 
and read music improved their numeracy skills. This could be 
so since learning music emphasizes thinking in space and 
time, and when pupils learn rhythm, they are learning ratios, 
fractions and proportions. Other researchers investigated the 
ways in which first and third grade teachers could integrate 
music into their regular math classrooms. They concluded that 
music-math integrated lessons had positive effects on three 
mathematical ability areas of modeling, problem solving and 
application.
