Scientific experiments should be designed to show that your 
hypothesis is wrong and should be conducted completely 
objectively with no possible subjective influence on the 
outcome. ① Unfortunately few, if any, scientists are truly 
objective as they have often decided long before the 
experiment is begun what they would like the result to be. 
② This means that very often bias is (unintentionally) 
introduced into the experiment, the experimental procedure or 
the interpretation of results. ③ It is all too easy to justify to 
yourself why an experiment which does not fit with your 
expectations should be ignored, and why one which provides 
the results you ‘hoped for’ is the right one. ④ It is important 
to draw a meaningful result from the experiment on peer 
group activities. ⑤ This can be partly avoided by conducting 
experiments ‘blinded’ and by asking others to check your data 
or repeat experiments.
