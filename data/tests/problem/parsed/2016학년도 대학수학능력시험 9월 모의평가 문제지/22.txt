Do you have the emotional state of mind to become a leader? 
People pay close attention to a leader’s subtle expressions of 
emotion through body language and facial expression. Some 
emotions such as enthusiasm can quickly become contagious. 
Others, such as depression or discouragement, can drag down 
the entire organization. Leaders with positive emotional states 
of mind are like human magnets. People naturally gravitate to 
them and want to follow them. Such leaders inspire enthusiasm 
in their organizations and attract the best people to work for 
them. Conversely, leaders who emit negative emotional states 
of mind, who are irritable and bossy, repel people and have few 
followers.
* contagious: 전염성의, 전파하는
** repel: 쫓아버리다
