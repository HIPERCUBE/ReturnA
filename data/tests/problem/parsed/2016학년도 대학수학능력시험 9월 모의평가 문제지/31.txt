31. Early human societies were nomadic, based on hunting and 
gathering, and, in a shifting pattern of life in search of new 
sources of food, qualities such as lightness, portability, and 
adaptability were dominant criteria. With the evolution of more 
settled rural societies based on agriculture, other characteristics, 
other traditions of form appropriate to the new patterns of life, 
rapidly emerged. It must be emphasized, however, that tradition 
was not static, but constantly subject to minute variations 
appropriate to people and their circumstances. Although 
traditional forms reflected the experience of social groups, 
specific manifestations could be adapted in various minute and 
subtle ways to suit individual users’ needs. A chair could keep 
its basic, accepted characteristics while still being closely 
shaped in detail to the physique and proportions of a specific 
person. This basic principle of  allowed a 
constant stream of incremental modifications to be introduced, 
which, if demonstrated by experience to be advantageous, could 
be integrated back into the mainstream of tradition. [3점]
