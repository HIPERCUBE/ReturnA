Still, many believe we will eventually reach a point at 
which conflict with the finite nature of resources is 
inevitable.
Can we sustain our standard of living in the same ecological 
space while consuming the resources of that space? This 
question is particularly relevant since we are living in an era 
of skyrocketing fuel costs and humans’ ever-growing carbon 
footprints. ( ① ) Some argue that we are already at a 
breaking point because we have nearly exhausted the Earth’s 
finite carrying capacity. ( ② ) However, it’s possible that 
innovations and cultural changes can expand Earth’s capacity. 
( ③ ) We are already seeing this as the world economies are 
increasingly looking at “green,” renewable industries like 
solar and hydrogen energy. ( ④ ) That means survival could 
ultimately depend on getting the human population below its 
carrying capacity. ( ⑤ ) Otherwise, without population 
control, the demand for resources will eventually exceed an 
ecosystem’s ability to provide it. [3점]
