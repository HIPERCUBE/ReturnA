28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
The Internet and communication technologies play an 
ever-increasing role in the social lives of young people in 
developed societies. Adolescents have been quick to immerse 
themselves in technology with most ① using the Internet to 
communicate. Young people treat the mobile phone as an 
essential necessity of life and often prefer to use text messages 
to communicate with their friends. Young people also 
② increasingly access social networking websites. As 
technology and the Internet are a familiar resource for young 
people, it is logical ③ what they would seek assistance from 
this source. This has been shown by the increase in websites 
that provide therapeutic information for young people. A 
number of ‘youth friendly’ mental health websites ④ have 
been developed. The information ⑤ presented often takes the 
form of Frequently Asked Questions, fact sheets and suggested 
links. It would seem, therefore, logical to provide online 
counselling for young people.
