According to one traditional definition, aesthetics is the 
branch of philosophy that deals with beauty, especially 
beauty in the arts. Examining the pleasing features of the 
Mona Lisa or a snow-capped mountain, for example, 
would come under aesthetics.
(A) Consider Picasso’s Guernica, a huge (11-ft. × 25.6-ft.) 
painting in black, white, and grey that he made in 
response to the slaughter of Spanish civilians by German 
and Italian warplanes during the Spanish Civil War. 
Images of a cruel war dominate the canvas.
(B) That definition seems too narrow, however, since works of 
art and natural objects may interest us in other ways than by 
being beautiful. Instead of evoking admiration of beauty, 
artists may evoke puzzlement, shock, and even disgust. 
(C) This work is widely admired but not for being beautiful. 
So a better definition of aesthetics would be that it is the 
branch of philosophy that deals with the ways things 
please people in being experienced.
