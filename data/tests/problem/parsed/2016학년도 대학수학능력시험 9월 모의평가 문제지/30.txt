Dad just laughed and walked out of the room still holding 
Slade in his arms. He had dressed him and now he put ① him 
in his chair. As Slade sat in his chair eating a biscuit that Dad 
had spread with butter and homemade strawberry jam, Mom 
walked into the kitchen. She took one look at her little boy and 
started laughing; ② his little face and hands were covered with 
biscuit and jam. She thought how really cute he was. “Honey, 
what have you done? Look at him. I will never get ③ him 
clean again. I guess when he gets through eating you can take 
④ him out and dump him in the bathtub.” Dad laughed. Slade 
giggled and tried to spit biscuit all over Dad. It didn’t hit 
⑤ him because luckily he avoided the spray. That made Mom 
laugh even more and soon the little cabin was full of love and 
laughter.
