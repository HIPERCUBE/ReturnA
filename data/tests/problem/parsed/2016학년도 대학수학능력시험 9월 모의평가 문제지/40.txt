Certain species are more crucial to the maintenance of 
their ecosystem than others. Such species, called keystone 
species, are vital in determining the nature and structure of 
the entire ecosystem. The fact that other species depend on 
or are greatly affected by the keystone species is revealed 
when the keystone species is removed. It is in this sense 
that we should draw attention to fig trees. Different species 
of fig trees may be keystone species in tropical rain 
forests. Although figs collectively produce a continuous 
crop of fruits, fruit-eating monkeys, birds, bats, and other 
vertebrates of the forest do not normally consume large 
quantities of figs in their diets. During the time of year 
when other fruits are less plentiful, however, fig trees 
become important in sustaining fruit-eating vertebrates. 
Should the fig trees disappear, most of the fruit-eating 
vertebrates would be eliminated. Protecting fig trees in 
such tropical rainforest ecosystems is an important 
conservation goal because it increases the likelihood that 
monkeys, birds, bats, and other vertebrates will survive.
