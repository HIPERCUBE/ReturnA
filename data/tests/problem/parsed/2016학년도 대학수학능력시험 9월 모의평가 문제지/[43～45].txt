(A)
Peter Anderson was exhausted when he finally opened the 
front door of his apartment. He teaches first graders, which 
means he lives in a world of riddles, birthday cakes, and 
pointless stories. (a) His world is dominated by 6-year-olds. 
Throwing himself with his leather bag on the long, 
comfortable sofa, he closed his eyes and reviewed the events 
of the day. 
(B)
It was held in a seminar room where Anderson met the 
principal for the first time three years ago. The principal 
asked why he chose to work with young children. (b) He 
answered that he loved helping children learn to write their 
names for the first time, finding someone a new friend, and 
sharing in the joy of reading. But, as time passed, his 
commitment and passion seemed to fade gradually. He 
recalled his strong conviction during the interview.
(C)
That’s why Anderson took the job in the first place even 
though some of his friends attempted to persuade him to be a 
lawyer or businessman. (c) He shook his head and opened his 
eyes. As he struggled to get up, he saw something fall from his 
bag. It was a birthday card from his students, decorated with 
all kinds of odd-shaped but colorful hearts and scribbled 
names. “Dear Mr. Anderson, happy birthday to you. It’s our 
surprise gift for you. We love you!” Anderson could not help 
but smile. He already felt much better.
(D)
Today was especially busy and wearying, and Anderson 
wondered whether he was really suitable for teaching. He was 
stressed as kids constantly sought (d) his attention. At snack 
time, Emily wanted him to open her milk carton, so he did. As 
she was drinking, Scott spilled his milk and Anderson had to 
help (e) him clean it up. Then Jenny, Andrew, Mark, and . . . . 
Kids never ceased. However, he still loved them. That’s also 
what he had said in the interview for the position.
