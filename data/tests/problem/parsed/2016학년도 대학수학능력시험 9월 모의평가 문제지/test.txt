On my first day in the Emergency Center, I was about to 
drink my coffee when the first call came. I quickly picked up 
the line, “9-1-1.” My voice was trembling and my heart was 
racing. A woman cried, “My husband’s not breathing!” I 
instructed her to begin CPR. I was trying to be as steady as I 
could, but I was shaking. The situation was absolutely critical. 
While she was performing CPR, I immediately notified the 
nearby hospital. After a few tense moments, she came back on 
the line and shouted, “Where’s the ambulance?” I replied, 
“It’s getting there as quickly as it can.”

Merely having goals clearly defined is not sufficient, for 
one must also know, moment by moment, what precisely 
needs to be done. For instance, a salesperson’s aim is to 
conclude a sale profitably. However, each sale requires a 
different approach: Should he be pushy or laid back, 
authoritative or friendly? And what aspect of the product 
should he emphasize? The answers to these questions depend 
on variables that cannot be predicted in advance. This holds 
true not only for sales but also for most human activities. One 
must select a particular strategy appropriate to the occasion 
and follow the chosen course of action. Doing so will ensure 
more lasting success in reaching one’s goals.
① 비판적 분석에 기반을 두고 목표 설정을 해야 한다.
② 목표 달성을 위해 상황에 맞는 전략을 사용해야 한다.
③ 경제 활성화 전략 수립을 위해 시장 조사를 해야 한다.
④ 성공적인 업무 수행을 위해 작업 환경을 개선해야 한다.
⑤ 고객의 신뢰를 얻기 위해 일관된 전략을 사용해야 한다.

There is strong research evidence that children perform 
better in mathematics if music is incorporated in it. It has been 
shown that mathematics is related with music in various 
known ways so much that not putting the relationship to good 
use in and out of school could only be to our disadvantage. 
Researchers at a Los Angeles school found that 136 second 
year elementary school pupils who learned to play the piano 
and read music improved their numeracy skills. This could be 
so since learning music emphasizes thinking in space and 
time, and when pupils learn rhythm, they are learning ratios, 
fractions and proportions. Other researchers investigated the 
ways in which first and third grade teachers could integrate 
music into their regular math classrooms. They concluded that 
music-math integrated lessons had positive effects on three 
mathematical ability areas of modeling, problem solving and 
application.

22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Do you have the emotional state of mind to become a leader? 
People pay close attention to a leader’s subtle expressions of 
emotion through body language and facial expression. Some 
emotions such as enthusiasm can quickly become contagious. 
Others, such as depression or discouragement, can drag down 
the entire organization. Leaders with positive emotional states 
of mind are like human magnets. People naturally gravitate to 
them and want to follow them. Such leaders inspire enthusiasm 
in their organizations and attract the best people to work for 
them. Conversely, leaders who emit negative emotional states 
of mind, who are irritable and bossy, repel people and have few 
followers.
* contagious: 전염성의, 전파하는
** repel: 쫓아버리다
① reasons for leaders to hide their emotions
② influence of leaders’ emotional states on people
③ necessity for analyzing leaders’ states of mind
④ various ways of staying away from bad leaders
⑤ ways of strengthening emotional bonds among leaders
23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Effective coaches prioritize. They focus on a single task 
instead of trying to multitask. They understand that 
multitasking is another way of saying you are going to 
complete several tasks, none of which are going to be very 
good. Yuhong Jiang, professor of psychology at Harvard 
University, points out that the brain isn’t built to concentrate 
on two things at once. It works more slowly if it tries to. 
Effective coaches focus on those things that need to get done 
and separate out everything else. Separating what’s important 
from what’s not important is prioritizing. Ineffective coaches 
fail to put the big tasks first. They either believe they have 
unlimited time, thinking that they will have more time 
tomorrow to get something done, or they underestimate how 
much time they really do have. They have no ability to 
estimate how long a task will take.
① How Effective Coaches Approach Tasks
② Why Psychologists Support Multitasking
③ New Horizons of Research on Brain Science
④ Prioritizing Leads to Inefficiency in Performance
⑤ Everything Has Side Effects, But Not Multitasking!

Fruit and Vegetable Consumption
5 or More Times per Day, Canada, 2008
The above graph shows the percentages of fruit and 
vegetable consumption 5 or more times per day by age group 
and gender in Canada in 2008. ①Most notably, in each age 
group, the percentage of female consumption of fruit and 
vegetables 5 or more times per day was higher than that of 
males. ② Across all age groups, less than 50 percent of males 
consumed fruit and vegetables 5 or more times per day. 
③ Among female groups, the 25 to 34 age group showed the 
highest percentage; among male groups, the 12 to 17 age group 
did so. ④ The percentage gap between males and females in 
fruit and vegetable consumption 5 or more times per day was 
smallest in the 12 to 17 age group, and largest in the 18 to 24 
age group. ⑤ The percentage of female consumption of fruit 
and vegetables 5 or more times per day in the 18 to 24 age 
group was higher than that of the 35 to 44 age group by 0.1 
percentage point.
25. Richard Porson에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는
것은?
Richard Porson, one of Britain’s most notable classical 
scholars, was born on Christmas in 1759. His talents were 
recognized early, and he was sent to Eton College by wealthy 
sponsors at 15. Four years later, he entered Cambridge 
University. He significantly improved Greek texts and edited 
four plays written by Euripides. In 1806, he was elected 
Principal Librarian at the newly founded London Institution. 
During his lifetime, he collected a great many books on 
classical literature. Although the number of books he owned 
in total is simply unknown, an episode about his passion for 
books is well-known: he carried so many books that he was 
able to pull book after book out of his pocket when a student 
tried to show off his knowledge of Greek writers. Despite his 
fame as a classical scholar, he actually published little. On 
September 25, 1808, three months before reaching age 49, 
Porson died.
① 1759년 크리스마스에 태어났다.
② Euripides가 쓴 희곡 4편을 편집했다.
③ 고전 문학에 관한 수많은 책을 수집했다.
④ 책에 대한 열정과 관련된 일화가 있다.
⑤ 명성에 걸맞게 많은 책을 출판했다.

28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
The Internet and communication technologies play an 
ever-increasing role in the social lives of young people in 
developed societies. Adolescents have been quick to immerse 
themselves in technology with most ① using the Internet to 
communicate. Young people treat the mobile phone as an 
essential necessity of life and often prefer to use text messages 
to communicate with their friends. Young people also 
② increasingly access social networking websites. As 
technology and the Internet are a familiar resource for young 
people, it is logical ③ what they would seek assistance from 
this source. This has been shown by the increase in websites 
that provide therapeutic information for young people. A 
number of ‘youth friendly’ mental health websites ④ have 
been developed. The information ⑤ presented often takes the 
form of Frequently Asked Questions, fact sheets and suggested 
links. It would seem, therefore, logical to provide online 
counselling for young people.

An Egyptian executive, after entertaining his Canadian 
guest, offered him joint partnership in a new business venture. 
The Canadian, delighted with the offer, suggested that they 
meet again the next morning with their ① respective lawyers to 
finalize the details. The Egyptian never showed up. The 
surprised and disappointed Canadian tried to understand what 
had gone wrong: Did Egyptians ② lack punctuality? Was the 
Egyptian expecting a counter-offer? Were lawyers unavailable 
in Cairo? None of these explanations proved to be correct; 
rather, the problem was ③ caused by the different meaning 
Canadians and Egyptians attach to inviting lawyers. The 
Canadian regarded the lawyers’ ④ absence as facilitating the 
successful completion of the negotiation; the Egyptian 
interpreted it as signaling the Canadian’s mistrust of his 
verbal commitment. Canadians often use the impersonal 
formality of a lawyer’s services to finalize ⑤ agreements. 
Egyptians, by contrast, more frequently depend on the personal 
relationship between bargaining partners to accomplish the 
same purpose.

had spread with butter and homemade strawberry jam, Mom 
walked into the kitchen. She took one look at her little boy and 
started laughing; ② his little face and hands were covered with 
biscuit and jam. She thought how really cute he was. “Honey,

clean again. I guess when he gets through eating you can take 
④ him out and dump him in the bathtub.” Dad laughed. Slade 
giggled and tried to spit biscuit all over Dad. It didn’t hit 
⑤ him because luckily he avoided the spray. That made Mom 
laugh even more and soon the little cabin was full of love and 
laughter.

31. Early human societies were nomadic, based on hunting and 
gathering, and, in a shifting pattern of life in search of new 
sources of food, qualities such as lightness, portability, and 
adaptability were dominant criteria. With the evolution of more 
settled rural societies based on agriculture, other characteristics, 
other traditions of form appropriate to the new patterns of life, 
rapidly emerged. It must be emphasized, however, that tradition 
was not static, but constantly subject to minute variations 
appropriate to people and their circumstances. Although 
traditional forms reflected the experience of social groups, 
specific manifestations could be adapted in various minute and 
subtle ways to suit individual users’ needs. A chair could keep 
its basic, accepted characteristics while still being closely 
shaped in detail to the physique and proportions of a specific 
person. This basic principle of  allowed a 
constant stream of incremental modifications to be introduced, 
which, if demonstrated by experience to be advantageous, could 
be integrated back into the mainstream of tradition. [3점]

32. Investigators as a personality type place a high value on 
science, process, and learning. They excel at research, using 
logic and the information gained through their senses to 
conquer complex problems. Nothing thrills them more than a 
“big find.” Intellectual, introspective, and exceedingly 
detail-oriented, investigators are happiest when they’re using 
their brain power to pursue what they deem as a worthy 
outcome. They , and they 
dislike overly structured environments that necessitate a set 
response to challenges. Investigators are not interested in 
leadership, and developing the interpersonal skills necessary 
to fuel collaboration is a hurdle for many of them. They may 
feel insecure in their ability to “keep up” in their fields and 
can react badly when forced to put more important work on 
hold to complete a task that doesn’t intrigue them. [3점]
* introspective: 자기 성찰적인
** deem: 여기다, 생각하다
① attempt to go with the flow
② prefer to march to their own beat
③ dare to take the lead from the front
④ tend to work shoulder to shoulder
⑤ pay more attention to assigned tasks
33. It is easy to find examples of correlations which are far 
more systematic than could occur by chance and yet which it 
would be absurd to treat as evidence of a direct causal link. For 
instance, there is a high degree of correlation between shoe 
size and vocabulary size: people with larger shoe sizes tend to 
have much larger vocabularies than people with smaller shoe 
sizes. But having larger feet does not cause anyone to gain a 
larger vocabulary; nor does having a large vocabulary cause 
your feet to grow. The obvious explanation of the correlation 
is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults, and, 
because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they 
grow older, it is hardly surprising that, on average, people with 
smaller feet have smaller vocabularies. In other words, foot 
size and vocabulary size can be explained in terms of
from infancy 
to adulthood: a cause which both observed phenomena have in 
common. [3점]
① by-products of language acquisition
② causal links between uncommon events
③ contrasts between physical and mental growth
④ cultural beliefs derived from social interactions

Feedback is usually most effective when you offer it at the 
earliest opportunity, particularly if your objective is to teach 
someone a skill. (A) , if you are teaching your 
friend how to make your famous egg rolls, you provide a 
step-by-step commentary as you watch your pupil. If he makes 
a mistake, you don’t wait until the egg rolls are finished to tell 
him that he left out the cabbage. He needs immediate feedback 
to finish the rest of the sequence successfully. Sometimes, 
(B) , if a person is already sensitive and upset about 
something, delaying feedback can be wise. Use your critical 
thinking skills to analyze when feedback will do the most 
good. Rather than automatically offering immediate correction,

the person might make another mistake.

If you walk into a store looking for a new computer and 
the first salesperson you meet immediately points to a 
group of computers and says, “Any of those are good,” 
and then walks away, there is a good chance you will walk 
away, too, and with good reason.
(A) That is, the reader is the writer’s “customer” and one 
whose business or approval is one we need to seek. The 
more you know about your reader, the greater the chances 
you will meet his or her needs and expectations.
(B) Why? You were never asked what you were seeking, how 
much you could spend, or if the computer would be used 
for business or pleasure or your child’s homework 
assignments.
(C) In brief, the salesperson never considered or asked about 
your needs and preferences. Just as it would come as no 
surprise to learn the salesperson who was indifferent to a 
potential customer’s needs was soon out of a job, the 
same holds true for writers who ignore their readers.

According to one traditional definition, aesthetics is the 
branch of philosophy that deals with beauty, especially 
beauty in the arts. Examining the pleasing features of the 
Mona Lisa or a snow-capped mountain, for example, 
would come under aesthetics.
(A) Consider Picasso’s Guernica, a huge (11-ft. × 25.6-ft.) 
painting in black, white, and grey that he made in 
response to the slaughter of Spanish civilians by German 
and Italian warplanes during the Spanish Civil War. 
Images of a cruel war dominate the canvas.
(B) That definition seems too narrow, however, since works of 
art and natural objects may interest us in other ways than by 
being beautiful. Instead of evoking admiration of beauty, 
artists may evoke puzzlement, shock, and even disgust. 
(C) This work is widely admired but not for being beautiful. 
So a better definition of aesthetics would be that it is the 
branch of philosophy that deals with the ways things 
please people in being experienced.

Analysis of the errors leads the teacher to modify the 
teaching of these procedures, using the language ‘seven 
and three more’ rather than ‘seven, count on three’.
A 5-year-old doing addition problems by counting on makes 
the same error repeatedly, with responses such as: 7 + 3 = 9, 
6 + 5 = 10 and 8 + 4 = 11. ( ① ) The teacher asks the pupil to 
show how these answers were obtained and notices that in 
doing the addition of 3 to 7, the pupil counts ‘seven, eight, 
nine’, while turning up three fingers in turn. ( ② ) The pupil 
is ‘counting on 3 from 7’ but incorrectly starting at 7. ( ③ ) 
The teacher recalls similar errors that some pupils made when 
doing addition problems by counting on along a number 
line. ( ④ ) This is immediately effective. ( ⑤ ) So the 
teacher reinforces this particular language pattern in 
subsequent oral work with the whole class.

Still, many believe we will eventually reach a point at 
which conflict with the finite nature of resources is 
inevitable.
Can we sustain our standard of living in the same ecological 
space while consuming the resources of that space? This 
question is particularly relevant since we are living in an era 
of skyrocketing fuel costs and humans’ ever-growing carbon 
footprints. ( ① ) Some argue that we are already at a 
breaking point because we have nearly exhausted the Earth’s 
finite carrying capacity. ( ② ) However, it’s possible that 
innovations and cultural changes can expand Earth’s capacity. 
( ③ ) We are already seeing this as the world economies are 
increasingly looking at “green,” renewable industries like 
solar and hydrogen energy. ( ④ ) That means survival could 
ultimately depend on getting the human population below its 
carrying capacity. ( ⑤ ) Otherwise, without population 
control, the demand for resources will eventually exceed an 
ecosystem’s ability to provide it. [3점]

Scientific experiments should be designed to show that your 
hypothesis is wrong and should be conducted completely 
objectively with no possible subjective influence on the 
outcome. ① Unfortunately few, if any, scientists are truly 
objective as they have often decided long before the 
experiment is begun what they would like the result to be. 
② This means that very often bias is (unintentionally) 
introduced into the experiment, the experimental procedure or 
the interpretation of results. ③ It is all too easy to justify to 
yourself why an experiment which does not fit with your 
expectations should be ignored, and why one which provides 
the results you ‘hoped for’ is the right one. ④ It is important 
to draw a meaningful result from the experiment on peer 
group activities. ⑤ This can be partly avoided by conducting 
experiments ‘blinded’ and by asking others to check your data 
or repeat experiments.

Certain species are more crucial to the maintenance of 
their ecosystem than others. Such species, called keystone 
species, are vital in determining the nature and structure of 
the entire ecosystem. The fact that other species depend on 
or are greatly affected by the keystone species is revealed 
when the keystone species is removed. It is in this sense 
that we should draw attention to fig trees. Different species 
of fig trees may be keystone species in tropical rain 
forests. Although figs collectively produce a continuous 
crop of fruits, fruit-eating monkeys, birds, bats, and other 
vertebrates of the forest do not normally consume large 
quantities of figs in their diets. During the time of year 
when other fruits are less plentiful, however, fig trees 
become important in sustaining fruit-eating vertebrates. 
Should the fig trees disappear, most of the fruit-eating 
vertebrates would be eliminated. Protecting fig trees in 
such tropical rainforest ecosystems is an important 
conservation goal because it increases the likelihood that 
monkeys, birds, bats, and other vertebrates will survive.

True understanding inevitably requires a knowledge of 
context. The proper way of understanding a beast in a zoo is 
a telling example. At the zoo, visitors may witness a great 
beast pacing behind the bars of its cage. They may observe 
and admire the creature, its amazing bone structure, and its 
magnificent coat. However, no matter how long visitors 
spend in front of that cage, they will never truly understand 
the beast. True understanding can only come from seeing the 
creature in its natural surroundings and, in turn, the ways in 
which its presence affects its environment. 
What is true of the mysterious beast in the zoo is also true 
of science. To fully understand science, it must be 
considered within the society in which it functions. Science 
is not conducted in a . It is embedded within a 
social fabric, and just as a flesh-and-blood beast influences 
and is influenced by its environment, so too do science and 
society mutually influence one another. Society, through 
ethical and economic constraints, exerts a powerful influence 
on what science accomplishes. At the same time, the results 
of science have profound, and sometimes unexpected, 
impacts on every human being on earth. Therefore, to make 
sense of science-related issues, it is critical to recognize the 
bidirectional relationship between science and society.

(A)
Peter Anderson was exhausted when he finally opened the 
front door of his apartment. He teaches first graders, which 
means he lives in a world of riddles, birthday cakes, and 
pointless stories. (a) His world is dominated by 6-year-olds. 
Throwing himself with his leather bag on the long, 
comfortable sofa, he closed his eyes and reviewed the events 
of the day. 
(B)
It was held in a seminar room where Anderson met the 
principal for the first time three years ago. The principal 
asked why he chose to work with young children. (b) He 
answered that he loved helping children learn to write their 
names for the first time, finding someone a new friend, and 
sharing in the joy of reading. But, as time passed, his 
commitment and passion seemed to fade gradually. He 
recalled his strong conviction during the interview.
(C)
That’s why Anderson took the job in the first place even 
though some of his friends attempted to persuade him to be a 
lawyer or businessman. (c) He shook his head and opened his 
eyes. As he struggled to get up, he saw something fall from his 
bag. It was a birthday card from his students, decorated with 
all kinds of odd-shaped but colorful hearts and scribbled 
names. “Dear Mr. Anderson, happy birthday to you. It’s our 
surprise gift for you. We love you!” Anderson could not help 
but smile. He already felt much better.
(D)
Today was especially busy and wearying, and Anderson 
wondered whether he was really suitable for teaching. He was 
stressed as kids constantly sought (d) his attention. At snack 
time, Emily wanted him to open her milk carton, so he did. As 
she was drinking, Scott spilled his milk and Anderson had to 
help (e) him clean it up. Then Jenny, Andrew, Mark, and . . . . 
Kids never ceased. However, he still loved them. That’s also 
what he had said in the interview for the position.
