If you walk into a store looking for a new computer and 
the first salesperson you meet immediately points to a 
group of computers and says, “Any of those are good,” 
and then walks away, there is a good chance you will walk 
away, too, and with good reason.
(A) That is, the reader is the writer’s “customer” and one 
whose business or approval is one we need to seek. The 
more you know about your reader, the greater the chances 
you will meet his or her needs and expectations.
(B) Why? You were never asked what you were seeking, how 
much you could spend, or if the computer would be used 
for business or pleasure or your child’s homework 
assignments.
(C) In brief, the salesperson never considered or asked about 
your needs and preferences. Just as it would come as no 
surprise to learn the salesperson who was indifferent to a 
potential customer’s needs was soon out of a job, the 
same holds true for writers who ignore their readers.
