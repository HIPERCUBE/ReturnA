Today’s consumers are not just looking for a good 
product at a fair price. They are looking beyond the 
product or service to the ethics of the company that 
supplies it. The shift in focus by consumers is evident 
in their concerns about the companies they purchase 
from. For example, there is growing interest in labor 
practices, environmental policies, and social 
responsibilities. Also, there is a pressure to get 
companies to present not just financial results, but also 
social and environmental results and impact. Companies 
need to respond to the pressure because customers are 
voicing their concerns in every way, from boycotting 
stores to suing companies. Some multinational companies 
have experienced the       of ethical consumers in 
recent years, and have been forced to respond quickly to 
protect their reputations and their existence as 
companies.
This growing emphasis on ethical consumption is a 
trend that cannot be ignored. It is not going to go away. 
There are some important changes in the world 
indicating that ethical consumers will continue to be a 
growing force in the next few decades. Companies would 
do well to understand this trend and make efforts to 
deal with it.
