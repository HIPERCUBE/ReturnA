Social neuroscientist John Cacioppo conducted a brain 
imaging study to identify differences in the neural mechanisms 
of lonely and non-lonely people. Specifically, he wanted to 
know what’s going on in the brains of individuals with an acute 
sense of loneliness. While in an MRI machine, subjects viewed 
a series of images, some with positive associations, such as 
happy people doing fun things, and others with negative 
associations, such as scenes of people in dispute. As the two 
groups watched pleasant imagery, the area of the brain that 
recognizes rewards showed a significantly greater response in 
non-lonely people than in lonely people. Similarly, the visual 
cortex of lonely subjects responded much more strongly to 
unpleasant images of people than to unpleasant images of 
objects ―suggesting that the attention of lonely people is 
especially drawn to discord among people. Non-lonely 
subjects showed no such difference.
