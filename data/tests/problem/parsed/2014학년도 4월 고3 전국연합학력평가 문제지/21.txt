When we experience life’s setbacks and feel down, something 
strange happens. In a kind of relationship reflex, our bodies 
automatically begin to send signals to attract loving care from 
another person. Our eyelids droop, our gazes turn downward, 
our shoulders drop, and our faces seem to say, “Doesn’t anyone 
see how sad I am? Doesn’t anyone want to help me?” 
Conversely, something within us causes us to be attracted to 
those who seem in distress and who are flashing their 
depression displays. We may respond by saying, “Are you 
okay?” or “You look like you’re carrying the burdens of the 
world on your back,” or “You look like you could use a shoulder 
to lean on.” When we are wilted and drooping, our sadness 
signals are received by others who are strangely attracted by 
our messages.
