When we experience life’s setbacks and feel down, something 
strange happens. In a kind of relationship reflex, our bodies 
automatically begin to send signals to attract loving care from 
another person. Our eyelids droop, our gazes turn downward, 
our shoulders drop, and our faces seem to say, “Doesn’t anyone 
see how sad I am? Doesn’t anyone want to help me?” 
Conversely, something within us causes us to be attracted to 
those who seem in distress and who are flashing their 
depression displays. We may respond by saying, “Are you 
okay?” or “You look like you’re carrying the burdens of the 
world on your back,” or “You look like you could use a shoulder 
to lean on.” When we are wilted and drooping, our sadness 
signals are received by others who are strangely attracted by 
our messages.

When our minds are at ease, we’re more likely to direct the 
spotlight of attention inward, toward the stream of remote 
associations coming from the right hemisphere of our brains. In 
contrast, when we are diligently focused, our attention tends to 
be directed outward, toward the details of the problems we’re 
trying to solve. While this pattern of attention is necessary 
when solving problems analytically, it actually prevents us from 
detecting the connections that lead to creative insights. “That’s 
why so many insights happen during warm showers,” Subhra 
Bhattacharya, a well-known psychologist, says. “For many 
people, it’s the most relaxing part of the day.” It’s not until 
we’re being massaged by warm water, unable to check our 
e-mail, that we’re finally able to hear the quiet voices in the 
backs of our heads telling us about the insight. 
① the disadvantages of inward directed attention 
② the risk of being distracted by what arises in your mind 
③ ways of staying focused on the problem solving process 
④ positive effects of warm showers on emotional well-being 
⑤ the importance of a relaxed state of mind for reaching insights

Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. Physicists 
have given a fully (A) qualitative / quantitative definition to 
entropy that allows one to describe something’s entropy by 
using a definite numerical value: larger numbers mean 
greater entropy, smaller numbers mean less entropy. 
Although the details are a little complicated, this number, 
roughly speaking, counts the possible rearrangements of the 
(B) concepts / ingredients in a given physical system that 
leave its overall appearance intact. When your desk is neat 
and clean, almost any arrangement ― changing the order of the 
newspapers, books, or articles, moving the pens from their 
holders ― will upset its highly ordered organization. This 
accounts for its having low entropy. On the contrary, when your 
desk is a mess, numerous rearrangements of the newspapers, 
articles, and junk mail will leave it a mess and therefore will 
not (C) disturb / maintain its overall look. This accounts for its 
having high entropy. 
(A) (B) (C)
① qualitative …… concepts …… disturb
② qualitative …… ingredients …… maintain
③ quantitative …… ingredients …… maintain
④ quantitative …… concepts …… maintain
⑤ quantitative …… ingredients …… disturb

In some communities, music and performance have 
successfully transformed whole neighborhoods as ① profoundly 
as The Guggenheim Museum did in Bilbao. In Salvador, Brazil, 
musician Carlinhos Brown established several music and 
culture centers in formerly dangerous neighborhoods. In 
Candeal, ② where Brown was born, local kids were encouraged 
to join drum groups, sing, and stage performances. The kids, 
energized by these activities, ③ began to turn away from 
dealing drugs. Being a young criminal was no longer their only 
life option. Being musicians and playing together in a group 
looked like more fun and was more ④ satisfying. Little by little,    
the crime rate dropped in those neighborhoods; the hope 
returned. In another slum area, possibly inspired by Brown’s 
example, a culture center began to encourage the local kids to 
stage musical events, some of ⑤ them dramatized the tragedy 
that they were still recovering from.

At the opposite side of the valley, a narrow steep road led 
into the sloping hills. Along this road there now appeared two 
round glaring eyes. They would appear and disappear and 
appear again, each time rounder, more glaring, larger. Cusi was 
terrified. It must be an animal from another world. The lights 
came nearer and nearer with a strange noise and a still stranger 
smell. Then they disappeared completely. Chuto quietly 
laughed, looking down at Cusi’s set face. “Come,” he said to the 
boy. Cusi made himself follow the old Inca man across the 
terraces to the beginning of the road. “They call this thing a 
truck,” Chuto explained. “It won’t hurt you. It has wheels 
instead of feet. It has a motor instead of a heart. It has 
bad-smelling blood by the name of gasoline.” Cusi could finally 
catch his breath and feel more at ease. 28

The cottage of a poor man named Nicholas happened to stand 
in a place which was overgrown with wild bushes. ① He lay 
down under the shade of a hazel tree upon a hot day, about the 
time of harvest. A farmer passed close by ② him with a cart 
heavily loaded with corn. With envious eyes Nicholas looked at 
the cart full of corn, and barely said “Good morning” to the 
farmer. ③ He, however, stopped, and said to Nicholas, “If from 
this land, which is your property, you would cultivate daily as 
many feet as you cover with your lazy body, you would reap 
every year much more corn than you see upon the cart here.” 
Nicholas paid attention to this　advice. ④ He rooted up bushes, 
and worked upon the soil. It cost Nicholas not a single penny, 
and placed ⑤ him and his family in affluent circumstances.

The graph above shows the best advertising sources that US 
consumers and marketers chose in October 2012 when they 
were permitted to select up to two choices. ① According to 
survey findings, more than 40 percent of both consumers and 
marketers rated Newspapers and TV as the best source for 
advertising. ② As for Family and Friends as an advertising 
source, the percentage gap between the preferences of 
consumers and marketers was biggest, at nine percent. ③ On 
the other hand, consumers and marketers showed only a one 
percent difference in their preference for Company websites. 
④ Among all the advertising sources listed, News websites 
were chosen by a smaller proportion of marketers than

two choices, while four percent of consumers favored them as 
an advertising source.

The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is something to behold 
in the Barren Lands of the North. It is the supply route to highly 
profitable diamond mines in the remote Canadian wilderness, 
stretching approximately six hundred kilometers. Approximately 
80 percent of the ice road consists of frozen lakes. The road is 
built by a joint venture of mining companies operating in the area, 
and shared by many users, from exploration companies to native 
hunters of the region. This seasonal winter road is only open for 
eight to nine weeks each year, from February to the beginning of 
April depending on weather and the season’s load requirements. 
During the rest of the year, the mines can be reached only by air. 
Travel time on the ice road is generally around 14 hours and speed 
of vehicles is carefully controlled to protect the ice.
