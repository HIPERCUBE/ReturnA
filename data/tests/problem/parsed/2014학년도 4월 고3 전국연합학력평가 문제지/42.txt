[43 ~ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. 45
(A)
At a high school in Utah, the administration organized a 
mentor program that teamed up one special-needs student 
with a mainstream student who would help him or her along. 
The football coach presented the idea to John, the captain of 
the team. John was a tall, strong, intense young man ― not 
the caring type needed for this kind of program. He made it 
clear that this “wasn’t his thing” and (a) he didn’t have time 
to be a mentor. 
(B)
At the end of the football season, the team won the state 
championship, and John was awarded with a gold medal as 
the Most Valuable Player in the state. Randy was presented 
with a football team jacket. The team cheered as Randy put 
it on. It was the coolest thing that had ever happened to 
him. From that day forward, (b) he never took it off. He 
slept in his jacket and wore it throughout each weekend.
(C)
The coach knew it would be good for John and insisted that 
(c) he volunteer. John was matched up with Randy, one of the 
mentees in the program. Reluctant and irritated at first, he 
literally tried to “lose” Randy, but soon John welcomed the 
constant company. Randy not only attended every one of 
(d) his classes and ate with him at lunchtime, he also went 
to football practice. After a few days, John asked the coach to 
make Randy the official manager responsible for the balls, 
tape, and water bottles. 
(D)
After the big win the two were inseparable. Not only did John 
take Randy to special occasions like dances but he also took 
Randy to the library to tutor him. As he tutored Randy, John 
became a much better student and made the honor roll for the 
first time. The mentor program turned out to be one of the most 
rewarding experiences of (e) his life. John went to college on a 
full athletic scholarship and graduated with a master’s degree 
in education. Today John is a special education teacher and 
volunteers ten hours a week for the Special Olympics.
