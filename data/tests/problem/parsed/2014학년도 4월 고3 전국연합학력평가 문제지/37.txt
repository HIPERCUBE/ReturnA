Like any other organ or system in the body, bone becomes 
stronger when it is stressed regularly, and it becomes weak 
when it is not used enough. ① In this case, “stressed” means 
loaded through impact and tension, as occurs during running. 
② For the best explanation of bones becoming weak, take a 
look at astronauts. ③ Their bones are unloaded and not used 
much during lengthy stays in the zero-gravity environment of 
space. ④ As people age, the body starts to reabsorb calcium 
from the bones, leading to loss of bone mass. ⑤ When they 
arrive back on Earth, their bones are often so weak that they 
can barely support the astronaut’s body weight.
