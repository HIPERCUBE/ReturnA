Surely since we all have the same visual equipment, we all 
see something as basic as color in the same way? Wrong. It 
turns out that color vision isn’t a black-and-white issue. It’s 
not nearly that simple.   
(A) However, the number of differently labeled segments we use 
varies. Some languages only distinguish between two basic 
colors, black and white. Others add green, yellow, blue, and 
brown. 
(B) Language has a significant effect on how we “see” colors
― more precisely, on how we divide up and label different 
parts of the visible spectrum. Our eyes register roughly 
the same range of light between the aptly named infrared 
and ultraviolet. 
(C) This sort of different color categorization is nicely 
illustrated by the word “grue.” Psychologists use it to 
describe languages that make no distinction between 
green and blue.
