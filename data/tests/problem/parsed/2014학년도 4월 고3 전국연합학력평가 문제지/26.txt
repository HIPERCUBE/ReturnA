The cottage of a poor man named Nicholas happened to stand 
in a place which was overgrown with wild bushes. ① He lay 
down under the shade of a hazel tree upon a hot day, about the 
time of harvest. A farmer passed close by ② him with a cart 
heavily loaded with corn. With envious eyes Nicholas looked at 
the cart full of corn, and barely said “Good morning” to the 
farmer. ③ He, however, stopped, and said to Nicholas, “If from 
this land, which is your property, you would cultivate daily as 
many feet as you cover with your lazy body, you would reap 
every year much more corn than you see upon the cart here.” 
Nicholas paid attention to this　advice. ④ He rooted up bushes, 
and worked upon the soil. It cost Nicholas not a single penny, 
and placed ⑤ him and his family in affluent circumstances.

The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is something to behold 
in the Barren Lands of the North. It is the supply route to highly 
profitable diamond mines in the remote Canadian wilderness, 
stretching approximately six hundred kilometers. Approximately 
80 percent of the ice road consists of frozen lakes. The road is 
built by a joint venture of mining companies operating in the area, 
and shared by many users, from exploration companies to native 
hunters of the region. This seasonal winter road is only open for 
eight to nine weeks each year, from February to the beginning of 
April depending on weather and the season’s load requirements. 
During the rest of the year, the mines can be reached only by air. 
Travel time on the ice road is generally around 14 hours and speed 
of vehicles is carefully controlled to protect the ice.
