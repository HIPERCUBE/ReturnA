CASEY HIGH SCHOOL  
DAILY ANNOUNCEMENT
(Thursday, April 10, 2014)
Dear Students,
As we have already announced, times for each 
school bus during the morning commute are departure 
times, and afternoon commute times are arrival times. 
Due to very tight schedules and extreme traffic 
conditions, our drivers and security attendants are 
trained not to wait for late students. Students should 
arrive at the bus stop approximately 5 minutes before 
the scheduled departure in the morning. This ensures 
riders are ready to board the bus when it reaches the 
stop and promotes an on-time arrival at school. The 
same applies for the afternoon commute. 
Barbara Howe,
Principal

Child-rearing experts always caution parents not to tell children 
they’re bad when they misbehave, but rather to scold them for 
doing bad things. This concept applies to adults, as well. Good 
people occasionally do bad things, and bad people sometimes 
behave like angels. In looking for patterns, it is critical not to 
confuse occasional behavior or feelings with a more permanent 
personality trait or quality. If you’re considering rehiring someone 
who worked for you a few years earlier, you’d be wise to recall 
your past experience with him. But you’d be ill-advised to base the 
decision on a single occasion when he disagreed with you, unless 
you saw other behavior that indicated he was argumentative by 
nature. Isolated episodes don’t usually reveal a permanent state of 
mind. As you search for patterns, ask yourself whether the clue you 
are evaluating is just an isolated event.
① 단편적인 모습으로 그 사람을 판단해서는 안 된다. 
② 시대의 변화에 따라 자녀 양육 방식도 달라져야 한다. 
③ 옳고 그름을 판단하는 기준은 사람마다 다를 수 있다. 
④ 성과보다는 성장 가능성을 고려하여 사람을 평가해야 한다. 
⑤ 겉으로 드러난 자녀의 행동만으로 잘잘못을 따져서는 안 된다.

Do you know what fear and doubt fear? Community. One of fear 
and doubt’s chief aims is to make you feel alone, like you’re the 
only one who feels a certain way. Fear wants to isolate you and 
put you on an island. As long as you keep your fear to yourself, 
no one can tell you the truth about it. No one can help you see 
what is really going on. No one can encourage you. So if you’re 
going to tell your voices, “Go away,” you’ve got to share them 
with other people. You’ve got to tell your close friends or family 
or a counselor about your voices. The exact person will be 
different for everyone, but never waste time trying to battle a 
voice alone. In some cases that voice of fear and doubt will have 
had a ten-year head start on you. Don’t go it alone. 
① 두려움과 의심을 주변 사람과 나누어라. 
② 새로운 도전에 대한 두려움과 의심을 버려라. 
③ 외로움을 극복하려면 혼자 있는 시간을 즐겨라. 
④ 자신의 목소리를 낮추고 함께하는 삶을 추구하라. 
⑤ 어떤 상황에서도 진실을 말할 수 있는 용기를 가져라.

21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? 
When we experience life’s setbacks and feel down, something 
strange happens. In a kind of relationship reflex, our bodies 
automatically begin to send signals to attract loving care from 
another person. Our eyelids droop, our gazes turn downward, 
our shoulders drop, and our faces seem to say, “Doesn’t anyone 
see how sad I am? Doesn’t anyone want to help me?” 
Conversely, something within us causes us to be attracted to 
those who seem in distress and who are flashing their 
depression displays. We may respond by saying, “Are you 
okay?” or “You look like you’re carrying the burdens of the 
world on your back,” or “You look like you could use a shoulder 
to lean on.” When we are wilted and drooping, our sadness 
signals are received by others who are strangely attracted by 
our messages.

② The Depression Display: A Strange Attractor 
③ A Step Toward Ideal Relationships with Others 
④ Body Language: A Way of Hiding Your Emotions 
⑤ Facial Expressions: Indicators of a Health Disorder    
. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? 
When our minds are at ease, we’re more likely to direct the 
spotlight of attention inward, toward the stream of remote 
associations coming from the right hemisphere of our brains. In 
contrast, when we are diligently focused, our attention tends to 
be directed outward, toward the details of the problems we’re 
trying to solve. While this pattern of attention is necessary 
when solving problems analytically, it actually prevents us from 
detecting the connections that lead to creative insights. “That’s 
why so many insights happen during warm showers,” Subhra 
Bhattacharya, a well-known psychologist, says. “For many 
people, it’s the most relaxing part of the day.” It’s not until 
we’re being massaged by warm water, unable to check our 
e-mail, that we’re finally able to hear the quiet voices in the 
backs of our heads telling us about the insight. 
① the disadvantages of inward directed attention 
② the risk of being distracted by what arises in your mind 
③ ways of staying focused on the problem solving process 
④ positive effects of warm showers on emotional well-being 
⑤ the importance of a relaxed state of mind for reaching insights
. 다음 글의 (A) ~(C)에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말을 바르게 짝지은 것은?
[3점]
Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. Physicists 
have given a fully (A) qualitative / quantitative definition to 
entropy that allows one to describe something’s entropy by 
using a definite numerical value: larger numbers mean 
greater entropy, smaller numbers mean less entropy. 
Although the details are a little complicated, this number, 
roughly speaking, counts the possible rearrangements of the 
(B) concepts / ingredients in a given physical system that 
leave its overall appearance intact. When your desk is neat 
and clean, almost any arrangement ― changing the order of the 
newspapers, books, or articles, moving the pens from their 
holders ― will upset its highly ordered organization. This 
accounts for its having low entropy. On the contrary, when your 
desk is a mess, numerous rearrangements of the newspapers, 
articles, and junk mail will leave it a mess and therefore will 
not (C) disturb / maintain its overall look. This accounts for its 
having high entropy. 
(A) (B) (C)
① qualitative …… concepts …… disturb
② qualitative …… ingredients …… maintain
③ quantitative …… ingredients …… maintain
④ quantitative …… concepts …… maintain
⑤ quantitative …… ingredients …… disturb

In some communities, music and performance have 
successfully transformed whole neighborhoods as ① profoundly 
as The Guggenheim Museum did in Bilbao. In Salvador, Brazil, 
musician Carlinhos Brown established several music and 
culture centers in formerly dangerous neighborhoods. In 
Candeal, ② where Brown was born, local kids were encouraged 
to join drum groups, sing, and stage performances. The kids, 
energized by these activities, ③ began to turn away from 
dealing drugs. Being a young criminal was no longer their only 
life option. Being musicians and playing together in a group 
looked like more fun and was more ④ satisfying. Little by little,    
the crime rate dropped in those neighborhoods; the hope 
returned. In another slum area, possibly inspired by Brown’s 
example, a culture center began to encourage the local kids to 
stage musical events, some of ⑤ them dramatized the tragedy 
that they were still recovering from.

At the opposite side of the valley, a narrow steep road led 
into the sloping hills. Along this road there now appeared two 
round glaring eyes. They would appear and disappear and 
appear again, each time rounder, more glaring, larger. Cusi was 
terrified. It must be an animal from another world. The lights 
came nearer and nearer with a strange noise and a still stranger 
smell. Then they disappeared completely. Chuto quietly 
laughed, looking down at Cusi’s set face. “Come,” he said to the 
boy. Cusi made himself follow the old Inca man across the 
terraces to the beginning of the road. “They call this thing a 
truck,” Chuto explained. “It won’t hurt you. It has wheels 
instead of feet. It has a motor instead of a heart. It has 
bad-smelling blood by the name of gasoline.” Cusi could finally 
catch his breath and feel more at ease. 28

The cottage of a poor man named Nicholas happened to stand 
in a place which was overgrown with wild bushes. ① He lay 
down under the shade of a hazel tree upon a hot day, about the 
time of harvest. A farmer passed close by ② him with a cart 
heavily loaded with corn. With envious eyes Nicholas looked at 
the cart full of corn, and barely said “Good morning” to the 
farmer. ③ He, however, stopped, and said to Nicholas, “If from 
this land, which is your property, you would cultivate daily as 
many feet as you cover with your lazy body, you would reap 
every year much more corn than you see upon the cart here.” 
Nicholas paid attention to this　advice. ④ He rooted up bushes, 
and worked upon the soil. It cost Nicholas not a single penny, 
and placed ⑤ him and his family in affluent circumstances.

advertising. ② As for Family and Friends as an advertising 
source, the percentage gap between the preferences of 
consumers and marketers was biggest, at nine percent. ③ On 
the other hand, consumers and marketers showed only a one 
percent difference in their preference for Company websites. 
④ Among all the advertising sources listed, News websites 
were chosen by a smaller proportion of marketers than 
consumers. ⑤ Marketers did not name Blogs as one of their top 
two choices, while four percent of consumers favored them as

The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is something to behold 
in the Barren Lands of the North. It is the supply route to highly 
profitable diamond mines in the remote Canadian wilderness, 
stretching approximately six hundred kilometers. Approximately 
80 percent of the ice road consists of frozen lakes. The road is 
built by a joint venture of mining companies operating in the area, 
and shared by many users, from exploration companies to native 
hunters of the region. This seasonal winter road is only open for 
eight to nine weeks each year, from February to the beginning of 
April depending on weather and the season’s load requirements. 
During the rest of the year, the mines can be reached only by air. 
Travel time on the ice road is generally around 14 hours and speed 
of vehicles is carefully controlled to protect the ice.
