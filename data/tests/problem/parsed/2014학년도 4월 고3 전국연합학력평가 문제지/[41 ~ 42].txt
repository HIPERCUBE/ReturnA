In an experiment, researchers monitored college students 
taking part in a program to improve their skills at studying. 
They randomly assigned the students to three planning 
conditions. One group was instructed to make daily plans for 
what, where, and when to study. Another made similar plans, 
only month by month instead of day by day. And the third 
group, the controls, did not make plans. The researchers 
predicted that the day-by-day plans would work best. But 
they were wrong. The monthly planning group did the best in 
terms of improvements in study habits and attitudes. 
Monthly planners also kept it up much longer than the daily 
planners, and the continued planning thus was more likely to 
carry over into their work after the program ended. 
Why? Daily plans do have the advantage of letting the 
person know exactly what he or she should be doing at each 
moment. But their preparation is time-consuming, because it 
takes much longer to make thirty daily plans than a broad plan 
for the month without any daily details. Another drawback of 
daily plans is that they lack flexibility. They deprive the 
person of the chance to make choices along the way, so the 
person feels locked into a rigid and grinding sequence of tasks. 
Life rarely goes exactly according to plan, and so the daily 
plans can be demoralizing as soon as you fall off schedule. 
With a monthly plan, you can make                    . If a delay 
arises one day, your plan is still intact.
