30. The saying that                                                             is 
captured in a study in which researchers wrote up a detailed 
description of a half inning of baseball and gave it to a group of 
baseball fanatics and a group of less enthusiastic fans to read. 
Afterward they tested how well their subjects could recall the 
half inning. The baseball fanatics structured their recollections 
around important game-related events, like runners advancing 
and runs scored. One almost got the impression they were 
reading off an internal scorecard. The less enthusiastic fans 
remembered fewer important facts about the game and were 
more likely to recount superficial details like the weather. 
Because they lacked a detailed internal representation of the 
game, they couldn’t process the information they were taking 
in. They didn’t know what was important and what was trivial. 
They couldn’t know what mattered. Without a conceptual 
framework in which to embed what they were learning, they 
were extremely forgetful. [3점]
