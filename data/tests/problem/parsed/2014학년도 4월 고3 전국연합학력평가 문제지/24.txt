In some communities, music and performance have 
successfully transformed whole neighborhoods as ① profoundly 
as The Guggenheim Museum did in Bilbao. In Salvador, Brazil, 
musician Carlinhos Brown established several music and 
culture centers in formerly dangerous neighborhoods. In 
Candeal, ② where Brown was born, local kids were encouraged 
to join drum groups, sing, and stage performances. The kids, 
energized by these activities, ③ began to turn away from 
dealing drugs. Being a young criminal was no longer their only 
life option. Being musicians and playing together in a group 
looked like more fun and was more ④ satisfying. Little by little, 
the crime rate dropped in those neighborhoods; the hope 
returned. In another slum area, possibly inspired by Brown’s 
example, a culture center began to encourage the local kids to 
stage musical events, some of ⑤ them dramatized the tragedy 
that they were still recovering from.
