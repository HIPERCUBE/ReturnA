Leaders, on the other hand, don’t care very much for 
organizational structure or the official blessing of whatever 
factory they work for. 
If leadership is the ability to create change your organization 
believes in, and the market demands change, then the market 
demands leaders, not managers. ( ① ) Managers manage by 
using the authority the factory gives them, and you listen to your 
manager to avoid losing your job. ( ② ) A manager can’t make 
change because that’s not his job; his job is to complete tasks 
assigned to him by someone else in the factory. ( ③ ) They use 
passion and ideas to lead people, as opposed to using threats and 
bureaucracy to manage them. ( ④ ) Leaders must become 
aware of how the organization works, because this awareness 
allows them to change it. ( ⑤ ) Leadership doesn’t always start ①③
at the top, but it always manages to affect the folks at the top.  ⑤

Surely since we all have the same visual equipment, we all 
see something as basic as color in the same way? Wrong. It 
turns out that color vision isn’t a black-and-white issue. It’s 
not nearly that simple.   
(A) However, the number of differently labeled segments we use 
varies. Some languages only distinguish between two basic 
colors, black and white. Others add green, yellow, blue, and 
brown. 
(B) Language has a significant effect on how we “see” colors
― more precisely, on how we divide up and label different 
parts of the visible spectrum. Our eyes register roughly 
the same range of light between the aptly named infrared 
and ultraviolet. 
(C) This sort of different color categorization is nicely 
illustrated by the word “grue.” Psychologists use it to 
describe languages that make no distinction between 
green and blue.

Social neuroscientist John Cacioppo conducted a brain 
imaging study to identify differences in the neural mechanisms 
of lonely and non-lonely people. Specifically, he wanted to 
know what’s going on in the brains of individuals with an acute 
sense of loneliness. While in an MRI machine, subjects viewed 
a series of images, some with positive associations, such as 
happy people doing fun things, and others with negative 
associations, such as scenes of people in dispute. As the two 
groups watched pleasant imagery, the area of the brain that 
recognizes rewards showed a significantly greater response in 
non-lonely people than in lonely people. Similarly, the visual 
cortex of lonely subjects responded much more strongly to 
unpleasant images of people than to unpleasant images of 
objects ―suggesting that the attention of lonely people is 
especially drawn to discord among people. Non-lonely 
subjects showed no such difference.

(A)
At a high school in Utah, the administration organized a 
mentor program that teamed up one special-needs student 
with a mainstream student who would help him or her along. 
The football coach presented the idea to John, the captain of 
the team. John was a tall, strong, intense young man ― not 
the caring type needed for this kind of program. He made it 
clear that this “wasn’t his thing” and (a) he didn’t have time 
to be a mentor. 
(B)
At the end of the football season, the team won the state 
championship, and John was awarded with a gold medal as 
the Most Valuable Player in the state. Randy was presented 
with a football team jacket. The team cheered as Randy put 
it on. It was the coolest thing that had ever happened to 
him. From that day forward, (b) he never took it off. He 
slept in his jacket and wore it throughout each weekend.
(C)
The coach knew it would be good for John and insisted that 
(c) he volunteer. John was matched up with Randy, one of the 
mentees in the program. Reluctant and irritated at first, he 
literally tried to “lose” Randy, but soon John welcomed the 
constant company. Randy not only attended every one of 
(d) his classes and ate with him at lunchtime, he also went 
to football practice. After a few days, John asked the coach to 
make Randy the official manager responsible for the balls, 
tape, and water bottles. 
(D)
After the big win the two were inseparable. Not only did John 
take Randy to special occasions like dances but he also took 
Randy to the library to tutor him. As he tutored Randy, John 
became a much better student and made the honor roll for the 
first time. The mentor program turned out to be one of the most 
rewarding experiences of (e) his life. John went to college on a 
full athletic scholarship and graduated with a master’s degree 
in education. Today John is a special education teacher and 
volunteers ten hours a week for the Special Olympics.
