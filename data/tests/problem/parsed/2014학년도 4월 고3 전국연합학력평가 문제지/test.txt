CASEY HIGH SCHOOL  
DAILY ANNOUNCEMENT
(Thursday, April 10, 2014)
Dear Students,
As we have already announced, times for each 
school bus during the morning commute are departure 
times, and afternoon commute times are arrival times. 
Due to very tight schedules and extreme traffic 
conditions, our drivers and security attendants are 
trained not to wait for late students. Students should 
arrive at the bus stop approximately 5 minutes before 
the scheduled departure in the morning. This ensures 
riders are ready to board the bus when it reaches the 
stop and promotes an on-time arrival at school. The 
same applies for the afternoon commute. 
Barbara Howe,
Principal

Child-rearing experts always caution parents not to tell children 
they’re bad when they misbehave, but rather to scold them for 
doing bad things. This concept applies to adults, as well. Good 
people occasionally do bad things, and bad people sometimes 
behave like angels. In looking for patterns, it is critical not to 
confuse occasional behavior or feelings with a more permanent 
personality trait or quality. If you’re considering rehiring someone 
who worked for you a few years earlier, you’d be wise to recall 
your past experience with him. But you’d be ill-advised to base the 
decision on a single occasion when he disagreed with you, unless 
you saw other behavior that indicated he was argumentative by 
nature. Isolated episodes don’t usually reveal a permanent state of 
mind. As you search for patterns, ask yourself whether the clue you 
are evaluating is just an isolated event.

Do you know what fear and doubt fear? Community. One of fear 
and doubt’s chief aims is to make you feel alone, like you’re the 
only one who feels a certain way. Fear wants to isolate you and 
put you on an island. As long as you keep your fear to yourself, 
no one can tell you the truth about it. No one can help you see 
what is really going on. No one can encourage you. So if you’re 
going to tell your voices, “Go away,” you’ve got to share them 
with other people. You’ve got to tell your close friends or family 
or a counselor about your voices. The exact person will be 
different for everyone, but never waste time trying to battle a 
voice alone. In some cases that voice of fear and doubt will have 
had a ten-year head start on you. Don’t go it alone.

21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? 
When we experience life’s setbacks and feel down, something 
strange happens. In a kind of relationship reflex, our bodies 
automatically begin to send signals to attract loving care from 
another person. Our eyelids droop, our gazes turn downward, 
our shoulders drop, and our faces seem to say, “Doesn’t anyone 
see how sad I am? Doesn’t anyone want to help me?” 
Conversely, something within us causes us to be attracted to 
those who seem in distress and who are flashing their 
depression displays. We may respond by saying, “Are you 
okay?” or “You look like you’re carrying the burdens of the 
world on your back,” or “You look like you could use a shoulder 
to lean on.” When we are wilted and drooping, our sadness 
signals are received by others who are strangely attracted by 
our messages.

When our minds are at ease, we’re more likely to direct the 
spotlight of attention inward, toward the stream of remote 
associations coming from the right hemisphere of our brains. In 
contrast, when we are diligently focused, our attention tends to 
be directed outward, toward the details of the problems we’re 
trying to solve. While this pattern of attention is necessary 
when solving problems analytically, it actually prevents us from 
detecting the connections that lead to creative insights. “That’s 
why so many insights happen during warm showers,” Subhra 
Bhattacharya, a well-known psychologist, says. “For many 
people, it’s the most relaxing part of the day.” It’s not until 
we’re being massaged by warm water, unable to check our 
e-mail, that we’re finally able to hear the quiet voices in the 
backs of our heads telling us about the insight. 
① the disadvantages of inward directed attention 
② the risk of being distracted by what arises in your mind 
③ ways of staying focused on the problem solving process 
④ positive effects of warm showers on emotional well-being 
⑤ the importance of a relaxed state of mind for reaching insights

Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. Physicists 
have given a fully (A) qualitative / quantitative definition to 
entropy that allows one to describe something’s entropy by 
using a definite numerical value: larger numbers mean 
greater entropy, smaller numbers mean less entropy. 
Although the details are a little complicated, this number, 
roughly speaking, counts the possible rearrangements of the 
(B) concepts / ingredients in a given physical system that 
leave its overall appearance intact. When your desk is neat 
and clean, almost any arrangement ― changing the order of the 
newspapers, books, or articles, moving the pens from their 
holders ― will upset its highly ordered organization. This 
accounts for its having low entropy. On the contrary, when your 
desk is a mess, numerous rearrangements of the newspapers, 
articles, and junk mail will leave it a mess and therefore will 
not (C) disturb / maintain its overall look. This accounts for its 
having high entropy. 
(A) (B) (C)
① qualitative …… concepts …… disturb
② qualitative …… ingredients …… maintain
③ quantitative …… ingredients …… maintain
④ quantitative …… concepts …… maintain
⑤ quantitative …… ingredients …… disturb

In some communities, music and performance have 
successfully transformed whole neighborhoods as ① profoundly 
as The Guggenheim Museum did in Bilbao. In Salvador, Brazil, 
musician Carlinhos Brown established several music and 
culture centers in formerly dangerous neighborhoods. In 
Candeal, ② where Brown was born, local kids were encouraged 
to join drum groups, sing, and stage performances. The kids, 
energized by these activities, ③ began to turn away from 
dealing drugs. Being a young criminal was no longer their only 
life option. Being musicians and playing together in a group 
looked like more fun and was more ④ satisfying. Little by little,    
the crime rate dropped in those neighborhoods; the hope 
returned. In another slum area, possibly inspired by Brown’s 
example, a culture center began to encourage the local kids to 
stage musical events, some of ⑤ them dramatized the tragedy 
that they were still recovering from.

At the opposite side of the valley, a narrow steep road led 
into the sloping hills. Along this road there now appeared two 
round glaring eyes. They would appear and disappear and 
appear again, each time rounder, more glaring, larger. Cusi was 
terrified. It must be an animal from another world. The lights 
came nearer and nearer with a strange noise and a still stranger 
smell. Then they disappeared completely. Chuto quietly 
laughed, looking down at Cusi’s set face. “Come,” he said to the 
boy. Cusi made himself follow the old Inca man across the 
terraces to the beginning of the road. “They call this thing a 
truck,” Chuto explained. “It won’t hurt you. It has wheels 
instead of feet. It has a motor instead of a heart. It has 
bad-smelling blood by the name of gasoline.” Cusi could finally 
catch his breath and feel more at ease. 28

The cottage of a poor man named Nicholas happened to stand 
in a place which was overgrown with wild bushes. ① He lay 
down under the shade of a hazel tree upon a hot day, about the 
time of harvest. A farmer passed close by ② him with a cart 
heavily loaded with corn. With envious eyes Nicholas looked at 
the cart full of corn, and barely said “Good morning” to the 
farmer. ③ He, however, stopped, and said to Nicholas, “If from 
this land, which is your property, you would cultivate daily as 
many feet as you cover with your lazy body, you would reap 
every year much more corn than you see upon the cart here.” 
Nicholas paid attention to this　advice. ④ He rooted up bushes, 
and worked upon the soil. It cost Nicholas not a single penny, 
and placed ⑤ him and his family in affluent circumstances.

consumers and marketers chose in October 2012 when they 
were permitted to select up to two choices. ① According to 
survey findings, more than 40 percent of both consumers and 
marketers rated Newspapers and TV as the best source for 
advertising. ② As for Family and Friends as an advertising 
source, the percentage gap between the preferences of 
consumers and marketers was biggest, at nine percent. ③ On 
the other hand, consumers and marketers showed only a one 
percent difference in their preference for Company websites. 
④ Among all the advertising sources listed, News websites 
were chosen by a smaller proportion of marketers than 
consumers. ⑤ Marketers did not name Blogs as one of their top 
two choices, while four percent of consumers favored them as

The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road is something to behold 
in the Barren Lands of the North. It is the supply route to highly 
profitable diamond mines in the remote Canadian wilderness, 
stretching approximately six hundred kilometers. Approximately 
80 percent of the ice road consists of frozen lakes. The road is 
built by a joint venture of mining companies operating in the area, 
and shared by many users, from exploration companies to native 
hunters of the region. This seasonal winter road is only open for 
eight to nine weeks each year, from February to the beginning of 
April depending on weather and the season’s load requirements. 
During the rest of the year, the mines can be reached only by air. 
Travel time on the ice road is generally around 14 hours and speed 
of vehicles is carefully controlled to protect the ice.

be was detailed by researchers in a 2006 paper published in the 
journal Science. They conducted a study in which people were 
asked to remember a terrible sin from their past, something they 
had done which was unethical. The researchers asked them to 
describe how the memory made them feel. They then offered 
half of the participants the opportunity to wash their hands. At 
the end of the study, they asked subjects if they would be 
willing to take part in later research for no pay as a favor to a 
desperate graduate student. Those who did not wash their hands 
agreed to help 74 percent of the time, but those who did wash 
agreed only 41 percent of the time. According to the researchers, 
one group had unconsciously                                   and felt 
less of a need to pay the debts of their sins. The people in the 
study connected their hand washing with all the ideas of 
cleanliness associated with the act, and then those associations 
influenced their behavior.

33. Some people believe that you can’t change human nature, 
and thus they see the idea of an evolving human consciousness 
as no more than unwarranted idealism. Yet, what is human 
nature? The dictionary defines nature as the inherent character 
or basic constitution of a person or thing — its essence. But 
does the inherent character and essence of a person ever 
change? We can gain insight into this key issue by asking an 
analogous question: Does the inherent character of a seed 
change when it grows into a tree? Not at all. The potential for 
becoming a tree was always resident within the seed. When a 
seed grows into a tree, it represents only a change in the 
degree to which its potential, always inherent in its original 
nature, is realized. Similarly, human nature does not change; 
yet, like the seed with the potential of becoming a tree, human 
nature is                                                                       . 
We human beings can grow from a primitive to an enlightened 
condition without a change in our basic human nature. [3점]

② not a static thing but a spectrum of potentials 
③ fertile soil with the potential to nurture creativity 
④ a stepping stone as well as a handicap to the future 
⑤ the result of interaction between mankind and nature    
as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills 
a negotiator can possess. It is not enough to know that they 
see things differently. If you want to influence them, you 
also need to understand empathetically the power of their 
point of view and to feel the emotional force with which 
they believe in it. It is not enough to study them like 
beetles under a microscope; you need to know                
. To accomplish this 
task you should be prepared to withhold judgment for a while 
as you “try on” their views. They may well believe that their 
views are right as strongly as you believe yours are. You 
may see on the table a glass half full of cool water. Your 
spouse may see a dirty, half-empty glass about to cause a 
mark on the expensive furniture.

being used. When an airplane with 200 seats is about to take 
off with 180 passengers on board, the cost of letting 20 
standby passengers get on the flight is negligible. That is

people flying on the same plane. Some passengers bought 
guaranteed reservations and others essentially bought a 
chance of getting on board as standbys. Different levels of 
probability have different costs in airline tickets, as 
elsewhere. The passengers themselves also differ in how

Like any other organ or system in the body, bone becomes 
stronger when it is stressed regularly, and it becomes weak 40
when it is not used enough. ① In this case, “stressed” means 
loaded through impact and tension, as occurs during running. 
② For the best explanation of bones becoming weak, take a 
look at astronauts. ③ Their bones are unloaded and not used 
much during lengthy stays in the zero-gravity environment of 
space. ④ As people age, the body starts to reabsorb calcium 
from the bones, leading to loss of bone mass. ⑤ When they 
arrive back on Earth, their bones are often so weak that they 
can barely support the astronaut’s body weight.

Leaders, on the other hand, don’t care very much for 
organizational structure or the official blessing of whatever 
factory they work for. 
If leadership is the ability to create change your organization 
believes in, and the market demands change, then the market 
demands leaders, not managers. ( ① ) Managers manage by 
using the authority the factory gives them, and you listen to your 
manager to avoid losing your job. ( ② ) A manager can’t make 
change because that’s not his job; his job is to complete tasks 
assigned to him by someone else in the factory. ( ③ ) They use 
passion and ideas to lead people, as opposed to using threats and 
bureaucracy to manage them. ( ④ ) Leaders must become 
aware of how the organization works, because this awareness 
allows them to change it. ( ⑤ ) Leadership doesn’t always start ①③
at the top, but it always manages to affect the folks at the top.  ⑤
  Surely since we all have the same visual equipment, we all

turns out that color vision isn’t a black-and-white issue. It’s 
not nearly that simple.   
(A) However, the number of differently labeled segments we use 
varies. Some languages only distinguish between two basic 
colors, black and white. Others add green, yellow, blue, and 
brown. 
(B) Language has a significant effect on how we “see” colors
― more precisely, on how we divide up and label different

Social neuroscientist John Cacioppo conducted a brain 
imaging study to identify differences in the neural mechanisms 
of lonely and non-lonely people. Specifically, he wanted to 
know what’s going on in the brains of individuals with an acute 
sense of loneliness. While in an MRI machine, subjects viewed 
a series of images, some with positive associations, such as 
happy people doing fun things, and others with negative 
associations, such as scenes of people in dispute. As the two 
groups watched pleasant imagery, the area of the brain that 
recognizes rewards showed a significantly greater response in 
non-lonely people than in lonely people. Similarly, the visual 
cortex of lonely subjects responded much more strongly to 
unpleasant images of people than to unpleasant images of 
objects ―suggesting that the attention of lonely people is 
especially drawn to discord among people. Non-lonely 
subjects showed no such difference.

what, where, and when to study. Another made similar plans, 
only month by month instead of day by day. And the third 
group, the controls, did not make plans. The researchers 
predicted that the day-by-day plans would work best. But 
they were wrong. The monthly planning group did the best in 
terms of improvements in study habits and attitudes. 
Monthly planners also kept it up much longer than the daily 
planners, and the continued planning thus was more likely to 
carry over into their work after the program ended. 
Why? Daily plans do have the advantage of letting the 
person know exactly what he or she should be doing at each 
moment. But their preparation is time-consuming, because it 
takes much longer to make thirty daily plans than a broad plan 
for the month without any daily details. Another drawback of 
daily plans is that they lack flexibility. They deprive the 
person of the chance to make choices along the way, so the 
person feels locked into a rigid and grinding sequence of tasks. 
Life rarely goes exactly according to plan, and so the daily 
plans can be demoralizing as soon as you fall off schedule. 
With a monthly plan, you can make                    . If a delay 
arises one day, your plan is still intact.

[43 ~ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. 45
(A)
At a high school in Utah, the administration organized a 
mentor program that teamed up one special-needs student 
with a mainstream student who would help him or her along. 
The football coach presented the idea to John, the captain of 
the team. John was a tall, strong, intense young man ― not 
the caring type needed for this kind of program. He made it 
clear that this “wasn’t his thing” and (a) he didn’t have time 
to be a mentor. 
  At the end of the football season, the team won the state 
championship, and John was awarded with a gold medal as 
the Most Valuable Player in the state. Randy was presented 
with a football team jacket. The team cheered as Randy put 
it on. It was the coolest thing that had ever happened to 
him. From that day forward, (b) he never took it off. He 
slept in his jacket and wore it throughout each weekend.
(C)
The coach knew it would be good for John and insisted that 
(c) he volunteer. John was matched up with Randy, one of the 
mentees in the program. Reluctant and irritated at first, he 
literally tried to “lose” Randy, but soon John welcomed the 
constant company. Randy not only attended every one of 
(d) his classes and ate with him at lunchtime, he also went 
to football practice. After a few days, John asked the coach to 
make Randy the official manager responsible for the balls, 
tape, and water bottles. 
(D)
After the big win the two were inseparable. Not only did John 
take Randy to special occasions like dances but he also took 
Randy to the library to tutor him. As he tutored Randy, John 
became a much better student and made the honor roll for the 
first time. The mentor program turned out to be one of the most 
rewarding experiences of (e) his life. John went to college on a 
full athletic scholarship and graduated with a master’s degree 
in education. Today John is a special education teacher and 
volunteers ten hours a week for the Special Olympics.
