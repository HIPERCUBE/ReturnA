33. Some people believe that you can’t change human nature, 
and thus they see the idea of an evolving human consciousness 
as no more than unwarranted idealism. Yet, what is human 
nature? The dictionary defines nature as the inherent character 
or basic constitution of a person or thing — its essence. But 
does the inherent character and essence of a person ever 
change? We can gain insight into this key issue by asking an 
analogous question: Does the inherent character of a seed 
change when it grows into a tree? Not at all. The potential for 
becoming a tree was always resident within the seed. When a 
seed grows into a tree, it represents only a change in the 
degree to which its potential, always inherent in its original 
nature, is realized. Similarly, human nature does not change; 
yet, like the seed with the potential of becoming a tree, human 
nature is                                                                       . 
We human beings can grow from a primitive to an enlightened 
condition without a change in our basic human nature. [3점]
