33. Some people believe that you can’t change human nature, 
and thus they see the idea of an evolving human consciousness 
as no more than unwarranted idealism. Yet, what is human 
nature? The dictionary defines nature as the inherent character 
or basic constitution of a person or thing — its essence. But 
does the inherent character and essence of a person ever 
change? We can gain insight into this key issue by asking an 
analogous question: Does the inherent character of a seed 
change when it grows into a tree? Not at all. The potential for 
becoming a tree was always resident within the seed. When a 
seed grows into a tree, it represents only a change in the 
degree to which its potential, always inherent in its original 
nature, is realized. Similarly, human nature does not change; 
yet, like the seed with the potential of becoming a tree, human 
nature is                                                                       . 
We human beings can grow from a primitive to an enlightened 
condition without a change in our basic human nature. [3점]

. The ability to see the situation as the other side sees it, 
as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills 
a negotiator can possess. It is not enough to know that they 
see things differently. If you want to influence them, you 
also need to understand empathetically the power of their 
point of view and to feel the emotional force with which 
they believe in it. It is not enough to study them like 
beetles under a microscope; you need to know                
. To accomplish this 
task you should be prepared to withhold judgment for a while 
as you “try on” their views. They may well believe that their 
views are right as strongly as you believe yours are. You 
may see on the table a glass half full of cool water. Your 
spouse may see a dirty, half-empty glass about to cause a 
mark on the expensive furniture.

. Costs vary not only with the volume of output, and to 
varying degrees from one industry to another, they also vary 
according to the extent to which existing     (A)     is 
being used. When an airplane with 200 seats is about to take 
off with 180 passengers on board, the cost of letting 20 
standby passengers get on the flight is negligible. That is 
one reason for radically different prices being charged to 
people flying on the same plane. Some passengers bought 
guaranteed reservations and others essentially bought a 
chance of getting on board as standbys. Different levels of 
probability have different costs in airline tickets, as 
elsewhere. The passengers themselves also differ in how 
important it is for them to be at a particular place at a 
particular time. Those on urgent business may want a 
guaranteed reservation, even at a higher price, while others 
may be in a position where     (B)     money is more 
important than being on one particular flight rather than 
another. [3점]

36. A snack with the label “99% natural” seems more appealing 39
than it would if labeled “1% unnatural.” A frozen dinner labeled 
“75% fat free” would sell better than it would with the label 
“25% fat.” The less appealing labeling option is just as accurate 
as the more appealing option. It also makes us reflect more 
about what we might be eating. (A) , bets sound less    
appealing when framed in terms of the chances of losing or the 
amount of money one might lose, rather than the chances of 
winning or the amount of money one would win. Medical 
procedures may sound scarier when presented in terms of the 
risk of dying, rather than the likelihood of coming through 
unharmed. (B) , it is a useful exercise to recompute

Like any other organ or system in the body, bone becomes 
stronger when it is stressed regularly, and it becomes weak 40
when it is not used enough. ① In this case, “stressed” means 
loaded through impact and tension, as occurs during running. 
② For the best explanation of bones becoming weak, take a 
look at astronauts. ③ Their bones are unloaded and not used 
much during lengthy stays in the zero-gravity environment of 
space. ④ As people age, the body starts to reabsorb calcium 
from the bones, leading to loss of bone mass. ⑤ When they 
arrive back on Earth, their bones are often so weak that they 
can barely support the astronaut’s body weight.

Leaders, on the other hand, don’t care very much for 
organizational structure or the official blessing of whatever 
factory they work for. 
If leadership is the ability to create change your organization 
believes in, and the market demands change, then the market 
demands leaders, not managers. ( ① ) Managers manage by 
using the authority the factory gives them, and you listen to your 
manager to avoid losing your job. ( ② ) A manager can’t make 
change because that’s not his job; his job is to complete tasks 
assigned to him by someone else in the factory. ( ③ ) They use 
passion and ideas to lead people, as opposed to using threats and 
bureaucracy to manage them. ( ④ ) Leaders must become 
aware of how the organization works, because this awareness 
allows them to change it. ( ⑤ ) Leadership doesn’t always start ①③
at the top, but it always manages to affect the folks at the top.  ⑤

Surely since we all have the same visual equipment, we all 
see something as basic as color in the same way? Wrong. It 
turns out that color vision isn’t a black-and-white issue. It’s 
not nearly that simple.   
(A) However, the number of differently labeled segments we use 
varies. Some languages only distinguish between two basic 
colors, black and white. Others add green, yellow, blue, and 
brown. 
(B) Language has a significant effect on how we “see” colors
― more precisely, on how we divide up and label different 
parts of the visible spectrum. Our eyes register roughly 
the same range of light between the aptly named infrared 
and ultraviolet. 
(C) This sort of different color categorization is nicely 
illustrated by the word “grue.” Psychologists use it to 
describe languages that make no distinction between 
green and blue.

Social neuroscientist John Cacioppo conducted a brain 
imaging study to identify differences in the neural mechanisms 
of lonely and non-lonely people. Specifically, he wanted to 
know what’s going on in the brains of individuals with an acute 
sense of loneliness. While in an MRI machine, subjects viewed 
a series of images, some with positive associations, such as 
happy people doing fun things, and others with negative 
associations, such as scenes of people in dispute. As the two 
groups watched pleasant imagery, the area of the brain that 
recognizes rewards showed a significantly greater response in 
non-lonely people than in lonely people. Similarly, the visual 
cortex of lonely subjects responded much more strongly to 
unpleasant images of people than to unpleasant images of 
objects ―suggesting that the attention of lonely people is 
especially drawn to discord among people. Non-lonely 
subjects showed no such difference.

(A)
At a high school in Utah, the administration organized a 
mentor program that teamed up one special-needs student 
with a mainstream student who would help him or her along. 
The football coach presented the idea to John, the captain of 
the team. John was a tall, strong, intense young man ― not 
the caring type needed for this kind of program. He made it 
clear that this “wasn’t his thing” and (a) he didn’t have time 
to be a mentor. 
(B)
At the end of the football season, the team won the state 
championship, and John was awarded with a gold medal as 
the Most Valuable Player in the state. Randy was presented 
with a football team jacket. The team cheered as Randy put 
it on. It was the coolest thing that had ever happened to 
him. From that day forward, (b) he never took it off. He 
slept in his jacket and wore it throughout each weekend.
(C)
The coach knew it would be good for John and insisted that 
(c) he volunteer. John was matched up with Randy, one of the 
mentees in the program. Reluctant and irritated at first, he 
literally tried to “lose” Randy, but soon John welcomed the 
constant company. Randy not only attended every one of 
(d) his classes and ate with him at lunchtime, he also went 
to football practice. After a few days, John asked the coach to 
make Randy the official manager responsible for the balls, 
tape, and water bottles. 
(D)
After the big win the two were inseparable. Not only did John 
take Randy to special occasions like dances but he also took 
Randy to the library to tutor him. As he tutored Randy, John 
became a much better student and made the honor roll for the 
first time. The mentor program turned out to be one of the most 
rewarding experiences of (e) his life. John went to college on a 
full athletic scholarship and graduated with a master’s degree 
in education. Today John is a special education teacher and 
volunteers ten hours a week for the Special Olympics.
