32. A great example of how potent a force your unconscious can 34
be was detailed by researchers in a 2006 paper published in the 
journal Science. They conducted a study in which people were 
asked to remember a terrible sin from their past, something they 
had done which was unethical. The researchers asked them to 
describe how the memory made them feel. They then offered 
half of the participants the opportunity to wash their hands. At 
the end of the study, they asked subjects if they would be 
willing to take part in later research for no pay as a favor to a 
desperate graduate student. Those who did not wash their hands 
agreed to help 74 percent of the time, but those who did wash 
agreed only 41 percent of the time. According to the researchers, 
one group had unconsciously                                   and felt 
less of a need to pay the debts of their sins. The people in the 
study connected their hand washing with all the ideas of 
cleanliness associated with the act, and then those associations 
influenced their behavior.
