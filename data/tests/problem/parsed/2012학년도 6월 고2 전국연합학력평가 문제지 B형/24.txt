In Philadelphia, planners have been experimenting with a new
way of slowing drivers down: painted 3­D triangles ① that
look like speed bumps. At one quarter of the cost of physical
bumps, the devices also have the advantage of not tearing
up emergency vehicle axles as they speed over ② them. A
month of investigation on a half­mile stretch of road found
that driver speeds ③ fell from an average of 38 miles per
hour to 23 miles per hour. While this drop is impressive,
the effect may be temporary as drivers, particularly those
who regularly travel that route, ④ to learn which bumps are
just illusions. Still, ⑤ slowing down the tourists might
provide enough benefit to be worth the cost.
