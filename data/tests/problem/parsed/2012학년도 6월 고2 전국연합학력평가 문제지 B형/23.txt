There is a need out here that your station could fill. Ask
yourself, “What is more widely found in homes and offices
than even computers or TVs?” Answer: the potted plant. But
are these plants healthy and growing? Many times not. I
think a weekly evening program on basic indoor plant care
would be a big hit with your listeners. Rather than
overwhelm your audience with agricultural information, take
a light approach to the subject. Put some fun into describing
plants and plant care. The program could touch on
little­known topics like the effect of office music or
electromagnetic fields on plants. You could even have a
call­in segment for people to ask questions and share their
experiences. Doesn’t this sound like a winner? I think so.
