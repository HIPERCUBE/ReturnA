A year after the Flip Video camcorders hit the market,
they had a 13 percent market share. They got that market
share with a product that did almost nothing compared to its
competitors. It only had a 2x zoom. It had only three
buttons― one to record and stop recording, one to play
video, and one to trash video. It wasn’t HD at the time. You
couldn’t take pictures with it. So, what made it so
successful? The Flip was simple. Your mastery was almost
immediate, and so was your sense of pride and happiness.
While it had a simple solution, that didn’t mean that
underlying technology was simple or that the underlying
business model was simple. It just meant that the experience
for the customer was simple. And people loved that.
