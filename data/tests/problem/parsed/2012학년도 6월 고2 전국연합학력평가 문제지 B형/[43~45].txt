(A)
One day Howard Kelly, a poor boy, who was selling
goods from door to door to pay his way through school,
found he had only one thin dime left, and he was
hungry. He decided he would ask for a meal at the next
house. However, he lost his nerve when Grace, a lovely
young woman, opened the door. Instead of a meal he
asked for a drink of water.
(B)
Years later Grace became critically ill. Her doctor was
baffled. (a) He finally sent her to the big city, where
they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr.
Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When
he heard the name of the town she came from, a
strange light filled his eyes. Immediately (b) he rose and
went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed
in his doctor’s gown he went in to see her. He
recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation
room determined to do his best to save her life. From
that day on he gave special attention to the case.

(C)
She thought (c) he looked hungry, so she brought him
a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly, and then
asked, “How much do I owe you?” “You don’t owe me
anything. Mother has taught us never to accept pay for
an act of kindness,” she replied. “Then I thank you from
the bottom of my heart,” he said. As Howard Kelly left
that house, (d) he not only felt stronger physically, but
his faith in man was stronger.
(D)
After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly
requested the business office to pass Grace’s final bill to
him for approval. (e) He looked at it, then wrote
something on the edge and the bill was sent to her
room. She feared to open it, for she was sure it would
take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally she
looked, and something caught her attention on the side
of the bill. She began to read the following words: “Paid
in full with one glass of milk. Dr. Howard Kelly.”
