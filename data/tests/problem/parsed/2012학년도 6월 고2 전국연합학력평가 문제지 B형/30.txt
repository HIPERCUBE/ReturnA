30. Males and females compete for many of the same reasons
― to achieve leadership positions or feel good about their
abilities. In addition, both males and females tend to be more
motivated to win when they play on a team, compared to
when they play individually. There is a difference, though. In
one experiment, college students were asked to solve computer
maze puzzles. First, they solved the puzzles alone, without
any comparison of their results. Then the students were
asked to compete against each other in a tournament. The
men’s performance improved substantially when they were in
competition, but the women’s performance did not change from
when they were playing alone. The conclusion researchers made
was that, in general, .
① females are less interested in computer games than males
② playing on a team or alone doesn’t make any difference
③ females are not as motivated by competition as males
④ encouraging, not comparing, makes more desirable results
⑤ males are more cooperative than females in a tournament
