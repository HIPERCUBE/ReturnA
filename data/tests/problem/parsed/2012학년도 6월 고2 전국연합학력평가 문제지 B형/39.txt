But there is more and more evidence that some animals
use symbolic tools in much the same way.
Symbolic tool use is something people do every time they
pay for an item with paper bills or coins.　 Some monkeys
and apes in captivity have learned to use tokens that they
trade for various foods. (① )　But Robert W. Shumaker, the
author of Orangutans, is more interested in the sort of
symbolic tools that can affect emotions. (② )　Children often
have a special stuffed animal or blanket that is much more
than a toy;　 the object represents comfort or security to
them, and they use it to feel better.　(③ ) This behavior of
children is what scientists once considered uniquely human.
(④ )　 Shumaker would see great apes in times of great
stress or sadness, like a female who had an infant that died.
(⑤ ) “That female would create something that researchers
called a doll and then treat it exactly as she had treated her
infant that had recently died,” he says.
