A visit to New Orleans tells us how profoundly people can
react to price signals. New Orleans displays a unique
architectural style― the “Camelback” house― based on
avoiding tax. In the late nineteenth century, houses were
taxed based on the number of stories at the front, so the
Camelback design had one story at the front and more at
the back. They look charming, but it is not a practical
design for a house and hasn’t caught on elsewhere. There is a
similar story in Britain, which is full of dingy houses in
response to the policy, in effect from 1696 to 1851, of taxing
people based on the number of windows their homes had.
