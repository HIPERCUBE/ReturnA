33. One summer a teenager I knew, a young man who had the 
highest IQ ever recorded by the local school system, 
repainted a neighbor’s roof. He climbed up with his paint 
bucket and roller and started to paint ― from the bottom to 
the top. When he got to the highest point of the roof, he 
realized he was in trouble. On the way down, he slipped on 
the fresh paint, fell off the roof, and broke his leg. He was 
very good at math and reading, but he couldn’t think of the 
idea of starting from the top. Sometimes common sense and 
practical know­how are more useful than                   .
