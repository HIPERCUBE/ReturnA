Suppose you come home from school to find a cushion 
torn apart on the living room floor.
(A) As she jumps into your arms, you find that she is 
covered with pieces of the cushion’s stuffing. You know 
that you were the last person to leave that morning.
(B) The stuffing has been pulled out, and small pieces of it 
are everywhere. As you set down your backpack, your 
dog runs toward you.

possible explanation, based on the facts, that she tore 
apart the cushion. This process is called drawing a 
conclusion.
