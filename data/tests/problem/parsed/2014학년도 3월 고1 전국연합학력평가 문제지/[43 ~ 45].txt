(A)
My son, Justin, was five years old and this was his 
first Easter Egg Hunt. All the children gathered behind 
the starting line, a yellow ribbon, waiting to begin. When 
the ribbon was cut, they all started running, except for 
Justin. “Run,” I shouted, “run, Justin, hurry.” But (a) he 
paid no attention to me.

(B)
Then I saw Justin bend over and it looked like (b) he 
had found an egg. He turned and waved his hand at me. 
Then once more he picked up something. Within five 
minutes, all the eggs seemed to have been found and the 
children were heading back to the starting line to show 
their mothers what they had found. Some had one egg, 
some had two, and a few even had three.
(C)
He was about one hundred feet behind the rest of the 
kids who were racing madly, looking for the hidden eggs. 
“Oh, (c) he won’t get a thing,” I said to my sister who 
was standing beside me. Her son, Danny, was one of the 
first of the children to be at the head. (d) He was 
running quickly with other children.
(D)
At that time I saw Justin heading my way. (e) His bag 
was full! When he opened it, we counted twelve eggs! 
All the other children, in their haste, had run right past 
these eggs, but not Justin. He had just slowly walked 
along picking up the eggs the other children had run 
past. Sometimes, I learned then, our kids do better when 
we don’t push them hard.
