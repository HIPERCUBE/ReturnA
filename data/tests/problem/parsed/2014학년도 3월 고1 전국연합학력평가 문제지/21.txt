You would think all bicycles must have brakes. But the 
bicycles used for track racing are built without brakes. A 
track racing bicycle has only essential parts to keep its 
weight down. So, how do you stop it? This is where the 
gloves come in. The racer backpedals, and then holds the 
front wheel tight with his hands. This stops the wheel from 
spinning, and the bicycle comes to a stop. No wonder track 
bicycle racers wear gloves! If they didn’t, their hands would 
get terribly hurt every time they tried to stop.
