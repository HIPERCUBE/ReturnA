Early native Americans had to make everything they 
needed. ① The kinds of things each tribe used to make 
tools, clothing, toys, shelter, and food depended upon what 
they found around them. ② Also, the things they made fit 
their life style. ③ Most tribes spoke their own language, but 
could communicate with other tribes. ④ For example, the 
people of the Plains, who traveled a lot, didn’t make clay 
pots. ⑤ Pots were too heavy and broke too easily when 
they were moved, so they made containers from animal 
skins.
