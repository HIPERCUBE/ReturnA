I once watched Grandfather looking at a bush. He 
stood for half an hour, silent and still. As I got closer, I 
could see he was looking at a sort of bird, but I could 
not tell what kind of bird it was. Just as I was about to 
ask him, a common robin flew from the bush. I asked 
Grandfather what he was looking at. Smiling, he replied, 
“A robin.” I said, “But Grandfather, it’s just a common 
robin. What’s so interesting about a robin?” He said, 
“Just a robin?” Then, he drew a picture of a bird on the 
ground with a stick and, handing me the stick, he said, 
“Show me where all the black marks on a robin are 
located.” I said, “I don’t know.” “Then,” he continued, 
“each bird is as                 as you and I. No single 
bird is the same as another. We can always learn 
something new every time we observe a robin. That is 
also true of everything else in life, every experience, 
every situation, every bird, tree, rock, water, and leaf. 
We can never know enough about anything. Finally,” he 
continued, “you do not even begin to know an animal 
until you touch it, and feel its spirit. Then and only then 
can you ever begin to know.”
