Good news for book lovers!
Here’s a good website for all of you. It’s called 
Easy Books. Its service is very easy to use. You just 
look through the online catalog, select your books, and 
wait for them to arrive. The door­to­door delivery 
service is very convenient for people who don’t have 
time to go to the library. You can enjoy reading new 
books without stepping out of your home. Also the 
price is quite good. With only 10 dollars a month, you 
can borrow up to five books at a time. What’s better, 
you can keep the books as long as you want with no 
late fee. Join it, and you’ll love it.
