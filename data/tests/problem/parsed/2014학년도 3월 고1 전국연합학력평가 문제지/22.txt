When Mom decided to marry Dad, her father didn’t like 
him. Dad was a painter from a poor family and ① he had no 
background to speak of. The important thing, Mom has told 
me, is that she knew she and ② he were soul mates. 
Nothing was going to stop her from spending the rest of her 
life with ③ him. So they got married and settled in 
Millerton, and my grandfather decided ④ he could put up 
with Dad. When Dad couldn’t quite make a living with ⑤ his 
paintings, he and Mom bought an old house on Grant Avenue 
and turned it into a boarding house.
