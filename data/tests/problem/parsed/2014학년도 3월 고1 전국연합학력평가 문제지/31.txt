31. Everyone knows that dogs make wonderful pets. But many 
dogs also have different              . Some dogs, for 
example, are used by the police. Often these dogs help 
people in trouble or find people who are lost. Other dogs 
work at airports. They sniff out plants, food, and other 
things that people are not supposed to bring in from other 
countries. With their help, these things are found and never 
enter the country. Some other dogs help people keep their 
homes safe from harmful insects. Once the dogs find the 
insect nest with their sharp nose, people can have the 
insects and their nest removed.
