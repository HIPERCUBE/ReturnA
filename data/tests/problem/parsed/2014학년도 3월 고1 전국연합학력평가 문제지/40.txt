Most people think their conscious minds control 
everything they do. They generally believe the conscious 
mind constantly directs their actions. These beliefs are 
false. Consider walking, for example, which is something 
that most people do over and over all day long. Do you 
consciously control the movements of your legs and 
feet? Does your conscious mind have to say, “Now pick 
up the left foot, swing it forward, hold it high enough so 
it doesn’t touch the ground, set down the heel, roll 
forward, shift weight off the back foot,” and so on? Of 
course not. Most of the time, walking is done without 
conscious thoughts or intentions.
