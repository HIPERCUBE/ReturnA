Several animal species help other injured animals survive. 
Dolphins need to reach the surface of the water to breathe. 
If a dolphin is wounded so severely that it cannot swim to 
the surface by itself, other dolphins group themselves under 
it, pushing it upward to the air. If necessary, they will keep 
doing this for several hours. The same kind of thing happens 
among elephants. A fallen elephant is likely to have 
difficulty breathing because of its own weight, or it may 
overheat in the sun. Many elephant experts have reported 
that when an elephant falls down, other members of the 
group try to raise it to its feet.
