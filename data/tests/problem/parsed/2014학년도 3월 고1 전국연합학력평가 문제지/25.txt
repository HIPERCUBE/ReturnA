It’s a small world, and business brings people from all 
cultures together. You may attend a meeting with a ① foreign 
visitor, or you may be sent off to a country with a language 
you don’t understand. A language ② gap is a great 
opportunity for good manners to shine. The best course of 
action is a little ③ preparation. You can obtain a phrase book 
and learn a few ④ basic expressions - “Good morning,” 
“Please,” “Thank you,” “I’m pleased to meet you,” and 
“Goodbye.” Making an effort to communicate in another 
person’s language shows your ⑤ disrespect for that person.
