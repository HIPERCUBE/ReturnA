19. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
It is very important to help poor countries, but it’s not 
simple. We should be giving money or food directly to the 
poor in emergencies like an earthquake or flood. In less 
emergent situations, however, providing food can make 
people dependent. If a developed country gives food to a 
poor country, its local farmers will find it difficult to 
produce food to sell. We need to help poor people to earn 
their own money, or to produce their own food. Just giving 
them money or food is not a good idea. We have to find a 
way to help them stand on their own two feet.
① 가난한 나라의 경제적 자립을 도와야 한다.
② 국가 간의 빈부 격차를 긴급히 해소해야 한다. 
③ 수입 농산물에 대한 엄격한 검사를 실시해야 한다.
④ 자연재해에 대비한 긴급 구조 체계를 확립해야 한다.
⑤ 지역에서 생산된 농산물의 직거래를 활성화해야 한다.
20. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Several animal species help other injured animals survive. 
Dolphins need to reach the surface of the water to breathe. 
If a dolphin is wounded so severely that it cannot swim to 
the surface by itself, other dolphins group themselves under 
it, pushing it upward to the air. If necessary, they will keep 
doing this for several hours. The same kind of thing happens 
among elephants. A fallen elephant is likely to have 
difficulty breathing because of its own weight, or it may 
overheat in the sun. Many elephant experts have reported 
that when an elephant falls down, other members of the 
group try to raise it to its feet.
① 멸종 위기에 처한 동물
② 야생동물 구조의 어려움
③ 동료를 돕는 동물의 습성

21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
You would think all bicycles must have brakes. But the 
bicycles used for track racing are built without brakes. A 
track racing bicycle has only essential parts to keep its 
weight down. So, how do you stop it? This is where the 
gloves come in. The racer backpedals, and then holds the 
front wheel tight with his hands. This stops the wheel from 
spinning, and the bicycle comes to a stop. No wonder track 
bicycle racers wear gloves! If they didn’t, their hands would 
get terribly hurt every time they tried to stop.

him. Dad was a painter from a poor family and ① he had no 
background to speak of. The important thing, Mom has told 
me, is that she knew she and ② he were soul mates. 
Nothing was going to stop her from spending the rest of her 
life with ③ him. So they got married and settled in 
Millerton, and my grandfather decided ④ he could put up 
with Dad. When Dad couldn’t quite make a living with ⑤ his 
paintings, he and Mom bought an old house on Grant Avenue 
and turned it into a boarding house.

It’s important to remember that good decisions can still 
lead to bad outcomes. Here is an example. Soon after I got 
out of school, I ① was offered a job. I wasn’t sure that was 
a great fit for me. After carefully considering the 
opportunity, I decided to ② turn it down. I thought that I 
would be able to find another job ③ what was a better 
match. Unfortunately, the economy soon grew worse quickly 
and I spent months ④ looking for another job. I kicked 
myself for ⑤ not taking that position, which started to look 
more and more appealing. I had made a good decision, based 
upon all the information I had at the time, but in the short 
run it didn’t lead to a great outcome.

25. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지

It’s a small world, and business brings people from all 
cultures together. You may attend a meeting with a ① foreign 
visitor, or you may be sent off to a country with a language 
you don’t understand. A language ② gap is a great 
opportunity for good manners to shine. The best course of 
action is a little ③ preparation. You can obtain a phrase book 
and learn a few ④ basic expressions - “Good morning,” 
“Please,” “Thank you,” “I’m pleased to meet you,” and 
“Goodbye.” Making an effort to communicate in another 
person’s language shows your ⑤ disrespect for that person.

28. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
My twelve­year­old son and I were returning home after a 
trip. When we entered the side door leading to the kitchen, I 
immediately knew that something was wrong. Before I could 
turn on the light, I realized the house was incredibly cold. On 
turning on the switch, I found that everything was out of 
order. The window above the sink was broken, and hundreds 
of pieces of glass made a mess on my kitchen floor. My legs 
were trembling so badly that I could hardly stand still. I held 
my son by the arm and whispered, “Someone broke in and 
might still be inside.” We ran to a neighbor’s.

The warthog is a member of the pig family. This animal 
can be found only in Africa. Unlike most animals, warthogs 
can survive in dry areas without drinking water for several 
months. Warthogs can reach 4 to 6 feet in length and 
between 110 and 260 pounds in weight. Males are 20 to 50 
pounds heavier than females.　 Warthogs keep their tails in 
the upright position when they are running. In that position, 
their tails look like flags in the wind.　Warthogs have poor 
eyesight, but excellent senses of smell and hearing.

31. Everyone knows that dogs make wonderful pets. But many 
dogs also have different              . Some dogs, for 
example, are used by the police. Often these dogs help 
people in trouble or find people who are lost. Other dogs 
work at airports. They sniff out plants, food, and other 
things that people are not supposed to bring in from other 
countries. With their help, these things are found and never 
enter the country. Some other dogs help people keep their 
homes safe from harmful insects. Once the dogs find the 
insect nest with their sharp nose, people can have the 
insects and their nest removed.

32. Today, 3­D printing technology is used only in companies 
and universities, but the prices are now getting lower and 
the quality better. We can imagine every home having a 3­D 
printer in the future. Note that 3­D printing technology 
doesn’t require an original object to copy: any drawing will 
do, as long as it describes the piece precisely. Soon anyone 
can use a home sketching tool to produce the proper design, 
and then the home printer will be able to create the actual 
physical object. If you can               it, you can make 
it. For example, if you don’t have enough dinner plates for 
your guests, you can “print out” some real plates from your 
sketch.
① mix ② open ③ draw
④ move ⑤ taste
33. One summer a teenager I knew, a young man who had the 
highest IQ ever recorded by the local school system, 
repainted a neighbor’s roof. He climbed up with his paint 
bucket and roller and started to paint ― from the bottom to 
the top. When he got to the highest point of the roof, he 
realized he was in trouble. On the way down, he slipped on 
the fresh paint, fell off the roof, and broke his leg. He was 
very good at math and reading, but he couldn’t think of the 
idea of starting from the top. Sometimes common sense and 
practical know­how are more useful than                   .

34. Tom was a professional basketball player. In his last 
championship game, his mistake caused his team to lose the 
game. For years after his retirement, he kept thinking about 
the mistake. When people asked, “Why are you depressed 
most of the time?” he answered, “I was a fool to make such 
a mistake. How else do you expect me to feel?” Even if 
people told him that it was his thinking that was depressing 
him, he would say, “No, it isn’t. I’m depressed because I 
made the mistake, not because I’m thinking about it. In fact, 
I seldom think about it.” Tom didn’t see his thinking as

35. One of the most important skills you can develop in 
human relations is the ability to                      . It’s 
one of the keys to satisfying customers, maintaining a 
marriage, and raising children. All human interactions are 
improved by the ability to put yourself in another person’s 
shoes. How? Look beyond yourself, your own interests, and 
your own world. When you work to examine a problem in 
the light of another’s history and discover the interests and 
concerns of others, you begin to see what others see. And 
that is a powerful thing. [3점]

② forgive others’ mistakes
③ know what you really want
④ express your feelings honestly 
⑤ see things from others’ points of view

embarrassing if it’s done when a teenager is with his 
friends. It may cause the teenager to push the parent away 
or say, “Stop it.”    (B)   , massaging the teenager’s

Instead it takes in air through its skin and an opening

A turtle doesn’t have automatic body temperature control

it digs a hole deep into the mud at the bottom of a pond or

Early native Americans had to make everything they 
needed. ① The kinds of things each tribe used to make 
tools, clothing, toys, shelter, and food depended upon what 
they found around them. ② Also, the things they made fit 
their life style. ③ Most tribes spoke their own language, but 
could communicate with other tribes. ④ For example, the 
people of the Plains, who traveled a lot, didn’t make clay 
pots. ⑤ Pots were too heavy and broke too easily when 
they were moved, so they made containers from animal 
skins.

Most people think their conscious minds control 
everything they do. They generally believe the conscious 
mind constantly directs their actions. These beliefs are 
false. Consider walking, for example, which is something 
that most people do over and over all day long. Do you 
consciously control the movements of your legs and 
feet? Does your conscious mind have to say, “Now pick 
up the left foot, swing it forward, hold it high enough so 
it doesn’t touch the ground, set down the heel, roll 
forward, shift weight off the back foot,” and so on? Of 
course not. Most of the time, walking is done without 
conscious thoughts or intentions.

I once watched Grandfather looking at a bush. He 
stood for half an hour, silent and still. As I got closer, I 
could see he was looking at a sort of bird, but I could 
not tell what kind of bird it was. Just as I was about to 
ask him, a common robin flew from the bush. I asked 
Grandfather what he was looking at. Smiling, he replied, 
“A robin.” I said, “But Grandfather, it’s just a common 
robin. What’s so interesting about a robin?” He said, 
“Just a robin?” Then, he drew a picture of a bird on the 
ground with a stick and, handing me the stick, he said, 
“Show me where all the black marks on a robin are 
located.” I said, “I don’t know.” “Then,” he continued, 
“each bird is as                 as you and I. No single 
bird is the same as another. We can always learn 
something new every time we observe a robin. That is 
also true of everything else in life, every experience, 
every situation, every bird, tree, rock, water, and leaf. 
We can never know enough about anything. Finally,” he 
continued, “you do not even begin to know an animal 
until you touch it, and feel its spirit. Then and only then 
can you ever begin to know.”

My son, Justin, was five years old and this was his 
first Easter Egg Hunt. All the children gathered behind 
the starting line, a yellow ribbon, waiting to begin. When 
the ribbon was cut, they all started running, except for 
Justin. “Run,” I shouted, “run, Justin, hurry.” But (a) he 
paid no attention to me.
* Easter Egg Hunt: 부활절 달걀 찾기 행사
(B)
Then I saw Justin bend over and it looked like (b) he 
had found an egg. He turned and waved his hand at me. 
Then once more he picked up something. Within five 
minutes, all the eggs seemed to have been found and the 
children were heading back to the starting line to show 
their mothers what they had found. Some had one egg, 
some had two, and a few even had three.
(C)
He was about one hundred feet behind the rest of the 
kids who were racing madly, looking for the hidden eggs. 
“Oh, (c) he won’t get a thing,” I said to my sister who 
was standing beside me. Her son, Danny, was one of the 
first of the children to be at the head. (d) He was 
running quickly with other children.
(D)
At that time I saw Justin heading my way. (e) His bag 
was full! When he opened it, we counted twelve eggs! 
All the other children, in their haste, had run right past 
these eggs, but not Justin. He had just slowly walked 
along picking up the eggs the other children had run
