32. Today, 3­D printing technology is used only in companies 
and universities, but the prices are now getting lower and 
the quality better. We can imagine every home having a 3­D 
printer in the future. Note that 3­D printing technology 
doesn’t require an original object to copy: any drawing will 
do, as long as it describes the piece precisely. Soon anyone 
can use a home sketching tool to produce the proper design, 
and then the home printer will be able to create the actual 
physical object. If you can               it, you can make 
it. For example, if you don’t have enough dinner plates for 
your guests, you can “print out” some real plates from your 
sketch.
