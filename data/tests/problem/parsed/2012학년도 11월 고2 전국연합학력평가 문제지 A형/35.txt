35. In seeking goals, it is important to know about the 
“eleventh hour.” Have you ever noticed in life that things 
can look really gloomy just before a dramatic turn for the 
better? A successful businessman reports that just before 
he made his fortune, he was about to quit. He was up the 
creek without a paddle when, suddenly, everything began to 
fall into place. He held out to the end to get his payoff. 
Perhaps you have had this experience; when wondering if 
life was worth all the effort, you met somebody who made 
the dark clouds go away. Life is like that because there is 
a principle at work here ─ the “eleventh hour” principle. It 
is always darkest and coldest just before dawn. But if we   
, we will get our rewards. [3점]
