Mechanization was the key that unlocked the Industrial 
Revolution. In the ① pre-industrial period, manufacturing had 
been carried out by self-employed individuals in their homes, 
or in small workshops in which a craftsman oversaw the work 
of apprentices. Commonly, one person would undertake all the 
tasks ② involved in producing an item, from start to finish. 
However, the pioneering economist Adam Smith pointed out 
that this craft-based approach was ③ efficient. Taking the 
example of a pin factory, Smith said that one man working 
alone would ④ struggle to complete one pin a day, whereas if 
ten different workers each undertook one stage in the process, 
the factory might produce 48,000 pins a day. Such a ⑤ division 
of labour, Smith argued, also encouraged the development of 
new machinery.
