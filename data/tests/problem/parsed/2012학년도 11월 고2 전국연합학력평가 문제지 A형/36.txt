36. Ideas sometimes occur                                                   . 
This is how the idea for Harry Potter came to author J. K. 
Rowling. She was taking a long train journey from Manchester 
to London and the idea for Harry just fell into her head. 
Another recent example is Trevor Bayliss’s human-powered 
windup radio. This idea suddenly “hit” him after he had been 
watching a television program about the alarming spread of 
AIDS in Africa. The program had mentioned the problem of 
providing education to prevent the disease in isolated regions 
without electrical power. In an instant he realized that a windup 
radio could help to solve the problem. Straight away he went 
into his workshop and began working on the idea. [3점]
