23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Let’s say that you are training for a certain race and your 
schedule calls for a 10 percent increase in mileage this week, 
yet you’re feeling a little pain in your legs. How do you 
respond? Do you go ahead and follow the schedule, or do you 
change it? You know the right answer. Yet many runners insist 
on sticking to the printed training schedule, since they believe 
that any change will ruin their chances of running a good race. 
In fact, the opposite is true. You would benefit more by giving 
your body a chance to recover. Training schedules are built on 
the assumption that you aren’t experiencing any unusual pains 
before, during, or after the run. If pain or fatigue does strike, 
don’t hesitate to change your workouts. 
① 훈련 방법을 정기적으로 수정하라.
② 훈련 결과를 분석하여 계획을 수립하라.

⑤ 훈련을 점진적으로 강화하여 부상을 예방하라.

To Whom It May Concern: 
I bought a rice cooker about six months ago at 
Mincefield’s Department Store (Model 20-V, with a 
1-year warranty). When I tried to use it last week, 
however, the power button would not work. I tried to 
return the item to the store, but Mincefield’s would 
not honor the warranty, because it is going out of 
business. The manager suggested that I contact you, 
the manufacturer. So, I’m sending you the cooker with 
this letter. Please have the cooker repaired and return 
it to my work address: 2003 Mountainview, Houston, 
TX 79050. I use the cooker quite frequently so I would 
appreciate your promptness.
Sincerely,
S usan  T iffin

25. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Most of us learn not to rely on giving information orally 
because of all the mistakes that occur. The result is that we 
“memo” everything. Just look at your desk. Couldn’t some of 
that paperwork be eliminated by simply talking to another 
person? Yes, it could, if you could be sure that the other person 
knew how to listen. All of this unnecessary paperwork means 
that we need more word processors, use too much of our 
secretaries’ time, and require extra file cabinets to store all the 
notes we write down and get from others. We’re not going to 
magically eliminate the paperwork problem in organizations 
overnight. But we can improve the situation if we all work to 
become better listeners. 
① 메모하는 습관은 성공을 위한 지름길이다.
② 문서를 재활용할 때는 보안에 주의해야 한다. 
③ 업무 효율을 높이기 위해 정리정돈이 필요하다. 
④ 경청을 하면 불필요한 서류작업을 줄일 수 있다.  
⑤ 직원들의 복지 수준을 높이면 생산성이 향상된다. 
26. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Some people are especially sensitive about being properly 
addressed; others are more tolerant. In our casual world, we 
often overlook the fact that people have last names and titles. 
We can never assume that a person wishes to be addressed by 
their first name; to do so implies familiarity, which is not 
always appreciated. You may not know the person well, you 
may be mistakenly shortening their name, or you may be calling 
them by the wrong name altogether. To be on the conservative 
side, address a person with a title of Mrs., Ms., or Mr. until you 
are advised otherwise. Errors in using people’s names can spoil 
business dealings, particularly when working with individuals 
from cultural backgrounds with which you are not very familiar.

In the Paris subway system, users insert a paper card into a 
machine. The machine reads the card, leaves a record on the 
card that makes it “used,” and then (A) spit / spits  it out from 
the machine. The card has a magnetic strip on one side. On 
Matthew’s first visit to Paris, he was not sure how to use the 
system. So he tried putting the card in with the magnetic strip 
face up and was (B) pleased / pleasing to discover that it 
worked. He was careful thereafter to insert the card with the 
strip face up. During a later trip to Paris, he was proudly   
demonstrating to a friend the correct way to use the system 
when his wife started laughing. It turns out (C) that / what it 
doesn’t matter which way you put the card into the machine!

것은? [3점]
Mechanization was the key that unlocked the Industrial 
Revolution. In the ① pre-industrial period, manufacturing had 
been carried out by self-employed individuals in their homes, 
or in small workshops in which a craftsman oversaw the work 
of apprentices. Commonly, one person would undertake all the 
tasks ② involved in producing an item, from start to finish. 
However, the pioneering economist Adam Smith pointed out 
that this craft-based approach was ③ efficient. Taking the 
example of a pin factory, Smith said that one man working 
alone would ④ struggle to complete one pin a day, whereas if 
ten different workers each undertook one stage in the process, 
the factory might produce 48,000 pins a day. Such a ⑤ division 
of labour, Smith argued, also encouraged the development of 
new machinery.

33. 다음 글에서 할머니가 느꼈을 심경의 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Suddenly everyone was startled by the children running 
toward their grandmother, screaming and shouting in terror, “A 
bear! A bear!” The grandmother called to all the children to run 
as fast as possible for home. When the children had all started 
for home, the grandmother ran too. Shouting to the children not 
to stop running, she turned around and saw that the bear was 
very close to her. She soon realized that she could never outrun 
the animal. She must do something. Turning suddenly, she 
pointed an umbrella straight at the bear. To her surprise the 
bear stopped, though he still growled. The grandmother, seeing 
the bear’s fright, held the umbrella aimed at him, and to her 
great relief he turned around in the path and fled out of sight.
① happy → sorrowful ② frightened → relieved
③ surprised → depressed ④ nervous → disappointed
⑤ indifferent → delighted

34. Thinking is hard work. If you do not keep your working 
memory clear, then you are weakening your ability to think 
about what is going on in your class or meeting. This might 
seem obvious, but if you look around the room at many 
meetings, you will find yourself face-to-face with one of the 
true demons of modern life: multitasking. Sitting in a meeting, 
you will see that some people are taking care of work that is 
unrelated to the current meeting. Others are checking their 
e-mail. Still others are reading. Each of these activities takes 
up your working memory. You cannot maximize the quality of 
the new knowledge you are taking in if you do not give 
yourself every opportunity to                                  . [3점]
① pay attention ② share experiences
③ boost confidence  ④ assign responsibility
⑤ develop personality 

35. In seeking goals, it is important to know about the 
“eleventh hour.” Have you ever noticed in life that things 
can look really gloomy just before a dramatic turn for the 
better? A successful businessman reports that just before 
he made his fortune, he was about to quit. He was up the 
creek without a paddle when, suddenly, everything began to 
fall into place. He held out to the end to get his payoff. 
Perhaps you have had this experience; when wondering if 
life was worth all the effort, you met somebody who made 
the dark clouds go away. Life is like that because there is 
a principle at work here ─ the “eleventh hour” principle. It 
is always darkest and coldest just before dawn. But if we   
, we will get our rewards. [3점]
① remain punctual ② set realistic goals  
③ hang on long enough ④ enjoy new experiences 
⑤ do good deeds in secret 
36. Ideas sometimes occur                                                   . 
This is how the idea for Harry Potter came to author J. K. 
Rowling. She was taking a long train journey from Manchester 
to London and the idea for Harry just fell into her head. 
Another recent example is Trevor Bayliss’s human-powered 
windup radio. This idea suddenly “hit” him after he had been 
watching a television program about the alarming spread of 
AIDS in Africa. The program had mentioned the problem of 
providing education to prevent the disease in isolated regions 
without electrical power. In an instant he realized that a windup 
radio could help to solve the problem. Straight away he went 
into his workshop and began working on the idea. [3점]
① through repeated trial and error 
② unexpectedly in a flash of inspiration
③ intentionally after thorough observation  
④ only when the external conditions are favorable 
⑤ simply through the improvement of existing things 
37. 다음 글의 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
If you can find a pattern, rule, or underlying principle in the 
material, you will likely be able to learn it more easily.    
(A)       , if you arrange the number 376315374264 in four 
groups of three, it is easier to remember (376-315-374
-264). The task is even easier if you can see some patterns or 
relationships among the four groups. The first three groups all 
start with 3, and the first and third groups both have a 7 next; 
the second digits in the last two groups are only one digit apart 
(7 and 6), and the last digit is the same (4). Noticing such 
patterns helps make the number more meaningful.     (B)      , 
looking for patterns in phone numbers, addresses, dates, or any 
other numbers will help you remember them. 
(A) (B)
① However …… Otherwise
② Therefore …… Nevertheless
③ In contrast …… Moreover
④ For instance …… Instead
⑤ For example …… Similarly
38. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Our ability to recognize and respond to discomfort is critical 
for preventing physical damage to the body. ① Consider how 
often you shift position in your chair when you are studying or 
sitting in a lecture. ② If you were unable to receive signals of 
discomfort from your body, you would not move to relieve 
pressure on your skin. ③ Movement or noise in the classroom 
may distract the students from their work. ④ The parts of 
your skin under continuous pressure would develop sores or 
bruises. ⑤ Since many everyday experiences would be 
damaging to our bodies if we were not able to detect discomfort, 
a lack of ability to detect pain could cause serious problems.

Then there came a knock at the door and, “Santa Claus!” shouted the children.
Even when the father of seven children had been injured and 
was in the hospital, the children were sure that Santa Claus 
would fill their stockings. ( ① ) To the mother, the situation 
was desperate, because the family needed food and clothing, 
and there were long weeks ahead before her husband could 
leave the hospital. ( ② ) While the children talked about roller 
skates, dolls and Christmas trees, she was trying to figure out 
how to keep the home going. ( ③ ) It was not Santa Claus, but 
Mr. Adams, who lived next door, with a smile extending clear 
across his face. ( ④ ) He carried a bag filled with toys in his 
arms. ( ⑤ ) Behind him stood the whole neighborhood, bringing 
toys and food and clothing; enough to carry the family through 
the weeks ahead.

(A)
Every weekend Billy’s parents give him $100 to spend. It 
all started when Billy wanted a really cool CD player. He 
asked his parents if they would buy it for (a) him and they 
said no. “But it’s only $100!” he complained. An hour later, 
his parents announced there would be a family meeting the 
next night at dinner. 
(B)
For Billy, one of those ways was to allow him to shop for 
the family. Each Saturday, Billy was to be given $100 ─
along with a shopping list of groceries for the family. It was 
up to (b) him to buy everything on the list. Whatever money 
was left over, whether two dollars or thirty, was Billy’s to 
keep and spend on what he wanted ─ whether for going to 
the movies, or for buying books.
(C)
They’d never had a family meeting before, so Billy and his 
brother Gabe were worried. “This must be really serious,” 
Gabe said when (c) he was alone with Billy in the living 
room. Billy said, “They’re going to make us do chores.” The 
next night, their parents opened the family meeting with the 
words, “We’ve been thinking about how to give you more say 
in our family.” They brought up a number of new ways 
(d) his brother and Billy could get involved.
(D)
Billy has been having more say in the family now for nearly 
two months, and his parents’ $100-a-week plan gives him 
real incentive to shop for the best bargains. Practically his 
whole lifestyle depends on it! Billy has learned to look for 
the best prices. Billy is still saving for his CD player ─ and 
he is also taking his cue from his parents and working on 
creative ways to get what (e) he wants.

A general sales manager, recently promoted, no longer took 
a regular lunch time off. He felt that since his job involved 
more responsibility, he should be available all the time, and 
so he just grabbed a quick sandwich on the run. After several 
weeks of this, he found himself irritable in the afternoon, 
arguing with his colleagues, and having difficulty concentrating 
on important matters. One of these colleagues convinced him 
that he needed a sit-down lunch to restore his energy and 
inner calm. So he began having a more leisurely lunch and 
made certain that nothing interfered with this midday break. 
He developed the practice of going to lunch with a different 
person each day. Some were friends with whom he enjoyed a 
social occasion. Gradually he also lunched with all his 
coworkers and got to know them better. When he had to ask 
them to do something for him or when they were asking him 
for help, he had the benefit of                                         to
