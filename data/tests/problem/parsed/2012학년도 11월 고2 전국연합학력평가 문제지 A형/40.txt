Ingredients 
flour, sugar, baking powder, 
milk, eggs, salt, oil, etc. 
Directions
(A) Brush oil on both the top and bottom plates of 
the waffle iron. For deep, Belgian-style 
waffles, fill each space with a 1/2 cup of 
batter and cook seven to eight minutes until 
golden brown.
(B) Preheat your waffle iron to its hottest setting. 
In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking 
powder, and salt, and set aside. In another 
bowl, beat together the eggs and milk in the 
oil. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture 
and mix until just combined.
(C) Remove the waffles out of the iron. If you 
want to serve them with different toppings, 
slice some of your favorite fruit to put on top 
of the warm waffles. Enjoy your tasty, 
homemade treat!
