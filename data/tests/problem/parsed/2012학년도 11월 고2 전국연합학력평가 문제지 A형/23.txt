Let’s say that you are training for a certain race and your 
schedule calls for a 10 percent increase in mileage this week, 
yet you’re feeling a little pain in your legs. How do you 
respond? Do you go ahead and follow the schedule, or do you 
change it? You know the right answer. Yet many runners insist 
on sticking to the printed training schedule, since they believe 
that any change will ruin their chances of running a good race. 
In fact, the opposite is true. You would benefit more by giving 
your body a chance to recover. Training schedules are built on 
the assumption that you aren’t experiencing any unusual pains 
before, during, or after the run. If pain or fatigue does strike, 
don’t hesitate to change your workouts.
