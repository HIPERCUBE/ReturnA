To Whom It May Concern: 
I bought a rice cooker about six months ago at 
Mincefield’s Department Store (Model 20-V, with a 
1-year warranty). When I tried to use it last week, 
however, the power button would not work. I tried to 
return the item to the store, but Mincefield’s would 
not honor the warranty, because it is going out of 
business. The manager suggested that I contact you, 
the manufacturer. So, I’m sending you the cooker with 
this letter. Please have the cooker repaired and return 
it to my work address: 2003 Mountainview, Houston, 
TX 79050. I use the cooker quite frequently so I would 
appreciate your promptness.
Sincerely,
S usan  T iffin
