Some people are especially sensitive about being properly 
addressed; others are more tolerant. In our casual world, we 
often overlook the fact that people have last names and titles. 
We can never assume that a person wishes to be addressed by 
their first name; to do so implies familiarity, which is not 
always appreciated. You may not know the person well, you 
may be mistakenly shortening their name, or you may be calling 
them by the wrong name altogether. To be on the conservative 
side, address a person with a title of Mrs., Ms., or Mr. until you 
are advised otherwise. Errors in using people’s names can spoil 
business dealings, particularly when working with individuals 
from cultural backgrounds with which you are not very familiar.
