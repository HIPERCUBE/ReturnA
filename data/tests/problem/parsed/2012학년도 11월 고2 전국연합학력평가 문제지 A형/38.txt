Our ability to recognize and respond to discomfort is critical 
for preventing physical damage to the body. ① Consider how 
often you shift position in your chair when you are studying or 
sitting in a lecture. ② If you were unable to receive signals of 
discomfort from your body, you would not move to relieve 
pressure on your skin. ③ Movement or noise in the classroom 
may distract the students from their work. ④ The parts of 
your skin under continuous pressure would develop sores or 
bruises. ⑤ Since many everyday experiences would be 
damaging to our bodies if we were not able to detect discomfort, 
a lack of ability to detect pain could cause serious problems.
