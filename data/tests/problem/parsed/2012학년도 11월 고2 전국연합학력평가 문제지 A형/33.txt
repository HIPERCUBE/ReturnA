33. 다음 글에서 할머니가 느꼈을 심경의 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Suddenly everyone was startled by the children running 
toward their grandmother, screaming and shouting in terror, “A 
bear! A bear!” The grandmother called to all the children to run 
as fast as possible for home. When the children had all started 
for home, the grandmother ran too. Shouting to the children not 
to stop running, she turned around and saw that the bear was 
very close to her. She soon realized that she could never outrun 
the animal. She must do something. Turning suddenly, she 
pointed an umbrella straight at the bear. To her surprise the 
bear stopped, though he still growled. The grandmother, seeing 
the bear’s fright, held the umbrella aimed at him, and to her 
great relief he turned around in the path and fled out of sight.
