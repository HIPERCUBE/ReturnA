42. A tree seems to be vulnerable in many aspects. Its overall
architectural and biological design would seem to doom it from
the start. A narrow trunk topped by a gigantic sail made of
leaves would seem to make it a structure destined to fall over
in even a modest wind. The distance between the roots, which
gather the water, and the leaves, which transform that water
via photosynthesis, is a long, gravity‑defying journey― in some
cases a trip exceeding the length of a football field. Their
initial growth, a very slow pace compared with the shrubs and
weeds around them, would seem to set up a battle for sunlight
and water they could never win. Yet, trees have not only
survived but thrived.
