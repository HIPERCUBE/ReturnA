40. The motor of our ingenuity is the question “Does it have
to be like this?”, from which arise political reforms,
scientific developments, improved relationships, and better
books. The Romans hated winter cold and developed
under‑floor heating. They didn’t wish to walk on muddy
roads, so they paved them. They didn’t want to suffer the
frustration of a shallow public baths, so they drew water
through mountains and across valleys in a system of
aqueducts and underground pipes. The Chinese didn’t want to
find their sailors lost on the sea, so they invented a
compass to help them. They were unhappy when the sailing
ship could only move when the wind blew from behind them,
so they invented sails that allowed ships to sail against the
wind. There would be few great human achievements if we
accepted all our frustrations. * aqueduct: 수로(水路)
