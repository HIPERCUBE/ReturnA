Foot‑and‑Mouth Disease(FMD) is a highly contagious
disease caused by a virus. It is almost exclusive to cattle,
sheep, swine, goats, and other cloven‑hoofed animals. Among
its symptoms are fever, loss of appetite and weight, and
blisters on the tongue, lips, other tissues of the mouth, and
the feet. The disease is readily spread by contact; by
contaminated food or water; or through the air. Humans, who
seldom contract the disease, may be carriers, as may rats,
dogs, birds, and wild animals. Complete disposal of infected
animals and disinfection of contaminated material are
prescribed to limit contagion. No effective treatment exists;
vaccines control epidemics but have not eliminated them.
