We tend to think of the skin as a separate organ― just a
①wrapping of our more delicate inner parts. But the skin is
connected to every system in the body― from your circular
and digestive systems to your immune and nervous systems.
All must work ② interactively for total body health. Both
heart and skin, for example, rely on veins. This helps explain
why, when you get angry, your heart beats faster and your
face ③ reddens. This interconnectedness between the skin
and the internal body is largely forgotten by people who see
skin as a ④ connected entity. It’s a two‑way street. When
we damage the skin, we damage our insides. Similarly, what
we experience inside our bodies could have ⑤ indications on
the outside.
