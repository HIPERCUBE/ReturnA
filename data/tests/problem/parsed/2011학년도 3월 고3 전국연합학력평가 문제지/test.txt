It’s a question we’d all like answered: Is there life after
death? In November of 2009 I was pronounced clinically
dead. But the diagnosis was correct only up to a point. My
experience fed a fierce curiosity to know how “normal” such
experiences are. Since that time, I have interviewed 184
people who have also been to the “other side” and returned.
I have a diverse collection of anecdotal evidence that there
is indeed more to life than life. Would you be interested in
seeing some or all of my 70,000‑word manuscript? I can
send the complete manuscript, or if you prefer, sample
chapters and a detailed synopsis. I look forward to hearing
from you as soon as possible.

Phyllis has arranged to take the morning off to spend time
with her daughter, Gloria. Phyllis is so happy that ① she is
able to spend time with her little angel. Things are moving
right on schedule and ② she heads to the supermarket with
her daughter. Time passes, and with only an hour left before
getting to the office, Phyllis becomes conscious of the clock.
Phyllis tries to place her daughter in the shopping cart, but
③ she repeatedly screams “NO SIT!” With a nervous grin on
her face, Phyllis masks the anger she feels. ④ She has
never been challenged so strongly by Gloria. In all the mess
of the scene, Phyllis does not realize the significance of the
event. For the very first time, ⑤ she heard Gloria put two
words together to express a thought.

Archaeologist Mark Aldenderfer set out last year to explore
remote cliffside caves in Nepal’s Mustang district, aiming to
find human remains near an ancient settlement ① high in the
Himalayas. Almost at once, he came face‑to‑face with ②what
he was seeking: Sticking out from the rock, a skull was
looking at him right ③ as he was looking at it. The skull,
dating back perhaps 2,500 years, was among many human
bones ④ piled inside several burial caves. Aldenderfer and his
team hope that DNA analysis will pinpoint the origins of this
isolated region’s inhabitants, who may ⑤migrate from the
Tibetan Plateau or southern points.

Ultrasound, an imaging technique, produces an image by
(A) bounce / bouncing sound waves off an object inside the
body. A picture is then made using the reflected sound
waves. The frequency of sound waves used in ultrasound
imaging (B) range / ranges above human hearing. The choice
of frequency depends on how deep into the body the sound
waves are needed to penetrate. Lower frequencies allow
doctors to see structures deeper inside the body. The lower
the frequency, however, the less (C) clear / clearly the image
will become. Doctors use ultrasound to visualize the size and
structure of internal organs.

22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
We tend to consider water consumption in strictly
immediate terms, such as taking a shower or doing the
laundry. ① But it overlooks the inter‑connectivity of water
use and does not take into account “virtual water”
consumption. ② Virtual water refers to water used in the
production of an industrial or agricultural product. ③A single
cotton T‑shirt, for example, requires over 700 gallons of
water to be brought into being. ④ Fabrics made of Egyptian
cotton are softer, finer and last longer than any other cotton
in the world. ⑤While purchasing a T‑shirt involves no direct
water expenditure, the garment is the product of a large
investment of water resources.
23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
According to a psychologist, a business executive spends an
hour of his day reading, two hours talking and eight hours
listening. Yet in school we spend a large amount of time
teaching children how to read, a small amount of time teaching
them how to speak, and usually no time at all teaching them
how to listen. I do not believe it would be a good thing to
make what we teach in school exactly proportional to what we
do after school, but I do think we would be wise to give our
children some instruction in the process of listening. Listening
well is an exercise of attention and those who listen well tend
to have good relationships with colleagues.

24. Years ago, I was involved in planning a police operation
that was to take place in Lakeland, Florida. As the mission
planner was describing the operation order, he seemed to
have everything covered. His arms were outstretched over
two chairs as he confidently explained the very detailed
arrest plan. Suddenly someone asked, “Have you contacted
the Lakeland ambulance crew?” Instantly the mission planner
withdrew his arms and dropped them between his knees,
palms together. He went from dominating a large space to
being as narrow as possible, all because he had not made
the necessary arrangements. He suddenly lost the initiative.
This is a striking example of how quickly our behaviors ebb
and flow depending on our level of .
① confidence ② intelligence ③ morality
④ patience ⑤ imagination
25. A “pot‑stirrer” is someone who brings up emotional issues
that have already been resolved. Pot‑stirrers want to feed
the emotional fire and keep it burning for the excitement of
the conflict. They can be subtle; they often even appear to
be the “helpful” friend or “caring” listener. Let’s say you’ve
just let go of a minor conflict with your neighbor, when
your other neighbor continues to bring up how annoying this
person is, encouraging you . The same
applies at work. A coworker keeps reminding you that it
was you, not Gail, who really deserved the credit for that
great idea. Every time he or she says it, it upsets you and
opens your wound again.
① to cooperate with your competitors
② to find the virtues of your neighbor
③ not to lose your inner peace of mind
④ to hold on to your irritation with the person
⑤ not to be involved in your neighbor’s business
26. Aristotle distinguished between essential and accidental
properties. Essential properties are those without which a
thing wouldn’t be what it is, and accidental properties are
those that determine how a thing is, but not what it is. For
example, Aristotle thought rationality was essential to being
a human being. Socrates’ rationality was essential to his
being Socrates. On the other hand, Aristotle thought Socrates’
property of being snub‑nosed was merely accidental; being
snub‑nosed was part of how Socrates was, but it wasn’t
essential to what or who he was. In other words, take away
Socrates’ rationality, and , but give him
plastic surgery, and he’s Socrates with a nose job.
① he becomes freer ② it removes how he is
③ he’s no longer Socrates ④ it explains why he lives
⑤ his essential being remains
27. A team of researchers found out the alarming low death
rate of a small village of Roseto and started to investigate
it. While investigating, they realized that the secret of
Roseto wasn’t diet or exercise or genes or location. They
looked at how the Rosetans visited one another. They
learned about the extended family clans that underlay the
town’s social structure. They saw how many homes had
three generations living under one roof, and how much
respect grandparents commanded. They noticed the particular
belief in equality of the community, which discouraged the
wealthy from boasting about their success and helped the
unsuccessful obscure their failures. These findings suggested
the Rosetans had created .
① a unique and effective farming method
② a healthy, well‑balanced diet for the old
③ an education system to maintain their culture
④ a closely connected and protective social structure
⑤ an economic policy increasing the income of the village
28. In a study, hundreds of participants were asked to watch a
short film and then discuss it with another participant. Half
the participants were given an “impression management goal”
to appear outgoing, smart, or happy. After the discussions,
participants rated themselves and the person they had chatted
with across several personality traits. Those with an
impression management goal rated their conversation partner
significantly lower on the trait they were trying to show in
themselves, but not on other personality traits. This seems
to happen because when we focus on exaggerating a
particular trait in ourselves, we unconsciously increase the
standard for that trait in others― and they usually fall
short. So just because someone you’re trying to impress
doesn’t seem as active, friendly or positive as you are,
don’t assume that they truly aren’t. It could just be that
has changed the game. [3점]
① how many partners you have to rate
② what kind of movie you’d like to see
③ what personality traits your partner possesses
④ how different your opinions about the movie are
⑤ what impression you are trying to give to others
29. Farmers plant more seeds than are necessary to ensure
full breeding. If more plants sprout than are necessary, the
extra plants should be pulled out, before they choke out the
most promising sprout. It can be difficult for farmers to kill
their own offspring, even though they know it’s for the best.
Writers sometimes face the same dilemma. You are faced
with tough choices where certain scenes you love and worked
hard on just don’t fit into the story. Maybe there is a
character you adore, but he does nothing to move the story
along. If you are getting good sound advice from all around
you that certain materials don’t work, think about being
flexible in order to . [3점]
① find a way to make your story more complex
② gather as many details as possible for your work
③ make sure you don’t choke out the story with them
④ conceal the place you want to go with your readers
⑤ have a good opportunity to analyze other people’s works

In Europe, if your industry declines and you lose your job,
it is a big blow but not the end of the world. You will still
keep your health insurance and public housing, while
receiving unemployment benefits, government‑subsidized
retraining and government help in your job search. (A) ,
if you are a worker in the US, you’d better hold on to your
current job because losing your job means losing almost
everything. Unemployment insurance coverage is smaller than
in Europe. There is little public help with retraining and job
search. More frighteningly, losing your job means losing your
health insurance and your home, as there is little public
housing or public subsidies for your rent. (B) , worker
resistance to any industrial restructuring that involves job
cuts is much greater in the US than in Europe.

It is the elderly who often suffer the most as temperatures
drop. Physiologically, their blood vessels are more liable to
(A) contract / expand and their blood pressure rises.
Financially, they are less likely to turn up the heating and
more likely to use public transport. Socially, they may have
fewer people around them to (B) identify / intensify their
problems. One of the effects of aging is that your body is
less able to regulate its temperature, so you become less
able to judge if you are warm or cold. Failing to keep
adequately warm can (C) adapt / expose older people to the
threat of cold‑related illnesses, which contribute to thousands
of excess winter deaths each year.

We tend to think of the skin as a separate organ― just a
①wrapping of our more delicate inner parts. But the skin is
connected to every system in the body― from your circular
and digestive systems to your immune and nervous systems.
All must work ② interactively for total body health. Both
heart and skin, for example, rely on veins. This helps explain
why, when you get angry, your heart beats faster and your
face ③ reddens. This interconnectedness between the skin
and the internal body is largely forgotten by people who see
skin as a ④ connected entity. It’s a two‑way street. When
we damage the skin, we damage our insides. Similarly, what

33. For many generations, scholars and artists tended to
concentrate their energy on one particular subject. For
Shakespeare, that interest was literature. For Mozart, that
interest was musical composition, and for Newton, physics.
Visual artists were not expected to understand higher
mathematics, nor were philosophers expected to study
engineering. However, with the development of the Internet
and other sources of instantaneous information, many people
strive to gain at least a working knowledge of many different
subjects. So‑called pancake people no longer concentrate their
energies on one area of interest, but instead choose to
spread themselves thinly over a large area. As a result, a
new generation of pancake people have essentially become
the proverbial jacks of all trades, but masters of none.
① new jobs produced by the Internet
② rise of the new generation of artists
③ characteristics of young people’s thinking
④ necessity of instantaneous information sources
⑤ appearance of people with varied but superficial knowledge
34. Bright colored foods frequently seem to taste better than
bland‑looking foods, even when the flavor compounds are
identical. Foods that somehow look off‑color often seem to
have off tastes. For thousands of years, human beings have
relied on visual cues to help determine what is edible. The
color of fruit suggests whether it is ripe; the color of meat
whether it is fresh. Flavor researchers sometimes use
colored lights to modify the influence of visual cues during taste
tests. During one experiment in the early 1970s, people were
served an oddly colored meal of steak and French fries that
appeared normal beneath colored lights. Everyone thought
that the meal tasted fine until the lighting was changed.
Once it became apparent that the steak was actually blue
and the fries were green, some people became ill.
① effect of color of food on taste perception
② ways to improve the taste of food
③ difficulty of preserving food
④ growing popularity of food decoration
⑤ factors influencing the nutritional value of food

The above graph shows how tuition fees and dorm and
board costs for full‑time college students changed over the
last 30 years. ①Over the period, both college tuition fees
and dorm and board costs for full‑time students went up
steadily. ②Of all the periods, the 1978‑1979 period was the
only one when college students paid more for their dorm and
board costs than for their tuition fees. ③During the
1988‑1989 period, tuition fees surpassed dorm and board
costs for the first time and the former cost more than the
latter thereafter. ④The tuition fees of the 2008‑2009 period
were more than twice those of the 1993‑1994 period. ⑤The
gap between tuition fees and dorm and board costs was the
biggest during the 2008‑2009 period.
36. pilum에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The pilum was a heavy spear, used for thrusting or
throwing by Roman soldiers. It had a leaf‑shaped iron head,
60 to 90 centimeters long, embedded in or socketed onto a
wooden shaft with a short iron spike at the rear. Its length
seems to have been around 163 centimeters, although
examples as long as 274 centimeters were found in the
excavation of a swamp site in Illerup, Denmark. Roman
armies were the only ones who used the pilum, which may
mean there were strict regulations on its manufacture and
trade. During the second century A.D. there was a decline in
the use of the pilum, but in the third and fourth centuries it
regained its popularity and was used against the early
barbarian invaders.

37. FMD에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Foot‑and‑Mouth Disease(FMD) is a highly contagious
disease caused by a virus. It is almost exclusive to cattle,
sheep, swine, goats, and other cloven‑hoofed animals. Among
its symptoms are fever, loss of appetite and weight, and
blisters on the tongue, lips, other tissues of the mouth, and
the feet. The disease is readily spread by contact; by
contaminated food or water; or through the air. Humans, who
seldom contract the disease, may be carriers, as may rats,
dogs, birds, and wild animals. Complete disposal of infected
animals and disinfection of contaminated material are
prescribed to limit contagion. No effective treatment exists;
vaccines control epidemics but have not eliminated them.

38. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
I packed the few things that I possessed, and I set out on
a journey westward to my uncle’s. I mourned both for my
mother and the world I was leaving behind. Before I
disappeared behind the hills, I turned and looked at my
village for the last time. I could see the simple huts and the
people going about their chores; the stream where I had
splashed and played with the other boys; the maize fields
and green pastures where the herds and flocks were lazily
grazing. Above all else, my eyes rested on the simple hut
where I had enjoyed my mother’s love. It was this hut that
I associated with all my happiness, with life itself, and I
rued the fact that I had not kissed it before I left.
① sad and sorry ② moved and happy
③ upset and nervous ④ shocked and scared
⑤ bored and depressed

39. Consider a fascinating study by a major French food
manufacturer testing two different containers for a diet
mayonnaise product aimed at female shoppers. Both
containers held the exact same mayonnaise and bore the
exact same label. The only difference was the shapes of the
bottles. The first was narrow around the middle, and thicker
at the top and on the bottom. The second had a slender neck
but a fat, round bottom, like a genie bottle. When asked
which product they preferred, every single subject― all
diet‑conscious females― selected the first bottle without
even having tasted the stuff. Why? The researchers
concluded that the subjects were associating the shape of the
bottle with an image of their own bodies.

40. The motor of our ingenuity is the question “Does it have
to be like this?”, from which arise political reforms,
scientific developments, improved relationships, and better
books. The Romans hated winter cold and developed
under‑floor heating. They didn’t wish to walk on muddy
roads, so they paved them. They didn’t want to suffer the
frustration of a shallow public baths, so they drew water
through mountains and across valleys in a system of
aqueducts and underground pipes. The Chinese didn’t want to
find their sailors lost on the sea, so they invented a
compass to help them. They were unhappy when the sailing
ship could only move when the wind blew from behind them,
so they invented sails that allowed ships to sail against the
wind. There would be few great human achievements if we
accepted all our frustrations. * aqueduct: 수로(水路)

41. The forbidding sands of the Sahara might seem an unusual
place for farming. But if you’re farming silicon to make solar
panels, the conditions in the Sahara are more or less
optimal. At least, that’s the thinking behind the Sahara Solar
Breeder Project. The plan, a joint project proposed by
Japanese and Algerian universities, would use the desert’s
immense supplies of sunlight and sand to “breed” solar
power plants and solar panel factories. The idea is to start
with a small number of silicon manufacturing plants that will
produce the silicon needed to manufacture solar panels. Once
those panels are operating, they can be used to power the
silicon plants, which in turn produce more silicon and solar
panels. The universities envision breeding enough silicon and
solar panels by 2050 to supply half the world’s energy.

42. A tree seems to be vulnerable in many aspects. Its overall
architectural and biological design would seem to doom it from
the start. A narrow trunk topped by a gigantic sail made of
leaves would seem to make it a structure destined to fall over
in even a modest wind. The distance between the roots, which
gather the water, and the leaves, which transform that water
via photosynthesis, is a long, gravity‑defying journey― in some
cases a trip exceeding the length of a football field. Their
initial growth, a very slow pace compared with the shrubs and
weeds around them, would seem to set up a battle for sunlight
and water they could never win. Yet, trees have not only
survived but thrived.

Anthropologist Brain Hare has done experiments with
dogs, where he puts a piece of food under one of two
cups, placed several feet apart. The dog knows that there
is food to be had, but has no idea which of the cups
holds the prize.
(A) This difference is in their cooperations with humans.
Hare explains that primates are very good at using the
cues of the same species. But they are not good at
using human cues when you are trying to cooperate
with them.
(B) In contrast, dogs pay attention to humans, when humans
are doing something very human. Dogs aren’t smarter
than chimps, but they just have a different attitude
toward people, and they are really interested in humans.
(C) Then, Hare points at the right cup, taps on it, and looks
directly at it. What happens? The dog goes to the right
cup virtually every time. Yet when Hare did the same
experiment with chimpanzees, the chimps couldn’t get it
right. A dog will look at you for help, and a chimp
won’t.

drug, perhaps out of fear that the new generic drugs are
not actually the same as the drug they have been using
for years.
When a firm discovers a new drug, patent laws give the
firm a monopoly on the sale of that drug. ( ① ) During the
life of the patent, the monopoly firm maximizes profit by
controlling the quantity and the price. ( ② ) But eventually
when the patent on a drug expires, other companies quickly
enter the market and begin selling so‑called generic products
that are chemically identical to the former monopolist’s
brand‑name product. ( ③ ) And expectedly, the price of the
competitively produced generic drug is well below the price
that the monopolist was charging. ( ④ ) The expiration of
a patent, however, does not cause the monopolist to lose all
its market power. ( ⑤ )　As a result, the former monopolist
can continue to charge a price at least somewhat above the
price charged by its new competitors.

Architects are usually rewarded according to the
uniqueness of their work. But an architect intent on being
different may in the end prove as troubling as an
over‑imaginative pilot or doctor. However important
originality may be, adherence to familiar form emerges as
the more significant virtue in architecture. We rarely wish
to be surprised by novelty as we go round street corners.
We require consistency in our buildings, for there is
already too much confusion around us. We need the
discipline offered by similarity, just as children need
regular bedtimes and familiar foods. We require that our
buildings act as guardians of composure when we are in
them. The architects who benefit us most may be those
generous enough to lay aside their claims to genius. They
will devote themselves to designing graceful but unoriginal
buildings, where we will not feel disoriented.
Architects should try to offer people calmness coming
from (A) rather than focus on the (B) of
their work.
(A) (B)
① familiarity ······ originality
② familiarity ······ profits
③ safety ······ popularity
④ safety ······ originality
⑤ beauty ······ popularity

(A)
Sen no Rikyu was the most famous tea master of all in
Japan. He was famous for his remarkable ability to
harmonize himself with his guests’ thoughts and to think
one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting to their
taste. Once, another great 16th‑century Japanese tea
master Takeno Sho‑o passed by a house. (a) He noticed
a young man watering flowers near his front gate. Two
things caught Sho‑o’s attention— first, the graceful way
the man performed his task; second, the beautiful rose of
Sharon blossoms that bloomed in the garden.
(B)
Now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the gate
he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu’s
tea room. Immediately inside, (b) he stopped in his
tracks and gazed in astonishment: Before him a vase
hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single
rose of Sharon blossom, the most beautiful one in the
garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu , and
with this one eloquent gesture, had demonstrated that
this day’s guest and host would be in perfect harmony.
(C)
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer— he watched
those around him acutely, understanding the subtle
gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then producing that
desire’s image. Although Sho‑o never spoke of being
enchanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it
in his eye. (c) He knew that studying people’s eyes was a
surer barometer of pain and pleasure than any spoken
word.
(D)
He stopped and introduced himself to the man, whose
name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho‑o wanted to stay, but had
to hurry off for a prior engagement. Before Sho‑o left,
however, Rikyu invited him to take tea with him the next
morning. Sho‑o happily accepted. When Sho‑o opened the
garden gate the next day, (d) he was horrified to see not
a single flower remained. More than anything else, he
had come there to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that
(e) he had not had the time to appreciate the day before.

Most managers want huge results with little risk. It just
doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to encourage risk
taking without penalty. Human beings by nature hate to
lose. We’re willing to take risks when there’s little
downside, especially if we can see a huge potential
upside. But when things are going fine, we shy away
from taking risks. Not a good idea! In a corporation, too
often it’s one foul and you’re benched. But in the NBA,
every player is allowed six fouls per game. Company
managers and executives should establish a six‑foul rule,
and make it known to everyone.
Think about how some of the most successful coaches
in the NBA view fouls. If LeBron and Kobe end the game
with zero fouls, you know they’re not playing their best
game. If they end the game with five fouls, they’ve
pushed it to the limit and chances are they’ve scored
more points, gotten more rebounds, and gotten more
steals. Once in a while, you foul out. That’s part of the
game. Winners know one thing all too well: You’re not
going to win every game. Let your players get their
fouls. Innovations will come faster, sales will be higher,
and you’ll learn from failure.
Remember the traditional path is , but it will
produce average results, average market share, and
average profits. Unless you climb a mountain, you may
never know what you missed.
