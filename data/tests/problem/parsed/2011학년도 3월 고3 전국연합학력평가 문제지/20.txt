Archaeologist Mark Aldenderfer set out last year to explore
remote cliffside caves in Nepal’s Mustang district, aiming to
find human remains near an ancient settlement ① high in the
Himalayas. Almost at once, he came face‑to‑face with ②what
he was seeking: Sticking out from the rock, a skull was
looking at him right ③ as he was looking at it. The skull,
dating back perhaps 2,500 years, was among many human
bones ④ piled inside several burial caves. Aldenderfer and his
team hope that DNA analysis will pinpoint the origins of this
isolated region’s inhabitants, who may ⑤migrate from the
Tibetan Plateau or southern points.
