Anthropologist Brain Hare has done experiments with
dogs, where he puts a piece of food under one of two
cups, placed several feet apart. The dog knows that there
is food to be had, but has no idea which of the cups
holds the prize.
(A) This difference is in their cooperations with humans.
Hare explains that primates are very good at using the
cues of the same species. But they are not good at
using human cues when you are trying to cooperate
with them.
(B) In contrast, dogs pay attention to humans, when humans
are doing something very human. Dogs aren’t smarter
than chimps, but they just have a different attitude
toward people, and they are really interested in humans.
(C) Then, Hare points at the right cup, taps on it, and looks
directly at it. What happens? The dog goes to the right
cup virtually every time. Yet when Hare did the same
experiment with chimpanzees, the chimps couldn’t get it
right. A dog will look at you for help, and a chimp
won’t.
