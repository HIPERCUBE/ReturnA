34. Bright colored foods frequently seem to taste better than
bland‑looking foods, even when the flavor compounds are
identical. Foods that somehow look off‑color often seem to
have off tastes. For thousands of years, human beings have
relied on visual cues to help determine what is edible. The
color of fruit suggests whether it is ripe; the color of meat
whether it is fresh. Flavor researchers sometimes use
colored lights to modify the influence of visual cues during taste
tests. During one experiment in the early 1970s, people were
served an oddly colored meal of steak and French fries that
appeared normal beneath colored lights. Everyone thought
that the meal tasted fine until the lighting was changed.
Once it became apparent that the steak was actually blue
and the fries were green, some people became ill.
