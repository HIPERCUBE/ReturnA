It’s a question we’d all like answered: Is there life after
death? In November of 2009 I was pronounced clinically
dead. But the diagnosis was correct only up to a point. My
experience fed a fierce curiosity to know how “normal” such
experiences are. Since that time, I have interviewed 184
people who have also been to the “other side” and returned.
I have a diverse collection of anecdotal evidence that there
is indeed more to life than life. Would you be interested in
seeing some or all of my 70,000‑word manuscript? I can
send the complete manuscript, or if you prefer, sample
chapters and a detailed synopsis. I look forward to hearing
from you as soon as possible.
