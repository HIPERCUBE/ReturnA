36. pilum에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The pilum was a heavy spear, used for thrusting or
throwing by Roman soldiers. It had a leaf‑shaped iron head,
60 to 90 centimeters long, embedded in or socketed onto a
wooden shaft with a short iron spike at the rear. Its length
seems to have been around 163 centimeters, although
examples as long as 274 centimeters were found in the
excavation of a swamp site in Illerup, Denmark. Roman
armies were the only ones who used the pilum, which may
mean there were strict regulations on its manufacture and
trade. During the second century A.D. there was a decline in
the use of the pilum, but in the third and fourth centuries it
regained its popularity and was used against the early
barbarian invaders.
