We tend to consider water consumption in strictly
immediate terms, such as taking a shower or doing the
laundry. ① But it overlooks the inter‑connectivity of water
use and does not take into account “virtual water”
consumption. ② Virtual water refers to water used in the
production of an industrial or agricultural product. ③A single
cotton T‑shirt, for example, requires over 700 gallons of
water to be brought into being. ④ Fabrics made of Egyptian
cotton are softer, finer and last longer than any other cotton
in the world. ⑤While purchasing a T‑shirt involves no direct
water expenditure, the garment is the product of a large
investment of water resources.
