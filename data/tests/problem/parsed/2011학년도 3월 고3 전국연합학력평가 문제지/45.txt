Architects are usually rewarded according to the
uniqueness of their work. But an architect intent on being
different may in the end prove as troubling as an
over‑imaginative pilot or doctor. However important
originality may be, adherence to familiar form emerges as
the more significant virtue in architecture. We rarely wish
to be surprised by novelty as we go round street corners.
We require consistency in our buildings, for there is
already too much confusion around us. We need the
discipline offered by similarity, just as children need
regular bedtimes and familiar foods. We require that our
buildings act as guardians of composure when we are in
them. The architects who benefit us most may be those
generous enough to lay aside their claims to genius. They
will devote themselves to designing graceful but unoriginal
buildings, where we will not feel disoriented.
Architects should try to offer people calmness coming
from (A) rather than focus on the (B) of
their work.
(A) (B)
① familiarity ······ originality
② familiarity ······ profits
③ safety ······ popularity
④ safety ······ originality
⑤ beauty ······ popularity

(A)
Sen no Rikyu was the most famous tea master of all in
Japan. He was famous for his remarkable ability to
harmonize himself with his guests’ thoughts and to think
one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting to their
taste. Once, another great 16th‑century Japanese tea
master Takeno Sho‑o passed by a house. (a) He noticed
a young man watering flowers near his front gate. Two
things caught Sho‑o’s attention— first, the graceful way
the man performed his task; second, the beautiful rose of
Sharon blossoms that bloomed in the garden.
(B)
Now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the gate
he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu’s
tea room. Immediately inside, (b) he stopped in his
tracks and gazed in astonishment: Before him a vase
hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single
rose of Sharon blossom, the most beautiful one in the
garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu , and
with this one eloquent gesture, had demonstrated that
this day’s guest and host would be in perfect harmony.
(C)
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer— he watched
those around him acutely, understanding the subtle
gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then producing that
desire’s image. Although Sho‑o never spoke of being
enchanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it
in his eye. (c) He knew that studying people’s eyes was a
surer barometer of pain and pleasure than any spoken
word.
(D)
He stopped and introduced himself to the man, whose
name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho‑o wanted to stay, but had
to hurry off for a prior engagement. Before Sho‑o left,
however, Rikyu invited him to take tea with him the next
morning. Sho‑o happily accepted. When Sho‑o opened the
garden gate the next day, (d) he was horrified to see not
a single flower remained. More than anything else, he
had come there to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that
(e) he had not had the time to appreciate the day before.

Most managers want huge results with little risk. It just
doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to encourage risk
taking without penalty. Human beings by nature hate to
lose. We’re willing to take risks when there’s little
downside, especially if we can see a huge potential
upside. But when things are going fine, we shy away
from taking risks. Not a good idea! In a corporation, too
often it’s one foul and you’re benched. But in the NBA,
every player is allowed six fouls per game. Company
managers and executives should establish a six‑foul rule,
and make it known to everyone.
Think about how some of the most successful coaches
in the NBA view fouls. If LeBron and Kobe end the game
with zero fouls, you know they’re not playing their best
game. If they end the game with five fouls, they’ve
pushed it to the limit and chances are they’ve scored
more points, gotten more rebounds, and gotten more
steals. Once in a while, you foul out. That’s part of the
game. Winners know one thing all too well: You’re not
going to win every game. Let your players get their
fouls. Innovations will come faster, sales will be higher,
and you’ll learn from failure.
Remember the traditional path is , but it will
produce average results, average market share, and
average profits. Unless you climb a mountain, you may
never know what you missed.
