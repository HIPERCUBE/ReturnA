Architects are usually rewarded according to the
uniqueness of their work. But an architect intent on being
different may in the end prove as troubling as an
over‑imaginative pilot or doctor. However important
originality may be, adherence to familiar form emerges as
the more significant virtue in architecture. We rarely wish
to be surprised by novelty as we go round street corners.
We require consistency in our buildings, for there is
already too much confusion around us. We need the
discipline offered by similarity, just as children need
regular bedtimes and familiar foods. We require that our
buildings act as guardians of composure when we are in
them. The architects who benefit us most may be those
generous enough to lay aside their claims to genius. They
will devote themselves to designing graceful but unoriginal
buildings, where we will not feel disoriented.
Architects should try to offer people calmness coming
from (A) rather than focus on the (B) of
their work.
