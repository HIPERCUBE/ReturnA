According to a psychologist, a business executive spends an
hour of his day reading, two hours talking and eight hours
listening. Yet in school we spend a large amount of time
teaching children how to read, a small amount of time teaching
them how to speak, and usually no time at all teaching them
how to listen. I do not believe it would be a good thing to
make what we teach in school exactly proportional to what we
do after school, but I do think we would be wise to give our
children some instruction in the process of listening. Listening
well is an exercise of attention and those who listen well tend
to have good relationships with colleagues.
