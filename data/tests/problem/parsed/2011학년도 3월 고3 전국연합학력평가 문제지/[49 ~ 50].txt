Most managers want huge results with little risk. It just
doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to encourage risk
taking without penalty. Human beings by nature hate to
lose. We’re willing to take risks when there’s little
downside, especially if we can see a huge potential
upside. But when things are going fine, we shy away
from taking risks. Not a good idea! In a corporation, too
often it’s one foul and you’re benched. But in the NBA,
every player is allowed six fouls per game. Company
managers and executives should establish a six‑foul rule,
and make it known to everyone.
Think about how some of the most successful coaches
in the NBA view fouls. If LeBron and Kobe end the game
with zero fouls, you know they’re not playing their best
game. If they end the game with five fouls, they’ve
pushed it to the limit and chances are they’ve scored
more points, gotten more rebounds, and gotten more
steals. Once in a while, you foul out. That’s part of the
game. Winners know one thing all too well: You’re not
going to win every game. Let your players get their
fouls. Innovations will come faster, sales will be higher,
and you’ll learn from failure.
Remember the traditional path is , but it will
produce average results, average market share, and
average profits. Unless you climb a mountain, you may
never know what you missed.
