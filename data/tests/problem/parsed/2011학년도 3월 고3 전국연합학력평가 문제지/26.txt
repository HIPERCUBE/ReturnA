26. Aristotle distinguished between essential and accidental
properties. Essential properties are those without which a
thing wouldn’t be what it is, and accidental properties are
those that determine how a thing is, but not what it is. For
example, Aristotle thought rationality was essential to being
a human being. Socrates’ rationality was essential to his
being Socrates. On the other hand, Aristotle thought Socrates’
property of being snub‑nosed was merely accidental; being
snub‑nosed was part of how Socrates was, but it wasn’t
essential to what or who he was. In other words, take away
Socrates’ rationality, and , but give him
plastic surgery, and he’s Socrates with a nose job.
① he becomes freer ② it removes how he is
③ he’s no longer Socrates ④ it explains why he lives
