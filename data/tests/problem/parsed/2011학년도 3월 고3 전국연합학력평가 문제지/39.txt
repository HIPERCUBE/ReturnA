39. Consider a fascinating study by a major French food
manufacturer testing two different containers for a diet
mayonnaise product aimed at female shoppers. Both
containers held the exact same mayonnaise and bore the
exact same label. The only difference was the shapes of the
bottles. The first was narrow around the middle, and thicker
at the top and on the bottom. The second had a slender neck
but a fat, round bottom, like a genie bottle. When asked
which product they preferred, every single subject― all
diet‑conscious females― selected the first bottle without
even having tasted the stuff. Why? The researchers
concluded that the subjects were associating the shape of the
bottle with an image of their own bodies.
