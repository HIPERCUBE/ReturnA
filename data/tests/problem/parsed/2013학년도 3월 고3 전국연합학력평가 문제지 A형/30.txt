I was staying at a hotel in Tokyo. I had been a guest for g
about ten days and was returning to my room in the middle (
of an afternoon. I took the elevator to my floor. Entering th

Out of place. Different. I was in the wrong room! Someone p
else’s things were distributed around the head of the bed (
and the table. My first thoughts were, “What if I am o
discovered here? How do I explain my presence to a p
Japanese person who may not even speak English?” I 
checked my key again. Yes, it really was mine. Clearly they 
had moved somebody else into my room. But where was my ①

Sometimes athletes need to be allowed to practice their ③

everyone is sitting, someone who stands has a superior view. im
Spectators usually can see well if everyone sits or if to
everyone stands. Sitting in seats is more comfortable than a
standing. When there is no cooperation, everyone stands; a
each spectator does what is best for himself or herself given n
the actions of other spectators. If all spectators sit, someone, 
taking what the others will do as a given, will stand. If all 
spectators are standing, then it is best to remain standing. ①
With spectator cooperation, the solution is for everyone to ②
sit. The problem is that each spectator may be tempted to ③
get a better view by standing. The cooperative solution needs ④
