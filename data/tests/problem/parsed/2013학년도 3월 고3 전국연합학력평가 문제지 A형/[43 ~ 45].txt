(A)
It was a short flight. I’d brought only a carry­on bag, 
so I didn’t have to go to the baggage claim. A quick 
stop by the restroom and I’d head down to the lower 
level, where my friends were going to pick me up. Then 
I saw it. A cute little stuffed dog, sitting all by itself on 
a bench in the main terminal area. Some poor kid was 
probably heartbroken at having lost it. Okay, God, I 
thought, if that dog is still there when I get out of the 
restroom, I’ll trust you to show me what to do with it.

“Mom, we’ve been here for twenty minutes at least! 
Are you sure you’re in the right place?” The tension 
grew in her voice. I touched her gently on the arm. “I 
think I know what’s happening,” I said. “Your mom is at 
arrivals; this is departures.” I pointed at the sign. Relief 
washed over her face. “Mom, I’m sorry, we’re on the 
level for departures. I got mixed up,” she said. “The 
flight was so stressful, and I’ve been running all over 
the airport. Your granddaughter lost her stuffed dog 
somewhere.”
(C)
I pulled the stuffed dog out of my bag. The woman 
almost dropped her phone. The little girl squealed and 
gave me a hug. Just then my friends arrived. I waved to 
the woman and her little girl, then climbed into the car. 
“Sorry, we didn’t figure on traffic being quite that bad,” 
one of my friends said as we pulled away from the curb. 
Maybe they were late for a reason.
* squeal: 기쁨의 탄성을 지르다
(D)
Sure enough, the dog was still there, slumped over 
like a tired traveler. I picked it up, stuck it in my bag 
and headed out the door. I’d just gotten outside when 
my cell phone rang. “Becky, we’re going to be late. The 
traffic is really bad,” one of my friends said. “Don’t 
worry,” I said. “I’m outside the departures area. I’ll just 
wait here.” I stood by the curb chatting with my friend 
until I noticed a young woman talking loudly into her 
cell phone, looking frantic, with a little girl at her side.
