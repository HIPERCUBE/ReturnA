Sometimes athletes need to be allowed to practice their 
skills on their own before they receive feedback. That way 
they can determine what is working and what isn’t and can 
become more ① mindful of their strengths and weaknesses. If 
you attempt to provide assistance when athletes would prefer 
to practice on their own, you may be ② wasting a lot of time 
and breath. When athletes realize that their best efforts are 
producing ③ satisfactory outcomes, they are usually more 
motivated to hear what you have to say. In other words, 
athletes are responsive to assistance when they fail to achieve 
the outcome they were hoping for. A coach’s challenge, then, 
is to remain patient until these and other types of ④ teachable 
moments arise. The reward for such ⑤ patience is athletes 
who are motivated to hear what you have to say and eager to 
incorporate your suggestions.
