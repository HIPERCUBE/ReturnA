Dear Ms. Griffin,
I recently received my paycheck for the two­week period 
ending February 15, and it was $75.00 short. For this 
period I should have been paid $875.00. Instead, my 
check was for only $800.00. I believe I know why there 
may have been a difference. The $75.00 additional pay 
for this period was the result of my having put in five 
hours of overtime on February 8 and February 12. This 26.
overtime was not reflected on my current paycheck. I 
have double­checked with my supervisor, Gloria Arrelo, o
who assured me that she recorded my overtime on the o
time sheets she sent to your office. She has kindly given it
me a copy that I have scanned and have attached to this w
email to confirm my hours. frp

Sincerely, li
A

A study by Terry A. Hartig, a psychology professor at 
ppsala University in Sweden, tested a random group of 
dividuals. He asked them to carry out a forty­minute 
equence of tasks designed to exhaust their “directed 
ttention capacity.” He then instructed participants to spend 
rty minutes either walking in a local nature preserve, 
alking in an urban area, or sitting quietly while reading 
agazines and listening to music. He found that after this 
eriod those who had walked in the nature preserve 
erformed better than the other participants on a standard 
roofreading task. He reported that the greater the exposure 
outdoor activities in green spaces, the better people were 
ble to focus their attention.

Facilities managers should be aware of and take advantage 
f available resources to help companies meet the challenges 
f safety issues. Since power failures are rare, for example, 
is nearly impossible for people to remember what to do 
hen they occur. So training is needed to keep memory 
esh and provide practice so that actions are properly 
erformed. One such remedy is regular training. Some safety 
pics require more time to finish, but that should not be a 
miting factor in learning about ways to keep workers safe. 
fter all, workers are an organization’s most precious assets. 
lways have regular safety training sessions, usually every 
ear, and practice sessions quarterly.

I was staying at a hotel in Tokyo. I had been a guest for g
about ten days and was returning to my room in the middle (
of an afternoon. I took the elevator to my floor. Entering th
the room, I immediately sensed that something was wrong. c
Out of place. Different. I was in the wrong room! Someone p
else’s things were distributed around the head of the bed (
and the table. My first thoughts were, “What if I am o
discovered here? How do I explain my presence to a p
Japanese person who may not even speak English?” I 
checked my key again. Yes, it really was mine. Clearly they
