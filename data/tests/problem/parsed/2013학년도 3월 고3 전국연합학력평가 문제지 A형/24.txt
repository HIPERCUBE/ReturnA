Dear Ms. Griffin,
I recently received my paycheck for the two­week period 
ending February 15, and it was $75.00 short. For this 
period I should have been paid $875.00. Instead, my 
check was for only $800.00. I believe I know why there 
may have been a difference. The $75.00 additional pay 
for this period was the result of my having put in five 
hours of overtime on February 8 and February 12. This 
overtime was not reflected on my current paycheck. I 
have double­checked with my supervisor, Gloria Arrelo, 
who assured me that she recorded my overtime on the 
time sheets she sent to your office. She has kindly given 
me a copy that I have scanned and have attached to this 
email to confirm my hours.
Sincerely,
Robbie Burke
