Dear Ms. Griffin,
I recently received my paycheck for the two­week period 
ending February 15, and it was $75.00 short. For this 
period I should have been paid $875.00. Instead, my 
check was for only $800.00. I believe I know why there 
may have been a difference. The $75.00 additional pay 
for this period was the result of my having put in five 
hours of overtime on February 8 and February 12. This 26.
overtime was not reflected on my current paycheck. I 
have double­checked with my supervisor, Gloria Arrelo, o
who assured me that she recorded my overtime on the o
time sheets she sent to your office. She has kindly given it
me a copy that I have scanned and have attached to this w
email to confirm my hours. frp

Charlie Brown in Charles Schulz’s Peanuts comic strip, who ④

everyone is sitting, someone who stands has a superior view. im
Spectators usually can see well if everyone sits or if to
everyone stands. Sitting in seats is more comfortable than a
standing. When there is no cooperation, everyone stands; a
each spectator does what is best for himself or herself given n
the actions of other spectators. If all spectators sit, someone, 
taking what the others will do as a given, will stand. If all 
spectators are standing, then it is best to remain standing. ①
With spectator cooperation, the solution is for everyone to ②
sit. The problem is that each spectator may be tempted to ③
get a better view by standing. The cooperative solution needs ④
to be attained ― in this situation,                          . ⑤

Seasickness can occur anytime you board a sea vessel and 
ruin your entire cruise trip. Fortunately, there are effective 
ways to prevent or relieve it. ① As soon as you feel the 
beginning effects of seasickness, go to the deck of the ship 
and stare at the horizon. ② The constant wind and smell of 
the sea can make seasickness worse. ③ Another step you 
can take right away is to eat a small meal, such as 
crackers, some fruit or vegetables. ④ You can also use 
herbal remedies via taste and smell to relieve seasickness. 
⑤ Chamomile or lavender aromatherapy or essential oils have

Instead, it indicates that a very specific question served 
as a negative stimulus and really bothered the person.
I look for lip compression or disappearing lips during 
interviews or when someone is making a declarative 
statement. ( ① ) This is such a reliable cue that it will 
show up precisely at the moment a difficult question is 
asked. ( ② ) If you see it, that doesn’t necessarily mean the 
person is lying. ( ③ ) For example, if I ask someone, “Are 
you hiding something from me?” and he compresses his lips 
as I ask the question, he is hiding something. ( ④ ) This is 
especially accurate if it is the only time he has concealed or 
compressed his lips during our discussion. ( ⑤ ) It is a 
signal that I need to push further in questioning this person.

One day a pair of cardinals had built a nest in a tree 
right outside the window I faced. Day after day, I 
watched the parent birds feed their newly hatched 
chicks, and I watched the chicks grow. At first I could 
barely spy on them over the nest’s edge, but soon their 
heads stretched way out of the nest. The parent birds 
took turns flying in to fill their begging mouths that got 
bigger and bigger. Then one day the parent birds flew 
close to the nest ─ but didn’t fly in to feed the chicks. 
Instead, each time they neared the nest, and the baby 
birds opened wide to receive their meal, the parent birds 
changed courses and flew away. That was the day the 
little ones left the nest: One by one, they climbed up 
onto the nest’s edge and eventually hopped clear of it 
and onto a branch, all the while coaxed by the mother or 
father, who kept flying by, then flying away. 
What surprised and delighted me was that the parent 
birds did not push the little ones out of the nest. Nor 
did they simply stop coming by, so the chicks would 
have to come out to find food. By flying close and then 
flying away the parent birds                      . It 
seemed clear to me that the little birds finally left the 
nest in order to find their parents, who they could see 
were out there flying around.            * coax: 구슬리다

It was a short flight. I’d brought only a carry­on bag, ②

I saw it. A cute little stuffed dog, sitting all by itself on 
a bench in the main terminal area. Some poor kid was 
probably heartbroken at having lost it. Okay, God, I

I pulled the stuffed dog out of my bag. The woman 
almost dropped her phone. The little girl squealed and 
gave me a hug. Just then my friends arrived. I waved to 
the woman and her little girl, then climbed into the car. 
“Sorry, we didn’t figure on traffic being quite that bad,” 
one of my friends said as we pulled away from the curb. 
Maybe they were late for a reason.

Sure enough, the dog was still there, slumped over 
like a tired traveler. I picked it up, stuck it in my bag 
and headed out the door. I’d just gotten outside when 
my cell phone rang. “Becky, we’re going to be late. The 
traffic is really bad,” one of my friends said. “Don’t 
worry,” I said. “I’m outside the departures area. I’ll just 
wait here.” I stood by the curb chatting with my friend 
until I noticed a young woman talking loudly into her 
cell phone, looking frantic, with a little girl at her side.
