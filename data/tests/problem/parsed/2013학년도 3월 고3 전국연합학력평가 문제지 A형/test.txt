What would happen if you went to the soil and said, “Give 
me some fruit. Give me some plants”? The soil would 
probably respond, “Excuse me, sir, but you’re a little 
confused. You must be new here. That’s not the way the 
game is played.” Then it would explain that you should plant 
the seed. You take care of it. You water it and cultivate the 
soil. You fertilize it. You protect it and nurture it. Then, if 
you do it well, you will get your plant or your fruit 
sometime later. You could ask from the soil forever, but it 
wouldn’t change things. You have to keep giving, keep 
nurturing, for the soil to bear fruit ― and life is exactly the 
same way.

24. 다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Dear Ms. Griffin,
I recently received my paycheck for the two­week period 
ending February 15, and it was $75.00 short. For this 
period I should have been paid $875.00. Instead, my 
check was for only $800.00. I believe I know why there 
may have been a difference. The $75.00 additional pay 
for this period was the result of my having put in five 
hours of overtime on February 8 and February 12. This 
overtime was not reflected on my current paycheck. I 
have double­checked with my supervisor, Gloria Arrelo, 
who assured me that she recorded my overtime on the 
time sheets she sent to your office. She has kindly given 
me a copy that I have scanned and have attached to this 
email to confirm my hours.
Sincerely,
Robbie Burke

A study by Terry A. Hartig, a psychology professor at 
Uppsala University in Sweden, tested a random group of 
individuals. He asked them to carry out a forty­minute 
sequence of tasks designed to exhaust their “directed 
attention capacity.” He then instructed participants to spend 
forty minutes either walking in a local nature preserve, 
walking in an urban area, or sitting quietly while reading 
magazines and listening to music. He found that after this 
period those who had walked in the nature preserve 
performed better than the other participants on a standard 
proofreading task. He reported that the greater the exposure 
to outdoor activities in green spaces, the better people were 
able to focus their attention.

26. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Facilities managers should be aware of and take advantage 
of available resources to help companies meet the challenges 
of safety issues. Since power failures are rare, for example, 
it is nearly impossible for people to remember what to do 
when they occur. So training is needed to keep memory 
fresh and provide practice so that actions are properly 
performed. One such remedy is regular training. Some safety 
topics require more time to finish, but that should not be a 
limiting factor in learning about ways to keep workers safe. 
After all, workers are an organization’s most precious assets. 
Always have regular safety training sessions, usually every 
year, and practice sessions quarterly.

30. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
I was staying at a hotel in Tokyo. I had been a guest for 
about ten days and was returning to my room in the middle 
of an afternoon. I took the elevator to my floor. Entering 
the room, I immediately sensed that something was wrong. 
Out of place. Different. I was in the wrong room! Someone 
else’s things were distributed around the head of the bed 
and the table. My first thoughts were, “What if I am 
discovered here? How do I explain my presence to a 
Japanese person who may not even speak English?” I 
checked my key again. Yes, it really was mine. Clearly they 
had moved somebody else into my room. But where was my 
room now? And where were my belongings?

Hairdressers are constantly servicing clients who come in 
with a picture clipped from a beauty magazine and tell the 
stylist, “This is the look I want ―cut my hair like this.” A 
stylist can just do the cut, take the money and (A) tell / telling
the customer that she got exactly what she wanted. But a 
good stylist knows that what a customer thinks she wants 
(B) is / to be often not what she really wants. The “look” in 
that picture will frequently not be the “look” on this particular 
customer. Good stylists know that their job is not just 
perfectly executing the cut they were asked for. They know 
(C) how / what the face and bone structure and the condition 
of the hair would change the look in the client’s favorite 
picture.

Sometimes athletes need to be allowed to practice their 
skills on their own before they receive feedback. That way 
they can determine what is working and what isn’t and can 
become more ① mindful of their strengths and weaknesses. If 
you attempt to provide assistance when athletes would prefer 
to practice on their own, you may be ② wasting a lot of time 
and breath. When athletes realize that their best efforts are 
producing ③ satisfactory outcomes, they are usually more 
motivated to hear what you have to say. In other words, 
athletes are responsive to assistance when they fail to achieve 
the outcome they were hoping for. A coach’s challenge, then, 
is to remain patient until these and other types of ④ teachable 
moments arise. The reward for such ⑤ patience is athletes 
who are motivated to hear what you have to say and eager to 
incorporate your suggestions.

34. When we are children, our bodies grow automatically. A 
year goes by, and we become taller, stronger, more capable 
of doing new things and facing new challenges. I think many 
people carry into adulthood a subconscious belief that 
mental, spiritual, and emotional growth follows a similar 
pattern. Time goes by, and we simply get better. We’re like 
Charlie Brown in Charles Schulz’s Peanuts comic strip, who 
once said, “I think I’ve discovered the secret of life ― you 
just hang around until you get used to it.” The problem is 
that we don’t improve by simply living. We have to be  
about it. Musician Bruce Springsteen commented, 
“A time comes when you need to stop waiting for the man 
you want to become and start being the man you want to 
be.” No one improves by accident. Personal growth doesn’t 
just happen on its own. [3점]

④ thankful ⑤ self­confident
35. Suppose you are attending an NBA basketball game. If 
everyone is sitting, someone who stands has a superior view. 
Spectators usually can see well if everyone sits or if 
everyone stands. Sitting in seats is more comfortable than 
standing. When there is no cooperation, everyone stands; 
each spectator does what is best for himself or herself given 
the actions of other spectators. If all spectators sit, someone, 
taking what the others will do as a given, will stand. If all 
spectators are standing, then it is best to remain standing. 
With spectator cooperation, the solution is for everyone to 
sit. The problem is that each spectator may be tempted to 
get a better view by standing. The cooperative solution needs 
to be attained ― in this situation,                          . 
① some of them stand up
② each cheers his or her team
③ everyone remains seated
④ all know basketball game rules
⑤ people do what they want
36. Can you recall what you bought for your dinner on the 
same day last month? Probably not. How about this then: 
herdsmen of the Swazi tribe of East Africa are able to 
remember in great detail each cow or bull bought a year 
ago, including who sold the animal, whether it was a bull, a 
cow, or a calf, its age and appearance, and what it was 
bartered for. Impressive, huh? Cattle have tremendous social 
and economic importance in the Swazi tribe. When the 
psychologist Barlett tested these same men on other kinds 
of detail, their memory wasn’t better than the average 
person’s. The conclusion we can draw from this is that we 
tend to  to         us. [3점]
* barter: 물물교환하다
① follow others’ opinions
② stick to what we believe
③ expect our future positively
④ learn better by imitating others

A goal image is a target set in your mind. It is a clear 
image of something you commit yourself to achieving. A

summer day and friends are going to the club to play a 
round of golf, or to the beach to relax. You,    (A)   , are 
going to the gym to work out. Why? Because you have a 
picture in mind of being on the Olympic team, and that goal 
image directs you to the gym and to the training necessary 
to achieve your goal.    (B)   , instead of leaving the office 
after closing a sale and going to the club to play golf, the

Instead, it indicates that a very specific question served 
as a negative stimulus and really bothered the person.
I look for lip compression or disappearing lips during 
interviews or when someone is making a declarative 
statement. ( ① ) This is such a reliable cue that it will 
show up precisely at the moment a difficult question is 
asked. ( ② ) If you see it, that doesn’t necessarily mean the 
person is lying. ( ③ ) For example, if I ask someone, “Are 
you hiding something from me?” and he compresses his lips 
as I ask the question, he is hiding something. ( ④ ) This is 
especially accurate if it is the only time he has concealed or 
compressed his lips during our discussion. ( ⑤ ) It is a 
signal that I need to push further in questioning this person.

One day a pair of cardinals had built a nest in a tree 
right outside the window I faced. Day after day, I 
watched the parent birds feed their newly hatched 
chicks, and I watched the chicks grow. At first I could 
barely spy on them over the nest’s edge, but soon their 
heads stretched way out of the nest. The parent birds 
took turns flying in to fill their begging mouths that got 
bigger and bigger. Then one day the parent birds flew 
close to the nest ─ but didn’t fly in to feed the chicks. 
Instead, each time they neared the nest, and the baby 
birds opened wide to receive their meal, the parent birds 
changed courses and flew away. That was the day the 
little ones left the nest: One by one, they climbed up 
onto the nest’s edge and eventually hopped clear of it 
and onto a branch, all the while coaxed by the mother or 
father, who kept flying by, then flying away. 
What surprised and delighted me was that the parent 
birds did not push the little ones out of the nest. Nor 
did they simply stop coming by, so the chicks would 
have to come out to find food. By flying close and then 
flying away the parent birds                      . It 
seemed clear to me that the little birds finally left the 
nest in order to find their parents, who they could see 
were out there flying around.            * coax: 구슬리다

[43 ~ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
It was a short flight. I’d brought only a carry­on bag, 
so I didn’t have to go to the baggage claim. A quick 
stop by the restroom and I’d head down to the lower 
level, where my friends were going to pick me up. Then 
I saw it. A cute little stuffed dog, sitting all by itself on 
a bench in the main terminal area. Some poor kid was 
probably heartbroken at having lost it. Okay, God, I 
thought, if that dog is still there when I get out of the 
restroom, I’ll trust you to show me what to do with it.

“Mom, we’ve been here for twenty minutes at least! 
Are you sure you’re in the right place?” The tension 
grew in her voice. I touched her gently on the arm. “I 
think I know what’s happening,” I said. “Your mom is at 
arrivals; this is departures.” I pointed at the sign. Relief 
washed over her face. “Mom, I’m sorry, we’re on the 
level for departures. I got mixed up,” she said. “The 
flight was so stressful, and I’ve been running all over 
the airport. Your granddaughter lost her stuffed dog 
somewhere.”

I pulled the stuffed dog out of my bag. The woman 
almost dropped her phone. The little girl squealed and 
gave me a hug. Just then my friends arrived. I waved to 
the woman and her little girl, then climbed into the car. 
“Sorry, we didn’t figure on traffic being quite that bad,” 
one of my friends said as we pulled away from the curb. 
Maybe they were late for a reason.
* squeal: 기쁨의 탄성을 지르다
(D)
Sure enough, the dog was still there, slumped over 
like a tired traveler. I picked it up, stuck it in my bag 
and headed out the door. I’d just gotten outside when 
my cell phone rang. “Becky, we’re going to be late. The 
traffic is really bad,” one of my friends said. “Don’t 
worry,” I said. “I’m outside the departures area. I’ll just 
wait here.” I stood by the curb chatting with my friend 
until I noticed a young woman talking loudly into her 
cell phone, looking frantic, with a little girl at her side.
