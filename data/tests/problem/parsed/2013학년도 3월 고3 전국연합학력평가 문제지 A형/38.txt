Seasickness can occur anytime you board a sea vessel and 
ruin your entire cruise trip. Fortunately, there are effective 
ways to prevent or relieve it. ① As soon as you feel the 
beginning effects of seasickness, go to the deck of the ship 
and stare at the horizon. ② The constant wind and smell of 
the sea can make seasickness worse. ③ Another step you 
can take right away is to eat a small meal, such as 
crackers, some fruit or vegetables. ④ You can also use 
herbal remedies via taste and smell to relieve seasickness. 
⑤ Chamomile or lavender aromatherapy or essential oils have 
a calming effect and help prevent seasickness.
