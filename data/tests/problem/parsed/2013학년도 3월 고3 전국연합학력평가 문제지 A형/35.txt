35. Suppose you are attending an NBA basketball game. If 
everyone is sitting, someone who stands has a superior view. 
Spectators usually can see well if everyone sits or if 
everyone stands. Sitting in seats is more comfortable than 
standing. When there is no cooperation, everyone stands; 
each spectator does what is best for himself or herself given 
the actions of other spectators. If all spectators sit, someone, 
taking what the others will do as a given, will stand. If all 
spectators are standing, then it is best to remain standing. 
With spectator cooperation, the solution is for everyone to 
sit. The problem is that each spectator may be tempted to 
get a better view by standing. The cooperative solution needs 
to be attained ― in this situation,                          . 
① some of them stand up
② each cheers his or her team
