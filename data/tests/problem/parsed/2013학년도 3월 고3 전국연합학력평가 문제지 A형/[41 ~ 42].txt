One day a pair of cardinals had built a nest in a tree 
right outside the window I faced. Day after day, I 
watched the parent birds feed their newly hatched 
chicks, and I watched the chicks grow. At first I could 
barely spy on them over the nest’s edge, but soon their 
heads stretched way out of the nest. The parent birds 
took turns flying in to fill their begging mouths that got 
bigger and bigger. Then one day the parent birds flew 
close to the nest ─ but didn’t fly in to feed the chicks. 
Instead, each time they neared the nest, and the baby 
birds opened wide to receive their meal, the parent birds 
changed courses and flew away. That was the day the 
little ones left the nest: One by one, they climbed up 
onto the nest’s edge and eventually hopped clear of it 
and onto a branch, all the while coaxed by the mother or 
father, who kept flying by, then flying away. 
What surprised and delighted me was that the parent 
birds did not push the little ones out of the nest. Nor 
did they simply stop coming by, so the chicks would 
have to come out to find food. By flying close and then 
flying away the parent birds                      . It 
seemed clear to me that the little birds finally left the 
nest in order to find their parents, who they could see 
were out there flying around.            * coax: 구슬리다
