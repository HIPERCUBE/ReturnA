In Hawaiian, aloha means both “hello” and “good­bye.” ③
Are you ready to say aloha to an old Hawaiian shirt and ④
aloha to a festive new pillow? Now let’s begin making a ⑤
new pillow out of your old shirt.
(A) Now turn the shirt right side out. Begin stuffing it 
through the neck hole. Making sure you fill the arms, 
keep going until the entire pillow is full up to the neck 
opening.
(B) Press the neck down flat, so the opening is closed. Flip 
the collar up and sew straight across so the hole is 
closed. Flip the collar back down again, and now you’ve 
got a cool pillow!
(C) Button the shirt and iron it. Turn it wrong side out, and 42.
sew the armholes closed and the bottom of the shirt 
closed. ①②

One day a pair of cardinals had built a nest in a tree 
right outside the window I faced. Day after day, I 
watched the parent birds feed their newly hatched 
chicks, and I watched the chicks grow. At first I could 
barely spy on them over the nest’s edge, but soon their 
heads stretched way out of the nest. The parent birds 
took turns flying in to fill their begging mouths that got 
bigger and bigger. Then one day the parent birds flew 
close to the nest ─ but didn’t fly in to feed the chicks. 
Instead, each time they neared the nest, and the baby 
birds opened wide to receive their meal, the parent birds 
changed courses and flew away. That was the day the 
little ones left the nest: One by one, they climbed up 
onto the nest’s edge and eventually hopped clear of it 
and onto a branch, all the while coaxed by the mother or 
father, who kept flying by, then flying away. 
What surprised and delighted me was that the parent 
birds did not push the little ones out of the nest. Nor 
did they simply stop coming by, so the chicks would 
have to come out to find food. By flying close and then 
flying away the parent birds                      . It 
seemed clear to me that the little birds finally left the 
nest in order to find their parents, who they could see 
were out there flying around.            * coax: 구슬리다
