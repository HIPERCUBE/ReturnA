A few years ago I met a man named Phil at a
parent-teachers’ organization meeting at my daughter’s
school. As soon as I met him, I remembered something
that my wife had told me about Phil: “He’s a real pain at
meetings.” I quickly saw what she meant. When the
principal was explaining a new reading program, Phil
interrupted and asked how his son would benefit from it.
Later in the meeting, Phil argued with another parent,
unwilling to consider her point of view.
When I got home, I said to my wife, “You were right
about Phil. He’s rude and arrogant.” My wife looked at me
quizzically. “Phil isn’t the one I was telling you about,” she
said. “That was Bill. Phil is actually a very nice guy.”
Sheepishly, I thought back to the meeting and realized that
Phil had probably not interrupted or argued with people
any more than others had. Further, I realized that even
Phil’s interruption of the principal was not so clear-cut.
My interpretation was just that— an unconscious
interpretation of a behavior that was open to many
interpretations.
It is well known that first impressions are powerful,
even when they are based on . What may
not be so obvious is the extent to which the adaptive
unconscious is doing the interpreting. When I saw Phil
interrupt the principal I felt as though I was observing an
objectively rude act. I had no idea that Phil’s behavior
was being interpreted by my adaptive unconscious and
then presented to me as reality. Thus, even though I was
aware of my expectations, I had no idea how much this
expectation colored my interpretation of his behavior.
