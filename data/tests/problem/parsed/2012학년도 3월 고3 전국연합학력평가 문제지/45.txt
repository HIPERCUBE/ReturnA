In one study, people were put one at a time in a
pressure chamber and told that the pressure would slowly
be increased to that of a sixty-foot dive. While inside
the pressure chamber, the subject was asked to perform
two simple visual tasks. One task was to respond to
blinking lights in the center of the subject’s visual field,
and the other involved responding to blinking lights in his
peripheral, or side vision. As expected, each of the
subjects inside the pressure chamber showed all the usual
signs of panic— racing pulse and elevated blood pressure.
These symptoms affected performance in a very distinct
way. Although the people in the pressure chamber
performed just as well as control subjects in an ordinary
room did on the central visual task, those in the pressure
room were twice as likely to miss the lights in their
peripheral vision.
This experiment showed that when the level of (A)
got high, the range of vision became (B) .
(A) (B)
① anxiety ······· wider
② anxiety ······· narrower
③ curiosity ······· wider
④ curiosity ······· narrower
⑤ proficiency ······· narrower

(A)
On the first day of shooting for The 39 Steps in 1935,
Hitchcock’s two leads, Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat,
arrived on the set feeling a little tense. That day (a) they
were to act in one of the movie’s more complex scenes:
playing relative strangers who had gotten handcuffed
together earlier in the plot and, still handcuffed, were forced
to run through the Scottish countryside to escape the film’s
villains. Hitchcock had given them no real sign of how he
wanted (b) them to act the scene. Carroll in particular was
bothered by the director’s behavior.
(B)
This English actress, one of the most elegant film
stars of the period, had spent much of her career in
Hollywood, where directors had treated her like royalty;
Hitchcock, on the other hand, was distant, hard to figure
out. She had decided to play the scene with an air of
dignity, the way she thought a lady would respond to the
situation of being handcuffed to a strange man. When
Hitchcock arrived on the set, he explained the scene to
the two actors, snapped a pair of handcuffs on them, and
proceeded to lead (c) them through the set.
(C)
Hitchcock returned in the afternoon— he had found the
key. Shooting began, but as the actors went to work, it
was hard for (d) them to get over the experience of that
day. Carroll had forgotten all her ideas about how to play
the scene. And yet, despite her and Donat’s anger, the
scene seemed to flow with unexpected naturalness . Now
they knew what it was like to be tied together; they had
felt the awkwardness, so there was no need to act it. It
came from within.
(D)
Then, in the middle of this demonstration, he was
suddenly called away to attend to a technical matter. He
would return soon; they should take a break. He felt in
his pockets for the key to the handcuffs— but no, he
must have mislaid it, and off he hurried, seemingly to
find the key. Hours went by. Donat and Carroll became
increasingly frustrated and embarrassed. While the crew
members were free to go about (e) their business, the
two stars were tied together. They could not even go to
the bathroom. It was humiliating.

[49~50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
A few years ago I met a man named Phil at a
parent-teachers’ organization meeting at my daughter’s
school. As soon as I met him, I remembered something
that my wife had told me about Phil: “He’s a real pain at
meetings.” I quickly saw what she meant. When the
principal was explaining a new reading program, Phil
interrupted and asked how his son would benefit from it.
Later in the meeting, Phil argued with another parent,
unwilling to consider her point of view.
When I got home, I said to my wife, “You were right
about Phil. He’s rude and arrogant.” My wife looked at me
quizzically. “Phil isn’t the one I was telling you about,” she
said. “That was Bill. Phil is actually a very nice guy.”
Sheepishly, I thought back to the meeting and realized that
Phil had probably not interrupted or argued with people
any more than others had. Further, I realized that even
Phil’s interruption of the principal was not so clear-cut.
My interpretation was just that— an unconscious
interpretation of a behavior that was open to many
interpretations.
It is well known that first impressions are powerful,
even when they are based on . What may
not be so obvious is the extent to which the adaptive
unconscious is doing the interpreting. When I saw Phil
interrupt the principal I felt as though I was observing an
objectively rude act. I had no idea that Phil’s behavior
was being interpreted by my adaptive unconscious and
then presented to me as reality. Thus, even though I was
aware of my expectations, I had no idea how much this
expectation colored my interpretation of his behavior.
