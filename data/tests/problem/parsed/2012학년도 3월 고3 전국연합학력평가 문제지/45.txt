blinking lights in the center of the subject’s visual field,
and the other involved responding to blinking lights in his
peripheral, or side vision. As expected, each of the
subjects inside the pressure chamber showed all the usual
signs of panic— racing pulse and elevated blood pressure.
These symptoms affected performance in a very distinct
