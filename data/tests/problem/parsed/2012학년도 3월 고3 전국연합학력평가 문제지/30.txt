30. A few years ago, the animal researcher Maxine Morris
spotted some curious behavior while observing a group of
Asian elephants at Washington Park Zoo in Indiana. At
feeding time, each elephant was given a big bundle of hay.
Morris noticed that a couple of the elephants tended to eat
their own hay quickly, approach their slower-eating
companions, and then start swinging their trunks from side
to side in a seemingly aimless way. To the uninformed, it
appeared that these elephants were just passing the time of
day. However, Morris’s repeated observations suggested that
. Once the trunk-swinging elephants
were sufficiently close to another elephant, they would
suddenly grab some of the uneaten hay and quickly gobble it
up. Elephants are notoriously nearsighted, and so the
slow-eating elephants were often completely unaware of the
theft. [3점]

③ the trunk-swinging ensured their dominant position
④ their trunks were used to warn outside danger
⑤ this behavior masked a dishonest intent
