uniform protects the chef from the food, and it also protects
the food from the chef. In the first case, the long sleeves,
long pants, and double-breasted jacket are a barrier against
burns, spills, and splatters. Sturdy shoes guard against
falling equipment and knives, and they also prevent the chef

grease. In the second case, the long sleeves, double-breasted
jacket, and neckerchief protect the food from a sweating chef.

general’s hat or the distinctive hat of an admiral, makes it
easy to see who is in charge in a crowded kitchen.
