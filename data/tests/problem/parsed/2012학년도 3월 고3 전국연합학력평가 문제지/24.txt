24. 자녀의 행동 교정에 관해 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
There are all kinds of reasons that people fail themselves
and their children when trying to correct inappropriate behavior.
One of them is both serious and obvious to people outside the
“parental unit.” It occurs when one parent interferes with the
other during the correction process. It is hardly ever done
consciously and it almost always happens because of predictable,
inherent differences between partners. And it is essential to
stop. Couples who do not present a united front to their
children not only risk confusing their children, but they also
risk damaging their husband-wife relationships. One parent
becomes the good guy, and the other becomes the bad guy to
the kids. If Dad says “no candy” at the grocery store and Mom
gives in all the time, look out. They’re in for trouble.
