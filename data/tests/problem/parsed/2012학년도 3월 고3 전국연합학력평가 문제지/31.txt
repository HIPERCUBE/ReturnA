There are situations in which the differences between
experts and the public reflect a genuine conflict of values.
(A) , experts often measure risks by the number of
lives lost, while the public tends to draw finer distinctions
between “good deaths” and “bad deaths,” or between random
accidental fatalities and deaths that occur in the course of
voluntary activities such as skiing. These legitimate
distinctions are often ignored in statistics that merely count
cases. The public may have a richer conception of risks than
the experts do. (B) , the view cannot be maintained
that experts’ opinions should be accepted without question
when they conflict with the opinions of other citizens. When
experts and the public disagree on their priorities, each side
must respect the insights and intelligence of the other.
