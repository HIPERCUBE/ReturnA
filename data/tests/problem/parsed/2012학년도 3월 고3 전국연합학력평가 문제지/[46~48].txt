(A)
On the first day of shooting for The 39 Steps in 1935,
Hitchcock’s two leads, Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat,
arrived on the set feeling a little tense. That day (a) they
were to act in one of the movie’s more complex scenes:
playing relative strangers who had gotten handcuffed
together earlier in the plot and, still handcuffed, were forced
to run through the Scottish countryside to escape the film’s
villains. Hitchcock had given them no real sign of how he
wanted (b) them to act the scene. Carroll in particular was
bothered by the director’s behavior.
(B)
This English actress, one of the most elegant film
stars of the period, had spent much of her career in
Hollywood, where directors had treated her like royalty;
Hitchcock, on the other hand, was distant, hard to figure
out. She had decided to play the scene with an air of
dignity, the way she thought a lady would respond to the
situation of being handcuffed to a strange man. When
Hitchcock arrived on the set, he explained the scene to
the two actors, snapped a pair of handcuffs on them, and
proceeded to lead (c) them through the set.
(C)
Hitchcock returned in the afternoon— he had found the
key. Shooting began, but as the actors went to work, it
was hard for (d) them to get over the experience of that
day. Carroll had forgotten all her ideas about how to play
the scene. And yet, despite her and Donat’s anger, the
scene seemed to flow with unexpected naturalness . Now
they knew what it was like to be tied together; they had
felt the awkwardness, so there was no need to act it. It
came from within.
(D)
Then, in the middle of this demonstration, he was
suddenly called away to attend to a technical matter. He
would return soon; they should take a break. He felt in
his pockets for the key to the handcuffs— but no, he
must have mislaid it, and off he hurried, seemingly to
find the key. Hours went by. Donat and Carroll became
increasingly frustrated and embarrassed. While the crew
members were free to go about (e) their business, the
two stars were tied together. They could not even go to
the bathroom. It was humiliating.
