26. When you watch a chase scene in an action movie, your
heart races as well— you may be a little bit scared, or
excited. Your body and mind may react like the experience
is real, as though it is happening to you. That’s what
happens when you visualize: You ask for the experience and
your mind believes that it is real, which creates the
attraction for you to receive in your life. This technique is
favored by many of the world’s great coaches as they
encourage athletes to visualize the actual race or contest
ahead of time. Every stroke, step, and muscle exertion is
vividly imagined. The idea is, when you see it in your mind,
your body will surely follow. And, when the big day comes,
mind and body are so well trained to act in unison that
is virtually assured.
