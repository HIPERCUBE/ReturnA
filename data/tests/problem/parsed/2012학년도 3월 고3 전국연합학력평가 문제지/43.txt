My family moved to a two-story house. One day, my
husband and I discovered that when our kids were in a
certain section of the basement, the sounds of their
playing floated up through the heating vent into our room.
(A) I was shocked. It hadn’t occurred to me that they could
overhear us just as well as we could overhear them,
though this was obvious as soon as they mentioned it.
(B) As I was reading on the couch near that vent, I was
astonished by how clearly I could hear every word they
were saying. For a few minutes, I listened intently. But
then I felt sneaky.
(C) So when they scrambled up the stairs, demanding lunch,
I told them the secret. I thought they’d be surprised, but
they weren’t. They just shrugged their shoulders. “We
know,” they said. “We hear you and Daddy talking, too.”
