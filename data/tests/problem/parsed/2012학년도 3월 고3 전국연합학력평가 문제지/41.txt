41. In 2007, the Ecuadorean government announced that it
intended to protect the oilfields located in the Yasuni
Rainforest. It’s home to one of the world’s largest undeveloped
oil reserves— close to one billion barrels’ worth. Not extracting
that oil will prevent the release of an estimated 400 million
tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Taking a stand for the
Yasuni oilfield’s protection is a bold move, considering that
about seventy percent of Ecuador’s income is from oil. To
accomplish the plan, they asked the international community to pay
them half of the income that would result from the extraction, or
$350 million a year for a decade. This is a big deal: an
innovative idea that other developing countries could employ to
protect their own resources and help combat climate change.
