39. As a counselor, I often use the North Star as a metaphor.
I tell clients: You are in a boat that is being tossed around
by the winds of the world. The voices of your parents, your
teachers, your friends, and the media can blow you east,
then west, then back again. To stay on course you must
follow your own North Star, your sense of who you truly
are. Only by orienting north can you keep from being blown
all over the sea. True freedom has more to do with
following the North Star than with going whichever way the
wind blows. Sometimes it seems like freedom is blowing
with the winds of the day, but that kind of freedom is really
an illusion. It turns your boat in circles. Freedom is sailing
toward your dreams.
