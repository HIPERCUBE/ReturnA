40. “It’s great, it’s amazing, it’s so cool....” Can you tell from
these whether it’s your coworker telling you about her new
car, or your teenager son describing the new telephone he
wants you to get him? I’m sure you can’t. We’ll believe your
experience is amazing only if you tell us why. We need to
know―what did you see? Hear? Touch? Taste? Smell? How
did it make you feel? What did it remind you of? Notice
when others are just saying, “great,” “amazing,” “bad,”
“terrible.” Once you’ve spent some time observing others,
you will want to change your own bad habits of using these
meaningless words. Now, let’s practice: How was your day?
Your sandwiches? The movie? Instead of blurting out, “It
was great,” try to answer these questions as vividly as
possible. Once you learn to do that, people will start
referring to you as a master storyteller.
