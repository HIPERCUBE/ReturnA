35. Try an interesting experiment. Call a friend and say, “I’m
mad at you” in a tone that conveys that you aren’t― the
tone you would use if the next sentence were something
like, “You didn’t tell me about your promotion.” Then ask
your friend if she thought you were truly angry. The answer
will probably be no. Now imagine what would have happened
if you had sent that friend an email that read, “I’m mad at
you.” Our voice is a very subtle instrument and can convey
every shade and nuance. An executive recruiter said she
never uses email to check references. When she’s on the
phone, a pause or a strained voice in response to a question
about work habits can hint at a more complicated answer
than the one she’s been given.
