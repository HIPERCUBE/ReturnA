You can learn the success secrets of the greatest people
who ever lived. The lives of famous people have been
recorded in biographies and are ready for you to read and
research. The lives of great government leaders,
businesspeople, and humanitarians are there. You will read
about successes and triumphs. You will also learn how many
times champions lose on their way to winning. In reading
biographies, you may come to the startling conclusion that
you are not very different from those great people. You may
conclude, “Hey, I can do that.” You can make your life
significant. Biographies help show the way. You only have to
go to the library, bookstores, or surf the Internet.

Nineteenth-century inventors often found themselves
cheated and spent much of their lives fighting costly
court battles. Consider the fate of poor Elias Howe. In
1846, ① this young Boston native produced the first
workable sewing machine. The trouble was that no one
wanted it. Depressed by his failure, Howe traveled to
England, where ② he hoped that the invention might be
given a warmer reception. It was not. After two terrible
years, ③ the frustrated inventor had to work his passage
home on a merchant ship. Arriving penniless in Boston, he
discovered that in his absence a man called Isaac Singer
had stolen ④ his patent and set up a sewing machine
factory. Howe took Singer to court, where two things
became clear: Singer was a thief, but ⑤ he was so rich that
he could afford to hire the sharpest lawyers. It was only
after a lengthy fight that Howe could get royalties from
Singer.

We do not hear with our eyes, but sometimes it almost
seems as if we do. An environment-agency official tells a
surprising incident about some people ①who lived in an
apartment building close to a busy state highway. The
families were made ②miserably by the noise, and they
complained to the city government. City officials went to the
state capital again and again to ask that something ③ be
done about quieting the highway noise. They were put off
repeatedly. At last the city officials had an idea. They
planted a single row of trees in front of the apartment
house. The trees made hardly any difference in the amount
of noise, but they ④ did block the view of the highway.
After that, there were very ⑤ few complaints from the
people in the building.

The observation that old windows are often thicker at the
bottom than at the top (A) is / are often offered as supporting
evidence for the view that glass flows over a time scale of
centuries. However, this assumption is incorrect; once
solidified, glass does not flow anymore. The reason for the
observation is (B) that / what in the past, making uniformly
flat glass was almost impossible. The technique used to make
panes of glass was to spin molten glass so as to create a
round, mostly flat plate. This plate was then cut to fit a
window. However, the edges of the disk became thicker as
the glass spun. When (C) installing / installed in a window
frame, the glass would be placed thicker side down for the
sake of stability. * molten: 녹은, 용해된

22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Rice paddies are “built,” not “opened up” the way a wheat
field is. You don’t just clear the trees, underbrush, and
stones, and then plow. ① Rice paddies are carved into
mountainsides in an elaborate series of terraces, or
painstakingly constructed from marshland and river plains.
②The crops turn a magical green, and by the time of the
first harvest, the land becomes an unending sea of yellow.
③They have to be irrigated, so a complex system of
channels must be dug from the nearest water source. ④The
paddy itself, meanwhile, has to have a hard clay floor;
otherwise the water will simply seep into the ground. ⑤And
the paddy has to be carefully engineered so that it will drain
properly and also keep the plants submerged at the optimum
level. * rice paddy: 논
23. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
After five hours of rock climbing, we six finally stood on
top, shaking hands. It was a big moment. As I grasped the
hands of my companions, one by one, I felt I was being
welcomed into a special club: the brotherhood of the rope.
Having missed breakfast we turned eagerly to lunch, breaking
out peanut butter sandwiches, apples, and cookies. As we sat
on the summit, gobbling the food, we surveyed our domain
like kings— the lakes, the rolling granite, the meadows and
forests, all spread out beneath us. Beautiful spires rose on
all sides. This was the wonderland of the High Sierra and we
were in the heart of it. We weren’t just visitors or mere
sightseers. We had struggled and climbed a mountain. We had
earned the right to be part of all this. * spire: 뾰족한 봉우리
① pleased and proud ② eager and envious
③ scared and desperate ④ curious and grateful
⑤ surprised and confused
24. 자녀의 행동 교정에 관해 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
There are all kinds of reasons that people fail themselves
and their children when trying to correct inappropriate behavior.
One of them is both serious and obvious to people outside the
“parental unit.” It occurs when one parent interferes with the
other during the correction process. It is hardly ever done
consciously and it almost always happens because of predictable,
inherent differences between partners. And it is essential to
stop. Couples who do not present a united front to their
children not only risk confusing their children, but they also
risk damaging their husband-wife relationships. One parent
becomes the good guy, and the other becomes the bad guy to
the kids. If Dad says “no candy” at the grocery store and Mom
gives in all the time, look out. They’re in for trouble.
① 부부가 동일한 태도를 취해야 한다.

25. Psychologists have spent years trying to discover the answer
to the question, “What makes innovators different?” In one of
the most thorough examinations of the subject, Harvard
researchers spent six years and interviewed three thousand
executives to find out. Their conclusions are interesting, but the
investigators could have saved themselves a lot of time by
simply asking Steve Jobs. According to the Harvard research,
the number one skill that separates innovators from noncreative
professionals is “associating”: the ability to successfully connect
seemingly unrelated questions, problems, or ideas from different
fields. “The more diverse our experience and knowledge, the
more connections the brain can make. Fresh inputs trigger new
associations; for some, these lead to .”
① novel ideas ② scientific proofs
③ moral lessons ④ cultural diversity
⑤ mistaken conclusions
26. When you watch a chase scene in an action movie, your
heart races as well— you may be a little bit scared, or
excited. Your body and mind may react like the experience
is real, as though it is happening to you. That’s what
happens when you visualize: You ask for the experience and
your mind believes that it is real, which creates the
attraction for you to receive in your life. This technique is
favored by many of the world’s great coaches as they
encourage athletes to visualize the actual race or contest
ahead of time. Every stroke, step, and muscle exertion is
vividly imagined. The idea is, when you see it in your mind,
your body will surely follow. And, when the big day comes,
mind and body are so well trained to act in unison that
is virtually assured.
① fierce competition ② group cooperation
③ ultimate performance ④ public reputation
⑤ visual observation
27. The other day, while riding in an airplane flying at 30,000
feet, I had a sudden realization. I knew nothing about the
pilot, beyond the sound of his voice. I couldn’t even
remember his name because I had not been paying close
attention when he made his welcoming announcement. Yet I
was there, feeling comfortable and safe. I realized that I
was lacking a lot of other important information about the
situation I was in. Who were the mechanics that checked the
plane before it took off? Who had put in the fuel? Who had
performed the routine maintenance? Who were the air traffic
controllers that were watching the little spot on their
tracking screens, the little spot that contained my life and
the lives of my fellow passengers? The awareness of
really came home to me.
① what impact air travel could have on us
② how many people overcame the fear of flying
③ how much trust we put in complete strangers
④ what great new ideas we got from traveling
⑤ how fast technology changed our lives
28. Our sense of smell is particularly vulnerable to outside
influence. A team of scientists at Oxford has shown that a
simple word label can profoundly alter what we think our
noses are telling us. When an experimental subject is given
odorless air to smell but told he is smelling cheddar cheese,
his olfactory areas light up in hungry anticipation. But when
the same air arrives with a “body-odor” label, the subject
unwittingly shuts down the smell areas of his brain.
Although the sensation hasn’t changed— it’s still just purified
air— the mind has completely revised its olfactory response.
We unknowingly deceive ourselves. In reality, our olfactory
sensations . * olfactory: 후각의
① control our overall mood
② bring about old memories
③ keep us from enjoying food
④ are influenced by their context
⑤ compensate for the loss of sight
29. During World War II, a physician named Henry Beecher
was stationed on Italy’s Anzio beachhead, where he treated
201 wounded soldiers. In recording his treatments, he
observed that only three-quarters of the wounded soldiers
requested pain medication, although they had suffered serious
injuries ranging from penetrating wounds to extensive surgical
wounds. Beecher compared these observations to treatments
of his civilian patients who had been hurt in all kinds of
accidents, and he found that people with civilian injuries
requested more medication than the soldiers injured in battle
did. Beecher concluded that there was no direct relationship
between the severity of the wound and the intensity of pain.
He was among the first to propose that greatly
determines the level of pain. For soldiers, the wound meant
surviving combat and returning home.
* beachhead: (군사) 해안 교두보
① the kind of drug used for treatment
② the previous experience of severe pain
③ the meaning our minds give to an injury
④ the way caregivers interact with patients
⑤ the quality of medical information given to patients
30. A few years ago, the animal researcher Maxine Morris
spotted some curious behavior while observing a group of
Asian elephants at Washington Park Zoo in Indiana. At
feeding time, each elephant was given a big bundle of hay.
Morris noticed that a couple of the elephants tended to eat
their own hay quickly, approach their slower-eating
companions, and then start swinging their trunks from side
to side in a seemingly aimless way. To the uninformed, it
appeared that these elephants were just passing the time of
day. However, Morris’s repeated observations suggested that
. Once the trunk-swinging elephants
were sufficiently close to another elephant, they would
suddenly grab some of the uneaten hay and quickly gobble it
up. Elephants are notoriously nearsighted, and so the
slow-eating elephants were often completely unaware of the
theft. [3점]
① this behavior often turned into a fierce fight for mates
② their friendly nature was hidden behind this behavior
③ the trunk-swinging ensured their dominant position
④ their trunks were used to warn outside danger
⑤ this behavior masked a dishonest intent

There are situations in which the differences between
experts and the public reflect a genuine conflict of values.
(A) , experts often measure risks by the number of
lives lost, while the public tends to draw finer distinctions
between “good deaths” and “bad deaths,” or between random
accidental fatalities and deaths that occur in the course of
voluntary activities such as skiing. These legitimate
distinctions are often ignored in statistics that merely count
cases. The public may have a richer conception of risks than
the experts do. (B) , the view cannot be maintained
that experts’ opinions should be accepted without question
when they conflict with the opinions of other citizens. When
experts and the public disagree on their priorities, each side
must respect the insights and intelligence of the other.

Girls usually agreed that wearing a uniform to school
every day ① reduced their daily stresses. Not having to
worry about what to wear meant one less decision to
make every morning. Many of them also felt that the
uniform ② enhanced school spirit and solidarity. They could
feel like they belong to a community. Moreover, the
uniforms ③ eliminated their individuality. If you want to
know a thousand and one ways to ④modify a school
uniform, just ask the girls who wear it: ties can be worn
loosely or tight, and skirts can be raised or lowered in any
of a half-dozen ways. Then there are accessories— a gray
region in the dress code, but an entire subcontinent in the
world of women’s apparel. There are a million ⑤ options in
the domain of hairpins, watches, and bags alone.

34. The chef always wears a uniform in the kitchen. The
uniform protects the chef from the food, and it also protects
the food from the chef. In the first case, the long sleeves,
long pants, and double-breasted jacket are a barrier against
burns, spills, and splatters. Sturdy shoes guard against
falling equipment and knives, and they also prevent the chef
from slipping on floors made slippery by spilled food and
grease. In the second case, the long sleeves, double-breasted
jacket, and neckerchief protect the food from a sweating chef.
The tall white chef’s hat keeps the chef’s hair out of his
eyes and out of the food, and also, like the stars on a
general’s hat or the distinctive hat of an admiral, makes it
easy to see who is in charge in a crowded kitchen.
① hidden dangers in the kitchen
② the functions of the chef’s uniform
③ the value of a well-organized kitchen
④ the process of inventing a new dish
⑤ the do’s and don’ts in the kitchen
35. Try an interesting experiment. Call a friend and say, “I’m
mad at you” in a tone that conveys that you aren’t― the
tone you would use if the next sentence were something
like, “You didn’t tell me about your promotion.” Then ask
your friend if she thought you were truly angry. The answer
will probably be no. Now imagine what would have happened
if you had sent that friend an email that read, “I’m mad at
you.” Our voice is a very subtle instrument and can convey
every shade and nuance. An executive recruiter said she
never uses email to check references. When she’s on the
phone, a pause or a strained voice in response to a question
about work habits can hint at a more complicated answer
than the one she’s been given.
① why expressing negative feelings is important
② voice as a subtle instrument in communication
③ the relationship between voice and personality
④ how to be successful in a job interview
⑤ how to interpret others’ emotions

42. Some people work long hours even at very high levels of
income. Have they got their priorities right? Most people
would agree that, at a low level of income, an increase in
income is likely to improve your quality of life, even if it
means longer working hours. At this level, even if you have
to work longer in your factory, higher income is likely to
bring a higher overall quality of life by improving your
health through better food, heating, hygiene and healthcare
and by reducing the physical demands of household work
through more household appliances. However, above a certain
level of income, the relative value of material consumption
in relation to leisure time is diminished, so earning a higher
income at the cost of working longer hours may reduce the
quality of your life.

My family moved to a two-story house. One day, my

In one study, people were put one at a time in a
pressure chamber and told that the pressure would slowly
be increased to that of a sixty-foot dive. While inside
the pressure chamber, the subject was asked to perform
two simple visual tasks. One task was to respond to
blinking lights in the center of the subject’s visual field,
and the other involved responding to blinking lights in his
peripheral, or side vision. As expected, each of the
subjects inside the pressure chamber showed all the usual
signs of panic— racing pulse and elevated blood pressure.
These symptoms affected performance in a very distinct
way. Although the people in the pressure chamber
performed just as well as control subjects in an ordinary
room did on the central visual task, those in the pressure
room were twice as likely to miss the lights in their
peripheral vision.
This experiment showed that when the level of (A)

(A)
On the first day of shooting for The 39 Steps in 1935,
Hitchcock’s two leads, Madeleine Carroll and Robert Donat,
arrived on the set feeling a little tense. That day (a) they
were to act in one of the movie’s more complex scenes:
playing relative strangers who had gotten handcuffed
together earlier in the plot and, still handcuffed, were forced
to run through the Scottish countryside to escape the film’s
villains. Hitchcock had given them no real sign of how he
wanted (b) them to act the scene. Carroll in particular was
bothered by the director’s behavior.
(B)
This English actress, one of the most elegant film
stars of the period, had spent much of her career in
Hollywood, where directors had treated her like royalty;
Hitchcock, on the other hand, was distant, hard to figure
out. She had decided to play the scene with an air of
dignity, the way she thought a lady would respond to the
situation of being handcuffed to a strange man. When
Hitchcock arrived on the set, he explained the scene to
the two actors, snapped a pair of handcuffs on them, and
proceeded to lead (c) them through the set.
(C)
Hitchcock returned in the afternoon— he had found the
key. Shooting began, but as the actors went to work, it
was hard for (d) them to get over the experience of that
day. Carroll had forgotten all her ideas about how to play
the scene. And yet, despite her and Donat’s anger, the
scene seemed to flow with unexpected naturalness . Now
they knew what it was like to be tied together; they had
felt the awkwardness, so there was no need to act it. It
came from within.
(D)
Then, in the middle of this demonstration, he was
suddenly called away to attend to a technical matter. He
would return soon; they should take a break. He felt in
his pockets for the key to the handcuffs— but no, he
must have mislaid it, and off he hurried, seemingly to
find the key. Hours went by. Donat and Carroll became
increasingly frustrated and embarrassed. While the crew
members were free to go about (e) their business, the

[49~50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
A few years ago I met a man named Phil at a
parent-teachers’ organization meeting at my daughter’s
school. As soon as I met him, I remembered something
that my wife had told me about Phil: “He’s a real pain at
meetings.” I quickly saw what she meant. When the
principal was explaining a new reading program, Phil
interrupted and asked how his son would benefit from it.
Later in the meeting, Phil argued with another parent,
unwilling to consider her point of view.
When I got home, I said to my wife, “You were right
about Phil. He’s rude and arrogant.” My wife looked at me
quizzically. “Phil isn’t the one I was telling you about,” she
said. “That was Bill. Phil is actually a very nice guy.”
Sheepishly, I thought back to the meeting and realized that
Phil had probably not interrupted or argued with people
any more than others had. Further, I realized that even
Phil’s interruption of the principal was not so clear-cut.
My interpretation was just that— an unconscious
interpretation of a behavior that was open to many
interpretations.
It is well known that first impressions are powerful,
even when they are based on . What may
not be so obvious is the extent to which the adaptive
unconscious is doing the interpreting. When I saw Phil
interrupt the principal I felt as though I was observing an
objectively rude act. I had no idea that Phil’s behavior
was being interpreted by my adaptive unconscious and
then presented to me as reality. Thus, even though I was
aware of my expectations, I had no idea how much this
expectation colored my interpretation of his behavior.
