We do not hear with our eyes, but sometimes it almost
seems as if we do. An environment-agency official tells a
surprising incident about some people ①who lived in an
apartment building close to a busy state highway. The
families were made ②miserably by the noise, and they
complained to the city government. City officials went to the
state capital again and again to ask that something ③ be
done about quieting the highway noise. They were put off
repeatedly. At last the city officials had an idea. They
planted a single row of trees in front of the apartment
house. The trees made hardly any difference in the amount
of noise, but they ④ did block the view of the highway.
After that, there were very ⑤ few complaints from the
people in the building.
