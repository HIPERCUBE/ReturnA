29. During World War II, a physician named Henry Beecher
was stationed on Italy’s Anzio beachhead, where he treated
201 wounded soldiers. In recording his treatments, he
observed that only three-quarters of the wounded soldiers
requested pain medication, although they had suffered serious
injuries ranging from penetrating wounds to extensive surgical
wounds. Beecher compared these observations to treatments
of his civilian patients who had been hurt in all kinds of
accidents, and he found that people with civilian injuries
requested more medication than the soldiers injured in battle
did. Beecher concluded that there was no direct relationship
between the severity of the wound and the intensity of pain.
He was among the first to propose that greatly
determines the level of pain. For soldiers, the wound meant
surviving combat and returning home.
