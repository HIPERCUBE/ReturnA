27. The other day, while riding in an airplane flying at 30,000
feet, I had a sudden realization. I knew nothing about the
pilot, beyond the sound of his voice. I couldn’t even
remember his name because I had not been paying close
attention when he made his welcoming announcement. Yet I
was there, feeling comfortable and safe. I realized that I
was lacking a lot of other important information about the
situation I was in. Who were the mechanics that checked the
plane before it took off? Who had put in the fuel? Who had
performed the routine maintenance? Who were the air traffic
controllers that were watching the little spot on their
tracking screens, the little spot that contained my life and
the lives of my fellow passengers? The awareness of
really came home to me.
