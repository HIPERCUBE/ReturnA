One of the most important things to remember before a race
is to eat the right foods. Here is my lesson for you. The night
before one of my marathons, I was struck by an uncontrollable
need for apple butter. I satisfied the hunger that evening but
paid a heavy price the next day; the apple butter forced me to
make several stops during the marathon. You can bet that I
never ate apple butter again before a race. Instead, I
concentrate on foods that are part of my normal diet such as
pasta and rice: foods that fuel my muscles. You must certainly
have similar foods that you eat every day. These foods are the
ones you should concentrate on before a race.
