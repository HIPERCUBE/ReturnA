34. Often, people report that a good cry can make them feel better
and more at peace. In one survey, 85% of women and 73% of
men reported feeling less sad or angry after crying. As a result of
this kind of information, a scientist conducted a research to
discover the chemical makeup of tears. He found that the tears
caused by sadness contained more total protein than those caused
by cutting a raw onion. He proposes that the emotionally based
tears contained high levels of cortisol, which is the primary
hormone released during stressful situations. This suggests that
we may be literally releasing toxins from our system when we
cry, and that crying itself may support our overall wellbeing.
