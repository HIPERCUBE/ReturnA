37. SOFIA에 대한 다음글의내용과일치하지않는것은?
The SOFIA is a Boeing 747 jet developed jointly by NASA
and the German Aerospace Center. Instead of passenger seats,
the plane houses a powerful, 17-ton telescope in the rear
section of the aircraft. With four high-powered engines, SOFIA
can cruise at 520 miles per hour and reach an altitude of about
40,000 feet. Specialized modifications to the plane allow the
smooth ride needed for precise observations. There will be
about 8 hours of observing time on each flight. SOFIA is
expected to have a lifetime of 20 years and observe star-forming
regions and nearby galaxies.
