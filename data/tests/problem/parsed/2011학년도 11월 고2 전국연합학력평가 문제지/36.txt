36. chambered nautilus에 대한다음글의내용과일치하는것은?
The curious-looking chambered nautilus is considered to be a
living fossil. This animal reproduces by laying eggs. When a
young chambered nautilus first hatches from its egg, it is about
an inch in diameter and has a shell with seven chambers. The
average lifespan of the chambered nautilus is believed to be
about 20 years. It is thought to rely mainly on its sense of
smell when searching for food. Their eyesight is very poor
because their eyes contain no lenses. Instead, there is only a
tiny hole to allow light into the eye. Unfortunately, its
population is on the decline due to the harvesting of their
beautiful shells.
