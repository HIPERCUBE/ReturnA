[48 ~ 50]다음글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
(A)
Marilyn Tina was working as a manager overseeing the
operations of 320 stores. One day a friend told her FLY, one
of the biggest multinational corporations, was planning to
open its own stores and CEO Jennifer Lawrence was
interested in hiring her to oversee the project. Because
Marilyn thought that working for FLY would be a great
opportunity, (a) she did some research prior to her meeting.
(B)
Then (b) she flew back to California wondering if she had
done the right thing. She felt that she had probably lost any
chance of getting a job there, but she also felt good about
having told the truth. Two weeks later, Jennifer called and
told her (c) she had reconsidered what Marilyn had said and
agreed with her assessment of the situation. She offered
Marilyn the job as vice president of clothing and accessories.
(C)
Marilyn’s dilemma was that her desire to work for FLY was
in conflict with her professional judgment about the products.
(d) She was afraid that if she told Jennifer what she
discovered, she wouldn’t get the job. When she met with
Jennifer, she hesitated at first, but finally told Jennifer that
she thought the stores would fail because the products would
not reflect what FLY stood for.
(D)
As she did her research, (e) she found out that FLY’s
products had been far behind comsumer’s demand for FLY
brand. FLY had simply bought stock goods and just put its
own label on them. The company bought clothing from
different manufacturers without any consistent standards in
size, quality, or color. It didn’t reflect the brand of FLY.
