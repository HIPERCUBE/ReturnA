42. The carpark next to our library uses a pay-and-display
system. You feed coins into a meter and then get a ticket for
one to two hours to display on your dashboard. A couple of
months ago, a woman offered me her ticket as she was leaving;
the ticket still had one hour remaining. What a bonus: I didn’t
have to look for some spare coins. On the next visit, I noticed
that the parking fairy had left a ticket with about 45 minutes
remaining in the slot of the machine for some lucky person to
use. The parking fairy has inspired me to do the same
whenever I can. It’s a lovely feeling knowing that you could be
brightening up someone’s day with such a small gesture.
