The human brain is not particularly sensitive to the
absolute magnitude of stimulation, but it is extraordinarily
sensitive to the differences. For example, if you are
blindfolded and asked to hold a wooden block in your hand,
would you be able to tell if a pack of gum is placed on top of
the block? The right answer is “It depends,” and what it
depends on is the weight of the block. If the block weighed
only 30 grams, then you’d immediately notice the 500
percent increase in weight when a 150-gram pack of gum is
added. But if the block weighed 5 kilograms, then you’d
never notice the 0.03 percent increase in weight. There is no
answer to the question “Can people detect 150 grams?” because
brains do not detect grams but they detect . And
the same is true for just about every physical property of an
object. Our sensitivity to the relative is not limited to
physical properties such as weight, brightness, or volume. It
extends to subjective properties, such as value, goodness,
and worth as well.
