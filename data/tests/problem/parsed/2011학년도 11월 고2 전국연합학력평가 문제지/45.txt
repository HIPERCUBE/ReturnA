When our ancestors began farming and herding, they gave
up the advantages of mobility. It’s true that domesticating
sheep, cattle, or pigs does not bind you as tightly to one
place as planting grain does. But it certainly becomes more
costly to flee an enemy, who can steal your stores of food.
So the beginning of agriculture meant that our ancestors
would band together in larger groups than they had
previously been used to. Hunter-gatherer families could
easily split up once food got scarce or rivalries and tensions
grew too difficult to manage, but early farmers knew that
splitting up had become a far more dangerous thing to do. It
became more than ever essential to learn to live with others
and to manage conflict rather than to escape it.
At the beginning of the (A) for agriculture, our
ancestors needed to be (B) to protect their food
from enemies.
(A) (B)
① irrigation …… united
② irrigation …… armed
③ movement …… armed
④ settlement …… united
⑤ settlement …… warned

The human brain is not particularly sensitive to the
absolute magnitude of stimulation, but it is extraordinarily
sensitive to the differences. For example, if you are
blindfolded and asked to hold a wooden block in your hand,
would you be able to tell if a pack of gum is placed on top of
the block? The right answer is “It depends,” and what it
depends on is the weight of the block. If the block weighed
only 30 grams, then you’d immediately notice the 500
percent increase in weight when a 150-gram pack of gum is
added. But if the block weighed 5 kilograms, then you’d
never notice the 0.03 percent increase in weight. There is no
answer to the question “Can people detect 150 grams?” because
brains do not detect grams but they detect . And
the same is true for just about every physical property of an
object. Our sensitivity to the relative is not limited to
physical properties such as weight, brightness, or volume. It
extends to subjective properties, such as value, goodness,
and worth as well.

(A)
Marilyn Tina was working as a manager overseeing the
operations of 320 stores. One day a friend told her FLY, one
of the biggest multinational corporations, was planning to
open its own stores and CEO Jennifer Lawrence was
interested in hiring her to oversee the project. Because
Marilyn thought that working for FLY would be a great
opportunity, (a) she did some research prior to her meeting.
(B)
Then (b) she flew back to California wondering if she had
done the right thing. She felt that she had probably lost any
chance of getting a job there, but she also felt good about
having told the truth. Two weeks later, Jennifer called and
told her (c) she had reconsidered what Marilyn had said and
agreed with her assessment of the situation. She offered
Marilyn the job as vice president of clothing and accessories.
(C)
Marilyn’s dilemma was that her desire to work for FLY was
in conflict with her professional judgment about the products.
(d) She was afraid that if she told Jennifer what she
discovered, she wouldn’t get the job. When she met with
Jennifer, she hesitated at first, but finally told Jennifer that
she thought the stores would fail because the products would
not reflect what FLY stood for.
(D)
As she did her research, (e) she found out that FLY’s
products had been far behind comsumer’s demand for FLY
brand. FLY had simply bought stock goods and just put its
own label on them. The company bought clothing from
different manufacturers without any consistent standards in
size, quality, or color. It didn’t reflect the brand of FLY.
