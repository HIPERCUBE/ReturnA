39. It’s natural to believe that external events upset you. When
you’re mad at someone, you automatically make them the cause
of all your bad feelings. You say, “You’re annoying me!” When
you think like this, you’re actually fooling yourself because
other people really cannot make you angry. Some pushy
teenagers might crowd in front of you in line at the movie
theater. Your boyfriend might always show up late for dates in
spite of knowing how important promptness is to you. No matter
how unfair others might appear to you, they do not, never did,
and never will upset you. The bitter truth is that you’re the one
who’s creating every last ounce of the anger you experience.
