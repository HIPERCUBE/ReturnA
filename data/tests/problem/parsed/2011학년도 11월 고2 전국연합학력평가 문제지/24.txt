music, both in duration and in choice of instrument. The
musical score should do no more than is necessary to perform
its proper function clearly and simply. However, because of

smaller combinations can be more powerful in their effect on
the film as a whole. The proper amount of music must match
the nature of the picture itself. [3점]
