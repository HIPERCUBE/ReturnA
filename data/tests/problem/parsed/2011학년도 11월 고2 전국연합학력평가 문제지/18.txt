I am deeply shocked to see that there was no mention of the
floods in Pakistan. I expected to see some mention of this
catastrophe in your magazine which has millions of readers
around the world. Millions of dollars have been donated up till
now. Even several celebrities have visited the country to create
awareness and help the victims. Moreover, many notable
organizations from around the world are working actively to
gather the helping hands from big-hearted people. I ask you to
publish something appropriate about this tragedy in your
magazine. I believe this will encourage your readers to check
out what they can do to help the victims.
