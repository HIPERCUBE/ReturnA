40. Say you’re thinking of writing a complaint letter. Your first
impulse may be to start it by spinning out your sad story, event
by event. But what’s your real goal here? If you’re like most
people, you want the wrong made right. Perhaps you even want
an apology. That’s where your letter should start: asking for
what you want. After all, this is what you most need to
communicate, and this is what the reader of your letter first
wants to know! If you were in his or her place, would you
really want to blindly start reading a list of sad events? You’d
want to first know why this person was writing to you; then
perhaps you’d be ready for the details.
