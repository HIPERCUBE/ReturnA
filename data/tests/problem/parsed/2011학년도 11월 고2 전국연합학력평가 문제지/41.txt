41. None of your ideas will change the world if you keep them
inside of your head. At some point you will have to persuade
someone else to invest, buy, participate, or join. You would be
surprised at how many people fail to understand the importance
of this step. I often wonder how many truly revolutionary ideas
are never given a chance to succeed because the brilliant mind
that produced the idea could not tell the story behind it. Don’t let
poor communication damage the ultimate success of your ideas.
