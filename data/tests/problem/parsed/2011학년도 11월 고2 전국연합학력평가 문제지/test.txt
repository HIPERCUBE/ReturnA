I am deeply shocked to see that there was no mention of the
floods in Pakistan. I expected to see some mention of this
catastrophe in your magazine which has millions of readers
around the world. Millions of dollars have been donated up till
now. Even several celebrities have visited the country to create
awareness and help the victims. Moreover, many notable
organizations from around the world are working actively to
gather the helping hands from big-hearted people. I ask you to
publish something appropriate about this tragedy in your

out what they can do to help the victims.

One of the most important things to remember before a race
is to eat the right foods. Here is my lesson for you. The night
before one of my marathons, I was struck by an uncontrollable
need for apple butter. I satisfied the hunger that evening but
paid a heavy price the next day; the apple butter forced me to
make several stops during the marathon. You can bet that I
never ate apple butter again before a race. Instead, I
concentrate on foods that are part of my normal diet such as
pasta and rice: foods that fuel my muscles. You must certainly
have similar foods that you eat every day. These foods are the
ones you should concentrate on before a race.

24. Generally speaking, is a great virtue in film
music, both in duration and in choice of instrument. The
musical score should do no more than is necessary to perform
its proper function clearly and simply. However, because of
some irresistible temptation to dress up scenes with music
whether they need it or not, normal films usually end up with
too much music rather than not enough. The Hollywood
tendency seems to be toward large orchestras, even though
smaller combinations can be more powerful in their effect on
the film as a whole. The proper amount of music must match
the nature of the picture itself. [3점]

25. When you sit down to begin a piece of writing, your first aim
ought to be to . You just make a note of
everything that comes to your mind on the subject. You do not
have to worry at all about whether your stuff is connected
logically. Just play with your subject and do no fine detail
work. I believe many writing difficulties come about because
people think writing is a neat and clean endeavor. I don’t mean
that you have to go out of your way to make your writing
disorganized or uncommunicative. I’m just saying that you need
to control your worry in the first part of the writing process.
Start from making a sketch rather than a finished oil painting.

26. Students join clubs and participate in school activities for a
number of very good reasons. They have interests they wish to
pursue and skills they wish to develop. Sometimes, especially
in high schools, students participate in extracurricular activities
because it looks good on a college application or resume. But
the underlying reason for joining just about all school activities
is to . Meeting new people who

27. If you walk up and down a pebbly beach, you will notice that
the pebbles are not arranged at random. The smaller pebbles
usually tend to be found in a separate zone running along the
length of the beach. The larger ones are collected in a different
zone. The pebbles have been sorted, arranged, and selected. We
might explain that the arranging was really done by the blind
forces of physics, in this case the action of waves. The waves
have no purposes or intentions. They just randomly throw the
pebbles around, and big pebbles and small pebbles respond
differently to this treatment, so they end up at different levels of
the beach. has come out of disorder.

28. A photographer may feel he has to travel great distances in
order to find an unusual story. Stories are, however, a lot
closer at hand than most people realize. Interesting stories
surround us. Dig beneath the surface of any common person
and the stories will appear. A photographer’s resources could
be people and every aspect of their lives: their environment,
their habits, their families, etc. Thus, the photographer should
strive to explore and understand those things rather than look
for something special. In other words, he should aim to find out

29. According to a memory research, you are less likely to
remember the smaller, non-humorous details. Humans in general
are quite good at recalling unusual or unexpected events, and a
perfect example of this is when you .
For example, if one of your colleagues turned up to a serious
business meeting dressed as Mickey Mouse, it’s likely you’d
remember the funny incident a month later, but probably you
would forget about what your other colleagues were wearing,
what you had for lunch that day, and perhaps even what
important information was presented at the meeting.

By the time I finished my work, the afternoon was nearing its
end. It was time for me to enjoy a leisurely moment. I picked
up a bottle of water and biscuits, while whistling. I had my
meal as I watched the sun’s descent in a cloudless sky. The
wind blew with a faint, warm breeze and the sea moved about
kindly. At that moment, I perceived an orange mass. I jerked
my head back. But the orange thing wasn’t moving and didn’t
look right. I looked again. It was a tiger. A shiver went through
my body.

suggests that personalization is generally good for both
employees and employers. People who decorate their offices
tend to have ① lower levels of job satisfaction. So companies
that allow their employees to personalize their workspaces

research showed that the degree of personalization in an office

Acronyms are words created from the first letters of each

34. Often, people report that a good cry can make them feel better
and more at peace. In one survey, 85% of women and 73% of
men reported feeling less sad or angry after crying. As a result of
this kind of information, a scientist conducted a research to
discover the chemical makeup of tears. He found that the tears
caused by sadness contained more total protein than those caused
by cutting a raw onion. He proposes that the emotionally based
tears contained high levels of cortisol, which is the primary
hormone released during stressful situations. This suggests that
we may be literally releasing toxins from our system when we
cry, and that crying itself may support our overall wellbeing.

35. Doing some amount of engaging work offers a comfortable
transition between full work mode and full retirement mode,
making early semi-retirement a good fit for middle-aged
people and their families. With a modest income from part-time
work, early semi-retirees may not have to face the dramatic
downshifting in spending and lifestyle. Early semi-retirees
learn that a bit of work, even unpaid work, keeps them
energized, contributing, and sharp. For those who are mentally
and financially ready, early semi-retirement can be the ideal
course for navigating a long, healthy, and happy life.
① the effects of early retirement on society
② the benefits of working as a semi-retiree
③ the raised awareness of old people’s welfare
④ the necessity of proper income for a happy life
⑤ the way of overcoming loneliness after retirement
36. chambered nautilus에 대한다음글의내용과일치하는것은?
The curious-looking chambered nautilus is considered to be a
living fossil. This animal reproduces by laying eggs. When a
young chambered nautilus first hatches from its egg, it is about
an inch in diameter and has a shell with seven chambers. The
average lifespan of the chambered nautilus is believed to be
about 20 years. It is thought to rely mainly on its sense of
smell when searching for food. Their eyesight is very poor
because their eyes contain no lenses. Instead, there is only a
tiny hole to allow light into the eye. Unfortunately, its
population is on the decline due to the harvesting of their
beautiful shells.

The SOFIA is a Boeing 747 jet developed jointly by NASA
and the German Aerospace Center. Instead of passenger seats,
the plane houses a powerful, 17-ton telescope in the rear
section of the aircraft. With four high-powered engines, SOFIA
can cruise at 520 miles per hour and reach an altitude of about
40,000 feet. Specialized modifications to the plane allow the
smooth ride needed for precise observations. There will be
about 8 hours of observing time on each flight. SOFIA is
expected to have a lifetime of 20 years and observe star-forming
regions and nearby galaxies.

39. It’s natural to believe that external events upset you. When
you’re mad at someone, you automatically make them the cause
of all your bad feelings. You say, “You’re annoying me!” When
you think like this, you’re actually fooling yourself because
other people really cannot make you angry. Some pushy
teenagers might crowd in front of you in line at the movie
theater. Your boyfriend might always show up late for dates in
spite of knowing how important promptness is to you. No matter
how unfair others might appear to you, they do not, never did,
and never will upset you. The bitter truth is that you’re the one
who’s creating every last ounce of the anger you experience.
①분노는남이아닌우리자신에게서비롯된다.

40. Say you’re thinking of writing a complaint letter. Your first
impulse may be to start it by spinning out your sad story, event
by event. But what’s your real goal here? If you’re like most
people, you want the wrong made right. Perhaps you even want
an apology. That’s where your letter should start: asking for
what you want. After all, this is what you most need to
communicate, and this is what the reader of your letter first
wants to know! If you were in his or her place, would you
really want to blindly start reading a list of sad events? You’d
want to first know why this person was writing to you; then
perhaps you’d be ready for the details.

41. None of your ideas will change the world if you keep them
inside of your head. At some point you will have to persuade
someone else to invest, buy, participate, or join. You would be
surprised at how many people fail to understand the importance
of this step. I often wonder how many truly revolutionary ideas
are never given a chance to succeed because the brilliant mind
that produced the idea could not tell the story behind it. Don’t let
poor communication damage the ultimate success of your ideas.
① Strive for Simplicity
②Attractive Products Matter
③ Innovative Sales Strategies
④ Change Your Ideas into Reality
⑤ Communication Leads to Brilliant Ideas
42. The carpark next to our library uses a pay-and-display
system. You feed coins into a meter and then get a ticket for
one to two hours to display on your dashboard. A couple of
months ago, a woman offered me her ticket as she was leaving;
the ticket still had one hour remaining. What a bonus: I didn’t
have to look for some spare coins. On the next visit, I noticed
that the parking fairy had left a ticket with about 45 minutes
remaining in the slot of the machine for some lucky person to
use. The parking fairy has inspired me to do the same
whenever I can. It’s a lovely feeling knowing that you could be
brightening up someone’s day with such a small gesture.
① Beware of Excessive Kindness
② Fairy Tales Give Us Inspiration
③ Unexpected Fortunes Cost a Lot
④ Prepare Your Coins, Save Your Time

More and more people are switching to a vegetarian diet,
and wonder if it’s good for their pets, too.
(A) Responding to this curiosity, some manufacturers claim that
their no-meat foods provide all the nutrients animals need,
but many doctors disagree. An expert says that it is hard to
create vegetarian diets that are safe for cats.
(B) In addition, dogs need vitamin D, which may be hard to
maintain without meat or dairy. “An unbalanced diet can
lead to nutritional deficiencies,” says vet Andrea Fascetti
of the University of California.
(C) In fact, cats are strictly meat-eating animals. They need
taurine, an amino acid found only in meat. Absence of
taurine can lead to cats’ blindness and even death.

At the same depth underwater, however, your veins would
collapse and your lungs would shrink to the size of a soda can.
Our living space on the Earth is very limited in that we have to
give up the vast underwater world as a land-based species. It’s
not simply that we can’t breathe in water, but that we couldn’t
bear the pressures. ( ① ) Because water is about 1,300 times
heavier than air, pressure rises swiftly as you descend. ( ② )
On land, if you rose to the top of a five-hundred-foot height, the
change in pressure would be slight. ( ③ ) Amazingly, people do
voluntarily dive to such depths, without breathing equipment, for
the fun of it in a sport known as free diving. ( ④ ) For them, the
experience of having their internal organs rudely deformed is
thought exciting. ( ⑤ ) To reach such depths, however, divers
must be dragged down by weights.

When our ancestors began farming and herding, they gave
up the advantages of mobility. It’s true that domesticating
sheep, cattle, or pigs does not bind you as tightly to one
place as planting grain does. But it certainly becomes more
costly to flee an enemy, who can steal your stores of food.
So the beginning of agriculture meant that our ancestors
would band together in larger groups than they had
previously been used to. Hunter-gatherer families could
easily split up once food got scarce or rivalries and tensions
grew too difficult to manage, but early farmers knew that
splitting up had become a far more dangerous thing to do. It
became more than ever essential to learn to live with others
and to manage conflict rather than to escape it.
At the beginning of the (A) for agriculture, our
ancestors needed to be (B) to protect their food
from enemies.

[46 ~ 47]다음글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
The human brain is not particularly sensitive to the
absolute magnitude of stimulation, but it is extraordinarily
sensitive to the differences. For example, if you are
blindfolded and asked to hold a wooden block in your hand,
would you be able to tell if a pack of gum is placed on top of
the block? The right answer is “It depends,” and what it
depends on is the weight of the block. If the block weighed
only 30 grams, then you’d immediately notice the 500
percent increase in weight when a 150-gram pack of gum is
added. But if the block weighed 5 kilograms, then you’d
never notice the 0.03 percent increase in weight. There is no
answer to the question “Can people detect 150 grams?” because
brains do not detect grams but they detect . And
the same is true for just about every physical property of an
object. Our sensitivity to the relative is not limited to
physical properties such as weight, brightness, or volume. It
extends to subjective properties, such as value, goodness,
and worth as well.

(A)
Marilyn Tina was working as a manager overseeing the
operations of 320 stores. One day a friend told her FLY, one
of the biggest multinational corporations, was planning to
open its own stores and CEO Jennifer Lawrence was
interested in hiring her to oversee the project. Because
Marilyn thought that working for FLY would be a great
opportunity, (a) she did some research prior to her meeting.
(B)
Then (b) she flew back to California wondering if she had
done the right thing. She felt that she had probably lost any
chance of getting a job there, but she also felt good about
having told the truth. Two weeks later, Jennifer called and
told her (c) she had reconsidered what Marilyn had said and
agreed with her assessment of the situation. She offered
Marilyn the job as vice president of clothing and accessories.
(C)
Marilyn’s dilemma was that her desire to work for FLY was
in conflict with her professional judgment about the products.
(d) She was afraid that if she told Jennifer what she
discovered, she wouldn’t get the job. When she met with
Jennifer, she hesitated at first, but finally told Jennifer that
she thought the stores would fail because the products would
not reflect what FLY stood for.
(D)
As she did her research, (e) she found out that FLY’s
products had been far behind comsumer’s demand for FLY
brand. FLY had simply bought stock goods and just put its
own label on them. The company bought clothing from
different manufacturers without any consistent standards in
size, quality, or color. It didn’t reflect the brand of FLY.
