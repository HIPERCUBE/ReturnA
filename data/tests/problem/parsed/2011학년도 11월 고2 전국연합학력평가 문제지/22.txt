much exposure to the sun is unhealthy. ①However, 81 percent
of them still think they look good after having been out in the
sun. ②With this reason, people love to go to the beaches for
vacations and turn their faces to the sun. ③ If work or school
keeps them from getting into the sun for real, they pretend to
