You come home exhausted from a day’s work! Your feet
ache, your back hurts, and you feel fatigued. You attribute
these feelings to getting older, working too hard or being
too stressed out. However, you should remember you may
actually have a foot problem. If you continue to ignore it,
the pain will just get worse and you can no longer do the
things you love. Pain in the feet can cause real disabilities
and may cause other problems as well. If your feet tire
easily and often become painful, don’t hesitate to consult
with your physician, and start to take care of your feet. If
you get proper treatment before it’s too late, you can stop
the health problems associated with foot pain.
