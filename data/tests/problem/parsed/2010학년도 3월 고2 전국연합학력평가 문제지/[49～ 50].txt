Hedwig von Restorff, a German psychologist, said that the
last item on a list has a long­lasting effect. This suggests
you should also pay attention to your words and behavior
as you part with someone, not just when you meet the
person. Keep in mind that, to leave a good impression, your
“good­bye” must be bigger than your “hello.”
Imagine you are sitting in a waiting room before a job
interview. You hear the words you’ve been waiting for, “Mr.
Baker will see you now.” You clear your throat, push back
your hair, and say a nervous “Thank you” to the
receptionist. The moment you enter Mr. Baker’s room, he
smiles, stands up, and walks around his big desk toward
you with his hand out. He says, “Welcome. Please have a
seat.” Settling in behind his desk, he says, “I’ve been
looking forward to meeting you.” The interview goes on
very well. But as the interview ends, so does his smile.
Instead of standing to see you out, he’s looking through
papers. With a disinterested voice and no eye contact, he
says, “I’ll give you a call later. Good­bye.” On your way
home, you begin to reflect on the interview. Did Mr. Baker
consciously try to make you feel upset? Of course not.
Maybe he had a lot of work to do. Perhaps he had an
important call to make. The reason could be anything, but
one thing is sure. Mr. Baker .
