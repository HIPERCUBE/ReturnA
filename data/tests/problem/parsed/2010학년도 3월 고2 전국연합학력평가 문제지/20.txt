As you know, I have been satisfied with your medical
service for the past six years. You have been so kind to me
and all the medications you prescribed have always been
effective. However, are you aware that the condition of your
waiting room is very disappointing? The carpet is rarely
vacuumed, the plastic plants are thick with dust, and the
magazines and children’s playthings are disorganized. A clean
environment seems particularly important in a clinic and
although I know what an excellent physician you are, I can’t
help worrying about how clean everything else is. I hope
you find this letter helpful rather than unpleasant― it was
written with the best of intentions.
