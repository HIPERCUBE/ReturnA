Scientists say the reason women love to spend hours
browsing in shops while men prefer to be in and out of
the store in minutes is down to their hunter­gatherer
past. While women spent their days gathering food, men
were hunters who made specific plans about how to
catch and kill their prey. These differing roles in
prehistoric times have evolved into differing shopping
styles, the researchers believe. Women spend hours
trying to find the right outfit, present or object, because
they spent ages trying to find the best quality foods in
the past. Men, on the other hand, decide in advance
what they want to buy and then go looking for it. Once
it is found, they return home.
How men and women used to get (A) in
prehistoric times developed into the way they (B)
in modern times.
(A) (B)
① food …… eat
② food …… shop
③ shelter …… sleep
④ shelter …… greet
⑤ clothing …… talk

(A) Once upon a time, a fox was talking to a wolf about
the strength of man and how no animal could beat him.
Hearing the fox, the arrogant wolf announced that if he
could see a man just once, he would attack and beat the
man. “I can help you to do that,” said the fox. “Come to me
early tomorrow morning, and I will show you one.”
(B) The fox said to the wolf, “Look, there comes a man.
He is the one you must attack.” The wolf then dashed to
the man. When the hunter saw him, he aimed and fired a
shot. The wolf made an awful face, but did not let himself
be frightened, and attacked him again. The hunter shot him
again. The wolf swallowed his pain and charged at the
hunter again, who in turn drew out his sword, and gave him
a blow with it. The wolf ran howling back to the fox.
(C) “Well,” said the fox, “how was the fight?” “Oh,”
replied the wolf, “I never imagined the strength of man to
be what it is. First, he took a stick from his shoulder, and
blew into it, and then something tickled me terribly. Then
he breathed once more into the stick, and something hit me
in the leg. Then when I got next to him, he drew a naked
rib out of his body, and he beat me so hard with it that he
almost killed me.” “Now you see!” the fox said. “Earlier,
you talked about things you cannot do. If you are not
careful, you will set goals that you cannot accomplish! I
hope you have learned some .”
(D) When the wolf arrived the next day, the fox took
him out to the path which the hunter used every day. First,
an old man came by. “Is that a man?” asked the wolf. “No,”
answered the fox. “He once was.” Afterwards came a little
boy on his way to school. “Is that a man?” “No, he will yet
become one.” Finally, the hunter came by with his gun on
his back and a sword at his side.

Hedwig von Restorff, a German psychologist, said that the
last item on a list has a long­lasting effect. This suggests
you should also pay attention to your words and behavior
as you part with someone, not just when you meet the
person. Keep in mind that, to leave a good impression, your
“good­bye” must be bigger than your “hello.”
Imagine you are sitting in a waiting room before a job
interview. You hear the words you’ve been waiting for, “Mr.
Baker will see you now.” You clear your throat, push back
your hair, and say a nervous “Thank you” to the
receptionist. The moment you enter Mr. Baker’s room, he
smiles, stands up, and walks around his big desk toward
you with his hand out. He says, “Welcome. Please have a
seat.” Settling in behind his desk, he says, “I’ve been
looking forward to meeting you.” The interview goes on
very well. But as the interview ends, so does his smile.
Instead of standing to see you out, he’s looking through
papers. With a disinterested voice and no eye contact, he
says, “I’ll give you a call later. Good­bye.” On your way
home, you begin to reflect on the interview. Did Mr. Baker
consciously try to make you feel upset? Of course not.
Maybe he had a lot of work to do. Perhaps he had an
important call to make. The reason could be anything, but
one thing is sure. Mr. Baker .
