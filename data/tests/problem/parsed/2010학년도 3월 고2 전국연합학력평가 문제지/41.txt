41. Sometimes, we get the most from giving without receiving.
In Mali, villagers have kept this idea for centuries, called
dama. It encourages Malians to maintain social connections
with family, friends, and complete strangers. They provide
goods and services with no expectation of a return gift.
Instead, the villagers understand that a gift will be “paid
forward,” and that the individual sacrifice will make the
community as a whole stronger and better connected. In a
nation where the government provides minimal services,
Mali’s dama protects the poor and the sick, helping those
ignored by a traditional economy.
