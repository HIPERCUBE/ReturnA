(A) Once upon a time, a fox was talking to a wolf about
the strength of man and how no animal could beat him.
Hearing the fox, the arrogant wolf announced that if he
could see a man just once, he would attack and beat the
man. “I can help you to do that,” said the fox. “Come to me
early tomorrow morning, and I will show you one.”
(B) The fox said to the wolf, “Look, there comes a man.
He is the one you must attack.” The wolf then dashed to
the man. When the hunter saw him, he aimed and fired a
shot. The wolf made an awful face, but did not let himself
be frightened, and attacked him again. The hunter shot him
again. The wolf swallowed his pain and charged at the
hunter again, who in turn drew out his sword, and gave him
a blow with it. The wolf ran howling back to the fox.
(C) “Well,” said the fox, “how was the fight?” “Oh,”
replied the wolf, “I never imagined the strength of man to
be what it is. First, he took a stick from his shoulder, and
blew into it, and then something tickled me terribly. Then
he breathed once more into the stick, and something hit me
in the leg. Then when I got next to him, he drew a naked
rib out of his body, and he beat me so hard with it that he
almost killed me.” “Now you see!” the fox said. “Earlier,
you talked about things you cannot do. If you are not
careful, you will set goals that you cannot accomplish! I
hope you have learned some .”
(D) When the wolf arrived the next day, the fox took
him out to the path which the hunter used every day. First,
an old man came by. “Is that a man?” asked the wolf. “No,”
answered the fox. “He once was.” Afterwards came a little
boy on his way to school. “Is that a man?” “No, he will yet
become one.” Finally, the hunter came by with his gun on
his back and a sword at his side.
