42. People today are great at multitasking. I catch up with my
grandmother on my cell phone while picking up my dry
cleaning, or send a text message to my client while standing
in line at the grocery store. I even saw a man in a business
suit digging chopsticks into a cup of noodles while hurrying
through the crowd on a busy street. Whether engaged in
daily life or at work, we are constantly faced with all kinds
of demands, so we respond most often, by trying to do
many things at once. We have become so accustomed to this
lifestyle that we have come to believe in the myth that we
can and must multitask.
