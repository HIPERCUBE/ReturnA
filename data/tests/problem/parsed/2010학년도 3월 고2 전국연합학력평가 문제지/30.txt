There are many types of outdoor wear for Islamic women.
The hijab is a scarf that covers the head and neck but
leaves the face ① clear. The shayla is a long scarf wrapped
around the head and pinned in place at the ② shoulder. The
khimar is a cape­like veil that hangs down to just above the
③waist. The chador is a full­body cloak, often accompanied
by a smaller headscarf ④ underneath. The burqa is the most
⑤ revealing of all Islamic veils. It is unique in that it has a
mesh screen to see through.
