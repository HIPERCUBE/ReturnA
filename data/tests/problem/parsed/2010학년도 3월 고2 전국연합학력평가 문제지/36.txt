The birch is a tree that grows in the coldest countries and
thrives in the Highlands of Scotland as well as in Sweden
and Russia. As it gets nearer to the Arctic region, it
becomes less tall. From an economic point of view, the birch
is one of the most useful trees. The bark is of unusual
whiteness and it is not affected by weather. These two
points have made the tree particularly suitable for furniture,
though its wood is not very durable. In ancient times, some
writings were recorded on the bark of this tree. The oil
from the tree is applied externally to treat skin complaints.
The sap from the tree makes a delicious wine when mixed
with lemon peel, honey, and spices.
