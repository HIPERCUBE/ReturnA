37. Irving Berlin에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Irving Berlin wrote the words and music for some of the
most popular songs of the twentieth century, and he was
helpful in the development of the popular song. He was born
in 1888 in the Russian village of Temun, but grew up in
New York. That’s because his whole family fled Russia to
look for religious freedom. He died in 1989 and wrote more
than one thousand songs during his long life. Many of his
songs have become timeless additions to America’s popular
culture. He composed “White Christmas” in 1939. It was
sung in the movie “Holiday Inn” in 1942 and became one of
the best‑selling songs of all time.
