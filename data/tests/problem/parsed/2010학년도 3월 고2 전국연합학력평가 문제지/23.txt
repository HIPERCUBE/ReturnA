Using heroes in the classroom is becoming more and more
popular, but careful thought should be given to lesson
planning. ①The instructor who wants to ensure the
effectiveness of the method needs to first find a suitable
hero. ② For instance, it may be more appropriate to use
Michael Jordan as a role model when teaching sports rather
than using Beethoven. ③ It is also important that the
instructor does not take away the human elements in heroes
and helps students understand they are ordinary people like
us. ④ People who become heroes have great talents or
exceptional skills, so we can’t easily follow them. ⑤That’s
because ordinary people who accomplish something
extraordinary can inspire students more than special people
can.
