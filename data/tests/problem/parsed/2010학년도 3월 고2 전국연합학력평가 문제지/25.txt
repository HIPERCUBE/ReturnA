25. There is one magical price that we don’t evaluate in the
same way as other prices. That price is “free.” Sometimes it
leads you to . Imagine you are
shopping for a gift certificate. Consider which of these two
offers you would choose: a $10 gift certificate for free and
a $20 gift certificate costing $7. If your first instinct is the
same as everyone else’s, you’ll take the first option, the
free option. Economically, though, this doesn’t make any
sense. When you look at it again, you can see that the $20
gift certificate is actually a better value: you get a $13 gift
certificate for free, but this is hidden by the word “free.” It
prevents you from thinking clearly.
