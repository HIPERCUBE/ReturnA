25. There is one magical price that we don’t evaluate in the
same way as other prices. That price is “free.” Sometimes it
leads you to . Imagine you are
shopping for a gift certificate. Consider which of these two
offers you would choose: a $10 gift certificate for free and
a $20 gift certificate costing $7. If your first instinct is the
same as everyone else’s, you’ll take the first option, the
free option. Economically, though, this doesn’t make any
sense. When you look at it again, you can see that the $20
gift certificate is actually a better value: you get a $13 gift
certificate for free, but this is hidden by the word “free.” It
prevents you from thinking clearly.

It was a little white­painted cottage with a neat garden.
There was no one at home and Sam waited on the front
steps. The first real sunshine of the new summer was
warming the hills and sea. From where he sat he could see
the ocean gleaming under the sunlight and a few seagulls
flying freely in the air. The islands near at hand were
covered with grass. Farther off they went blue into the
distance, bush­covered and misty. One or two small fishing
boats were going up towards the port, leaning to the light
wind. The wind came from behind him, wrinkling the
blue­green water below.

33. Airline reservation agents are nearly helpless when their
reservation system breaks down. Customers can go to
another airline that can immediately reserve a seat on a
competitive flight. In case the reservation system breaks
down, various techniques are used to reduce recovery time
to the shortest possible interval. One technique includes
frequently saving database copies to reduce the processing
time necessary to restore the database. When it is
economically possible, the entire system is duplicated on a
standby computer, complete with separate copies of the
database. It will take over system processing if anything
goes wrong on the primary computer.

34. Dogs yawn before attacking, Olympic athletes yawn before
performing, and fish yawn before they change activities.
Evidence even exists that yawning helps individuals perform
their tasks with greater accuracy and ease. Indeed, yawning
may be one of the most important mechanisms for regulating
the survival­related behavior in mammals. So if you want to
stay alert and active, it is essential that you yawn. In other
words, yawn as many times a day as possible: when you
wake up, when you’re confronting a difficult problem at
work, when you get ready to go to sleep, and when you feel
anger, anxiety or stress. [1점]

The graph above shows the percentage of breastfeeding
mothers from 1975 to 2005. ①As you can see, the greatest
increase in the percentage of breastfeeding mothers was from
1975 to 1980. ②But after 1980, the percentage of
breastfeeding mothers began to decrease and fell to 18 percent
in 1990. ③The percentage of breastfeeding mothers rose a bit
in 1995, but it was not as high as that in 1980. ④Notably, the

36. 다음 글에서 birch에 관한 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The birch is a tree that grows in the coldest countries and
thrives in the Highlands of Scotland as well as in Sweden
and Russia. As it gets nearer to the Arctic region, it
becomes less tall. From an economic point of view, the birch
is one of the most useful trees. The bark is of unusual
whiteness and it is not affected by weather. These two
points have made the tree particularly suitable for furniture,
though its wood is not very durable. In ancient times, some
writings were recorded on the bark of this tree. The oil
from the tree is applied externally to treat skin complaints.
The sap from the tree makes a delicious wine when mixed
with lemon peel, honey, and spices.

Irving Berlin wrote the words and music for some of the
most popular songs of the twentieth century, and he was
helpful in the development of the popular song. He was born
in 1888 in the Russian village of Temun, but grew up in
New York. That’s because his whole family fled Russia to
look for religious freedom. He died in 1989 and wrote more
than one thousand songs during his long life. Many of his
songs have become timeless additions to America’s popular
culture. He composed “White Christmas” in 1939. It was
sung in the movie “Holiday Inn” in 1942 and became one of
the best‑selling songs of all time.

Many of us complain about commercials on TV, but a
surprising new study shows that, contrary to popular belief,
commercials improve television viewing in many cases.
Researchers conducted two tests where participants watched
and evaluated either continuous or disrupted versions of
programs. In the first test, participants watched an episode
of a sitcom. Although the participants disliked commercials,
those who watched the sitcom with commercials liked it
better than those who watched it without them. The second
test found that people enjoyed a short animated clip more
when it was interrupted by a commercial than when it was
played continuously. * disrupted: 중단되는

You come home exhausted from a day’s work! Your feet
ache, your back hurts, and you feel fatigued. You attribute
these feelings to getting older, working too hard or being
too stressed out. However, you should remember you may
actually have a foot problem. If you continue to ignore it,
the pain will just get worse and you can no longer do the
things you love. Pain in the feet can cause real disabilities
and may cause other problems as well. If your feet tire
easily and often become painful, don’t hesitate to consult
with your physician, and start to take care of your feet. If
you get proper treatment before it’s too late, you can stop
the health problems associated with foot pain.

However, telephones can sometimes waste a lot of your

The phone can be a timesaver. ( ① ) Instead of emailing
someone, engaging in a phone call can allow you to get the

that steal your precious time. ( ④ ) For example, you may
receive a call from an opinion research center or a nagging

41. Sometimes, we get the most from giving without receiving.
In Mali, villagers have kept this idea for centuries, called
dama. It encourages Malians to maintain social connections
with family, friends, and complete strangers. They provide
goods and services with no expectation of a return gift.
Instead, the villagers understand that a gift will be “paid
forward,” and that the individual sacrifice will make the
community as a whole stronger and better connected. In a
nation where the government provides minimal services,
Mali’s dama protects the poor and the sick, helping those
ignored by a traditional economy.

42. People today are great at multitasking. I catch up with my
grandmother on my cell phone while picking up my dry
cleaning, or send a text message to my client while standing
in line at the grocery store. I even saw a man in a business
suit digging chopsticks into a cup of noodles while hurrying
through the crowd on a busy street. Whether engaged in
daily life or at work, we are constantly faced with all kinds
of demands, so we respond most often, by trying to do
many things at once. We have become so accustomed to this
lifestyle that we have come to believe in the myth that we
can and must multitask.

Even men and women who say they never cry can
usually remember crying as children. Most of us
probably think it is normal for men or women to cry at
certain times.
(A) For example, what would you think of an adult who
cried over losing a card game? Most people would think
it is against the social rules about when, where, and
why it is okay to cry.
(B) Who wouldn’t cry in such a sad situation? However, we
don’t always take this view of tears. Sometimes adults
who cry― or even children who do― lose the respect
of others.
(C) At such times we may even encourage them to cry. For
example, we just let people cry when a family member
dies.

Picasso and Braque began developing their new artistic
ideas in the early 1900s. Most of the paintings they saw
around them were realistic and appealing to the senses.
(A) , these two artists were more interested in
appealing to the viewer’s mind. They put less emphasis on
painting things exactly the way they looked. Instead, they
took three­dimensional objects and tried to make them look
flat. A painting of a woman, (B) , might show her
front, back, and sides all at the same time. You might see a
face in such a painting, and a vague body shape, but you
would probably also see a lot of geometric shapes that
represented the other parts of the body. The finished
paintings were more abstract than realistic.

Scientists say the reason women love to spend hours
browsing in shops while men prefer to be in and out of
the store in minutes is down to their hunter­gatherer
past. While women spent their days gathering food, men
were hunters who made specific plans about how to
catch and kill their prey. These differing roles in
prehistoric times have evolved into differing shopping
styles, the researchers believe. Women spend hours
trying to find the right outfit, present or object, because
they spent ages trying to find the best quality foods in
the past. Men, on the other hand, decide in advance
what they want to buy and then go looking for it. Once
it is found, they return home.
