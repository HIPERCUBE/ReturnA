27. Teenagers who are more likely
to have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep at night.
Dr. Gaby Badre of Sahlgren’s Academy in Sweden studied 21
healthy teens, aged 14 to 19, with regular working or
studying hours and no sleep problems. Ten of them were
light cell phone users, making or sending fewer than five
calls or text messages a day. The 11 heavy users made or
sent more than 15 calls or text messages a day. Four of
them sent more than 30 text messages a day, and one sent
more than 200. Results showed that compared with light
users, teens who were heavy users woke up more often
during the night, and spent more time tossing and turning
before falling asleep.
