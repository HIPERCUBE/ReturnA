The public’s fear of this is a major concern for policy
makers. They have constantly tried to drop the rate of this.
They have constructed new prisons and put more people into
them. However, it created more problems than it solved, as
prisons are responsible for breeding more of this. We need
more systematic efforts to prevent this. For those who put
money ahead of everything else, we need to teach moral
values. For those who are socially deprived, we should
provide more opportunities for education, housing, and
healthcare. Then we can all live in a world without this.
① crime ② strike ③ poverty
④ pollution ⑤ unemployment

John was driving home late one night when he picked up a

his passenger. So John checked to see if his wallet was safe
in his coat that was on the seat between them, but it wasn’t
there! Immediately, ② he stepped on the brakes, ordered the
hitchhiker out, and said, “Hand over the wallet right now!”
Frightened, ③ he handed over a wallet and got out of the
car. When he arrived home, ④ he started to tell his wife
about the experience. She interrupted ⑤ him, saying “Before I
forget, John, do you know that you left your wallet at home
this morning?”

As you know, I have been satisfied with your medical
service for the past six years. You have been so kind to me
and all the medications you prescribed have always been
effective. However, are you aware that the condition of your
waiting room is very disappointing? The carpet is rarely
vacuumed, the plastic plants are thick with dust, and the
magazines and children’s playthings are disorganized. A clean
environment seems particularly important in a clinic and
although I know what an excellent physician you are, I can’t
help worrying about how clean everything else is. I hope
you find this letter helpful rather than unpleasant― it was
written with the best of intentions.

“Oh, my! What can a “gym” teacher do without a gym?” Stop

you were trained to teach physical education. “Gym” teacher is
an old­fashioned term that some people still (B) use / use it to
describe a physical educator, and some people still use the word
“gym” to describe physical education. If you were trained to be
a physical education teacher, not having a gym (C) is / being not

Coffee is an important part of the Italian cuisine. Many of
the different kinds of coffee drinks that we have around the
world ①have originated from Italy. We commonly see people
②having coffee with milk. But it was the Italians ③ that first
started the trend with the cappuccino which has coffee, milk,
and an addition of milk foam on top. In the West and generally
around the world, you can go for a cup of coffee ④whenever
you want. This attitude, however, will not ⑤ accept in Italy,
where coffee is only a breakfast drink.

Using heroes in the classroom is becoming more and more
popular, but careful thought should be given to lesson
planning. ①The instructor who wants to ensure the
effectiveness of the method needs to first find a suitable
hero. ② For instance, it may be more appropriate to use
Michael Jordan as a role model when teaching sports rather
than using Beethoven. ③ It is also important that the
instructor does not take away the human elements in heroes
and helps students understand they are ordinary people like
us. ④ People who become heroes have great talents or
exceptional skills, so we can’t easily follow them. ⑤That’s
because ordinary people who accomplish something
extraordinary can inspire students more than special people
can.

24. I am incapable of taking anybody’s word as it is— I have
to see for myself. If I read a quoted source in a book, I
have to read the source from which the quote is taken. If
that source quotes someone else, I am motivated to find the
original. If I ever finally get to the originator of an idea, I
am driven to study the life and methods of that person. If
possible, I try to discover the observations which led the
person to a particular conclusion. This is time­consuming and
tiring, no question about it; but it is the only way that
satisfies me. In short, I am .

25. There is one magical price that we don’t evaluate in the
same way as other prices. That price is “free.” Sometimes it
leads you to . Imagine you are
shopping for a gift certificate. Consider which of these two
offers you would choose: a $10 gift certificate for free and
a $20 gift certificate costing $7. If your first instinct is the
same as everyone else’s, you’ll take the first option, the
free option. Economically, though, this doesn’t make any
sense. When you look at it again, you can see that the $20
gift certificate is actually a better value: you get a $13 gift
certificate for free, but this is hidden by the word “free.” It
prevents you from thinking clearly.
① poor decisions ② wise shopping
③ quick calculation ④ full satisfaction
⑤ unnecessary purchases

It’s well known that washing your hands with good

disease. What do you do when that’s just not an option? There

It was a little white­painted cottage with a neat garden.
There was no one at home and Sam waited on the front
steps. The first real sunshine of the new summer was
warming the hills and sea. From where he sat he could see
the ocean gleaming under the sunlight and a few seagulls
flying freely in the air. The islands near at hand were
covered with grass. Farther off they went blue into the
distance, bush­covered and misty. One or two small fishing
boats were going up towards the port, leaning to the light
wind. The wind came from behind him, wrinkling the
blue­green water below.

33. Airline reservation agents are nearly helpless when their
reservation system breaks down. Customers can go to
another airline that can immediately reserve a seat on a
competitive flight. In case the reservation system breaks
down, various techniques are used to reduce recovery time
to the shortest possible interval. One technique includes
frequently saving database copies to reduce the processing
time necessary to restore the database. When it is
economically possible, the entire system is duplicated on a
standby computer, complete with separate copies of the
database. It will take over system processing if anything
goes wrong on the primary computer.

34. Dogs yawn before attacking, Olympic athletes yawn before
performing, and fish yawn before they change activities.
Evidence even exists that yawning helps individuals perform
their tasks with greater accuracy and ease. Indeed, yawning
may be one of the most important mechanisms for regulating
the survival­related behavior in mammals. So if you want to
stay alert and active, it is essential that you yawn. In other
words, yawn as many times a day as possible: when you
wake up, when you’re confronting a difficult problem at
work, when you get ready to go to sleep, and when you feel
anger, anxiety or stress. [1점]
① positive effects of yawning
② ways of preventing yawning
③ mammals’ behavior for survival
④ using yawning as a warning signal
⑤ relationship between yawning and sleeping

The graph above shows the percentage of breastfeeding
mothers from 1975 to 2005. ①As you can see, the greatest
increase in the percentage of breastfeeding mothers was from
1975 to 1980. ②But after 1980, the percentage of
breastfeeding mothers began to decrease and fell to 18 percent
in 1990. ③The percentage of breastfeeding mothers rose a bit
in 1995, but it was not as high as that in 1980. ④Notably, the
percentage rose sharply to 31 percent in 2000, which was
three times higher than that in 1975. ⑤The percentage gap
between 2000 and 2005 was just one­fifth of that between
1995 and 2000.
36. 다음 글에서 birch에 관한 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The birch is a tree that grows in the coldest countries and
thrives in the Highlands of Scotland as well as in Sweden
and Russia. As it gets nearer to the Arctic region, it
becomes less tall. From an economic point of view, the birch
is one of the most useful trees. The bark is of unusual
whiteness and it is not affected by weather. These two
points have made the tree particularly suitable for furniture,
though its wood is not very durable. In ancient times, some
writings were recorded on the bark of this tree. The oil
from the tree is applied externally to treat skin complaints.
The sap from the tree makes a delicious wine when mixed
with lemon peel, honey, and spices.
* sap: 수액(樹液)
① 지역에 상관없이 동일한 높이까지 자란다.

37. Irving Berlin에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Irving Berlin wrote the words and music for some of the
most popular songs of the twentieth century, and he was
helpful in the development of the popular song. He was born
in 1888 in the Russian village of Temun, but grew up in
New York. That’s because his whole family fled Russia to
look for religious freedom. He died in 1989 and wrote more
than one thousand songs during his long life. Many of his
songs have become timeless additions to America’s popular
culture. He composed “White Christmas” in 1939. It was
sung in the movie “Holiday Inn” in 1942 and became one of
the best‑selling songs of all time.
① 대중 가요의 발전에 기여했다.
② 19세기 후반에 러시아에서 태어났다.

Many of us complain about commercials on TV, but a
surprising new study shows that, contrary to popular belief,
commercials improve television viewing in many cases.
Researchers conducted two tests where participants watched
and evaluated either continuous or disrupted versions of
programs. In the first test, participants watched an episode
of a sitcom. Although the participants disliked commercials,
those who watched the sitcom with commercials liked it
better than those who watched it without them. The second
test found that people enjoyed a short animated clip more
when it was interrupted by a commercial than when it was
played continuously. * disrupted: 중단되는

You come home exhausted from a day’s work! Your feet
ache, your back hurts, and you feel fatigued. You attribute
these feelings to getting older, working too hard or being
too stressed out. However, you should remember you may
actually have a foot problem. If you continue to ignore it,
the pain will just get worse and you can no longer do the
things you love. Pain in the feet can cause real disabilities
and may cause other problems as well. If your feet tire
easily and often become painful, don’t hesitate to consult
with your physician, and start to take care of your feet. If
you get proper treatment before it’s too late, you can stop
the health problems associated with foot pain.

However, telephones can sometimes waste a lot of your
time.
The phone can be a timesaver. ( ① ) Instead of emailing
someone, engaging in a phone call can allow you to get the
answers right away. ( ② ) Speaking is definitely faster
than writing. ( ③ ) Often you get unwanted phone calls
that steal your precious time. ( ④ ) For example, you may
receive a call from an opinion research center or a nagging
salesperson. ( ⑤ ) Also, telephones require the use of your
hand, which makes it difficult to do other tasks while you

41. Sometimes, we get the most from giving without receiving.
In Mali, villagers have kept this idea for centuries, called
dama. It encourages Malians to maintain social connections
with family, friends, and complete strangers. They provide
goods and services with no expectation of a return gift.
Instead, the villagers understand that a gift will be “paid
forward,” and that the individual sacrifice will make the
community as a whole stronger and better connected. In a
nation where the government provides minimal services,
Mali’s dama protects the poor and the sick, helping those
ignored by a traditional economy.

42. People today are great at multitasking. I catch up with my
grandmother on my cell phone while picking up my dry
cleaning, or send a text message to my client while standing
in line at the grocery store. I even saw a man in a business
suit digging chopsticks into a cup of noodles while hurrying
through the crowd on a busy street. Whether engaged in
daily life or at work, we are constantly faced with all kinds
of demands, so we respond most often, by trying to do
many things at once. We have become so accustomed to this
lifestyle that we have come to believe in the myth that we
can and must multitask.

Even men and women who say they never cry can
usually remember crying as children. Most of us
probably think it is normal for men or women to cry at
certain times.
(A) For example, what would you think of an adult who
cried over losing a card game? Most people would think
it is against the social rules about when, where, and
why it is okay to cry.
(B) Who wouldn’t cry in such a sad situation? However, we
don’t always take this view of tears. Sometimes adults
who cry― or even children who do― lose the respect
of others.
(C) At such times we may even encourage them to cry. For
example, we just let people cry when a family member
dies.

Picasso and Braque began developing their new artistic
ideas in the early 1900s. Most of the paintings they saw
around them were realistic and appealing to the senses.
(A) , these two artists were more interested in
appealing to the viewer’s mind. They put less emphasis on
painting things exactly the way they looked. Instead, they
took three­dimensional objects and tried to make them look
flat. A painting of a woman, (B) , might show her
front, back, and sides all at the same time. You might see a
face in such a painting, and a vague body shape, but you
would probably also see a lot of geometric shapes that
represented the other parts of the body. The finished
paintings were more abstract than realistic.

Scientists say the reason women love to spend hours
browsing in shops while men prefer to be in and out of
the store in minutes is down to their hunter­gatherer
past. While women spent their days gathering food, men
were hunters who made specific plans about how to
catch and kill their prey. These differing roles in
prehistoric times have evolved into differing shopping
styles, the researchers believe. Women spend hours
trying to find the right outfit, present or object, because
they spent ages trying to find the best quality foods in
the past. Men, on the other hand, decide in advance
what they want to buy and then go looking for it. Once
it is found, they return home.
How men and women used to get (A) in
prehistoric times developed into the way they (B)

(A) Once upon a time, a fox was talking to a wolf about
the strength of man and how no animal could beat him.
Hearing the fox, the arrogant wolf announced that if he
could see a man just once, he would attack and beat the
man. “I can help you to do that,” said the fox. “Come to me
early tomorrow morning, and I will show you one.”
(B) The fox said to the wolf, “Look, there comes a man.
He is the one you must attack.” The wolf then dashed to
the man. When the hunter saw him, he aimed and fired a
shot. The wolf made an awful face, but did not let himself
be frightened, and attacked him again. The hunter shot him
again. The wolf swallowed his pain and charged at the
hunter again, who in turn drew out his sword, and gave him
a blow with it. The wolf ran howling back to the fox.
(C) “Well,” said the fox, “how was the fight?” “Oh,”
replied the wolf, “I never imagined the strength of man to
be what it is. First, he took a stick from his shoulder, and
blew into it, and then something tickled me terribly. Then
he breathed once more into the stick, and something hit me
in the leg. Then when I got next to him, he drew a naked
rib out of his body, and he beat me so hard with it that he
almost killed me.” “Now you see!” the fox said. “Earlier,
you talked about things you cannot do. If you are not
careful, you will set goals that you cannot accomplish! I
hope you have learned some .”
(D) When the wolf arrived the next day, the fox took
him out to the path which the hunter used every day. First,
an old man came by. “Is that a man?” asked the wolf. “No,”
answered the fox. “He once was.” Afterwards came a little
boy on his way to school. “Is that a man?” “No, he will yet
become one.” Finally, the hunter came by with his gun on
his back and a sword at his side.

Hedwig von Restorff, a German psychologist, said that the
last item on a list has a long­lasting effect. This suggests
you should also pay attention to your words and behavior
as you part with someone, not just when you meet the
person. Keep in mind that, to leave a good impression, your
“good­bye” must be bigger than your “hello.”
Imagine you are sitting in a waiting room before a job
interview. You hear the words you’ve been waiting for, “Mr.
Baker will see you now.” You clear your throat, push back
your hair, and say a nervous “Thank you” to the
receptionist. The moment you enter Mr. Baker’s room, he
smiles, stands up, and walks around his big desk toward
you with his hand out. He says, “Welcome. Please have a
seat.” Settling in behind his desk, he says, “I’ve been
looking forward to meeting you.” The interview goes on
very well. But as the interview ends, so does his smile.
Instead of standing to see you out, he’s looking through
papers. With a disinterested voice and no eye contact, he
says, “I’ll give you a call later. Good­bye.” On your way
home, you begin to reflect on the interview. Did Mr. Baker
consciously try to make you feel upset? Of course not.
Maybe he had a lot of work to do. Perhaps he had an
important call to make. The reason could be anything, but
one thing is sure. Mr. Baker .
