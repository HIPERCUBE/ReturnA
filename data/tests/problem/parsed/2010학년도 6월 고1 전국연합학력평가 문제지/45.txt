From time to time, the tribe gathered in a circle. They
just talked and talked and talked, apparently with no
purpose. They made no decisions. There was no leader.
And everybody could participate. There may have been wise
men or wise women that were listened to a bit more― the
older ones― but everybody could talk. The meeting went
on, until it finally seemed to stop for no reason at all and
the group broke up. Yet after that, everybody seemed to

downtown San Francisco in a neighborhood with many
homeless people hanging around. When directors were
just sitting down to a luxurious meal, there was a loud
knocking on the door. The knocking was increasingly
loud and the board members suggested to their host that
it might be wise to ignore it and not open the door.
(B)
When the homeless men finished the food, they turned
to the alarmed board members and asked, “Where did all

Would you really miss it if you shared some of it with
us? What does your company do? Don’t your ads say
that you care about people like us?”
(C)
But the host said no and opened the door. There were
a few homeless men. They said that they were hungry
and needed food. To the horror of the board members,
the host invited them in, and said, “Sure, we’ve got a lot
of good food. Come on in. Sit down.” So the homeless
men sat down at the table and started to eat the caviar,
the salmon, the lobster and everything else.
(D)
As the homeless men’s questions became more

When Edna was 12 years old, her mother was in the
hospital seriously ill. She made a get­well card for her
mother. The card says; “I wish you health. I wish you
wealth. I wish you happiness.” Mother was touched by her
daughter’s thoughtfulness. She said; “You are always so
thoughtful. You are such a good girl.” Suddenly, Edna grew
pale, ran into the bathroom and started crying. Mother
immediately thought there was some kind of relation

pretty and witty. It’s lovely. I feel better already.” Edna
would have been delighted.
