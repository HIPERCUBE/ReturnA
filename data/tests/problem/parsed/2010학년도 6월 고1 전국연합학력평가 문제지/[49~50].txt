When Edna was 12 years old, her mother was in the
hospital seriously ill. She made a get­well card for her
mother. The card says; “I wish you health. I wish you
wealth. I wish you happiness.” Mother was touched by her
daughter’s thoughtfulness. She said; “You are always so
thoughtful. You are such a good girl.” Suddenly, Edna grew
pale, ran into the bathroom and started crying. Mother
immediately thought there was some kind of relation
between the praise and the reaction. Why should such
praise make her daughter cry? When mother praised her
daughter, Edna felt . She knew she was
not always thoughtful. She knew she was sometimes
selfish, often angry and always imperfect.
What should mother have said when she received the
card? Something about the card, not about the child. For
example: “Thank you so much. I like the card. It’s so
pretty and witty. It’s lovely. I feel better already.” Edna
would have been delighted.
