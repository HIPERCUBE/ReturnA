39. Everyone is creative in different ways. Creativity that is
locked inside is sometimes only released if a suitable outlet
is found. Many people express their creativity through fine
arts. But creativity is not limited to the fine arts. Chefs
depart from recipe books to create new dishes. Knitters
soon abandon conventional patterns and design their own. To

an appropriate medium is not always easy, but it is far from
impossible. The best approach is to constantly explore until
your calling is found.
