37. Shishmaref 마을에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Shishmaref was a village in the furthest reaches of Alaska.
About 15 years ago, the people of the small, oceanfront
hunting village noticed something odd. The ice that
surrounded and protected the village began melting. As the
ice continued to melt away at an alarming pace during the
1990s, the village began to lose the protection and could be
easily damaged by storm waves. In 1997, the town
completely lost a 125­foot­wide strip of land at its northern
edge. In 2001, a storm with 12­foot­high waves destroyed
dozens of homes. And finally, in the summer of 2002, with
the situation getting worse, the residents were forced to
move their entire town miles inland.
