The above graph shows the number of responses to the
survey of reasons for students’ lack of sleep at North
Carolina State University. ①The graph clearly displays that
‘homework’ was the number one reason among college
students. ② Surprisingly, ‘going out with friends’ received
less than forty responses, which had been expected to be
higher as college students have parties often. ③The second
reason for lack of sleep was ‘trouble falling asleep.’ ④More
than 40 students said they couldn’t sleep enough because
they spent their time on computers. ⑤And computers
caused more students to have sleepless nights than TV did.
