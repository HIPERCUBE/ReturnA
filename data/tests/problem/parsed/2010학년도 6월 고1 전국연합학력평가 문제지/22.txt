Raised in a poor family, Confucius truly understood the
suffering of the people. In his view, the lords of his
country, only interested in their own personal gain, ①were
responsible for it. Therefore, he gathered a group of
intelligent followers ②what he trained in several subjects
including ethics. He believed that government leaders must
be humane, honest and ③ fair, not experts in administration.
He taught his students that it is the role of rulers ④ to
secure the happiness of their people. He had considerable
success in placing his pupils in positions of power in
government. When the men who ⑤ had been trained by him
were sent into service, even immoral rulers valued their
honesty.
