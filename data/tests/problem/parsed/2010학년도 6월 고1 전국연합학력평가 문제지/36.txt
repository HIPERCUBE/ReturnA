36. Star Wreck에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Finnish filmmaker Timo Vuorensola came up with the idea
for his movie Star Wreck, whose original was Star Trek. He
knew that looking for conventional distribution would be
almost impossible. An amateur, science­fiction comedy with
an extremely small budget would hardly be attractive to
mainstream studios. So Vuorensola took matters into his own
hands: he used a social networking site to build up an online
fan base, who contributed to the storyline and even offered
their acting skills. In return for the help, Vuorensola
released Star Wreck in 2005 online for free. Seven hundred
thousand copies were downloaded in the first week alone,
reaching 9 million today.
