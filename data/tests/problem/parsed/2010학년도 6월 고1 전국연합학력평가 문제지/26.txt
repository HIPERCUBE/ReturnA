predators with experience of skunks avoid them both
because of and their distinctive body shape.
She wanted to know how predators know a skunk is a
skunk. She prepared lots of stuffed black­and­white skunks
and gray foxes, which were about the same size. She dyed
the stuffed skunks gray and the foxes black­and­white. She

places where skunks were common, predators such as bears
and mountain lions wouldn’t attempt to drag away the
black­and­white foxes as well as the gray skunks.
