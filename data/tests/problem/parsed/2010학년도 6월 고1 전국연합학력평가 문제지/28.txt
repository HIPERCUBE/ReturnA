28. Imagine you are a spacecraft. There’s no air at all out
there in space. One side of you cooks in the sun, while your
other side freezes in the shade. Inside you are computers,
communications equipment, and all sorts of other delicate,
high­tech materials. Most of your parts work best if they
are neither too hot nor too cold. But, unfortunately, heaters
and coolers take up lots of room, use a lot of electricity,
and add a lot of weight to the spacecraft at liftoff. What’s
to be done? Engineers with NASA’s New Millennium
Program have come up with some new ways in
a spacecraft, without adding weight, using too much power,
or taking up too much room.
① to move place to place
② to control the temperature
③ to communicate effectively
④ to help train new astronauts
⑤ to learn more about instruments
