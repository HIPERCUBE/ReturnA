18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
This is a strong emotion that you can have for a person
or an object. This is the force that motivates us to express
ourselves in the world. Nothing great in the world has ever
been accomplished without this. Misguided, this becomes an
obsession, and there is a great difference between having
this for something and being obsessed with something. This
is positive and energizing. An obsession is negative and
destructive. People with this do what they are doing out of
love. The person with an obsession will work out of fear or
selfish desire.
* obsession: 집착
① passion ② anger
③ diligence ④ jealousy
⑤ intelligence
19. 밑줄 친 They[they]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Mockingbirds are brownish­gray, and about nine inches
long. ①They prefer to nest within human habitats. ②They
locate their nests in bushes surrounding buildings, very often
where grass lawns exist. ③They use dead branches and
stems for building materials and line their nests with grasses.
It’s easy to identify mockingbird nests because ④ they
generally appear to be roughly­built. “The birds don’t need
well­designed nests, as ⑤ they usually build them in
protected bushes,” said a biologist, Cris Tomlinson.
20. 다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?
“Twinkle, twinkle, little star,” how I wonder where you
are. Wonder no more. San Diego has always been an
excellent place to spot the stars, with its quiet hilltops and
plains. “Star light, star bright,” it all awaits at the Palomar
Observatory tonight. The Palomar Observatory, located on
Palomar Mountain, offers a view of sparkles in the sky with
five telescopes used nightly for a wide variety of
astronomical research. It is home of the famous Hale
telescope, a 200­inch telescope that is the workhorse for
modern astronomy.

Raised in a poor family, Confucius truly understood the
suffering of the people. In his view, the lords of his
country, only interested in their own personal gain, ①were
responsible for it. Therefore, he gathered a group of
intelligent followers ②what he trained in several subjects
including ethics. He believed that government leaders must
be humane, honest and ③ fair, not experts in administration.
He taught his students that it is the role of rulers ④ to
secure the happiness of their people. He had considerable
success in placing his pupils in positions of power in
government. When the men who ⑤ had been trained by him
were sent into service, even immoral rulers valued their
honesty.

final hour of flight, passengers must remain seated. ⑤They
won’t be allowed access to carry­on baggage or to have any
items in their laps.

24. Certain announcements like “You’re fired,” or “There’s
been an accident,” make you feel shocked. When you hear
them, remember this healthy way to cope: get some .
In one experiment, researchers asked people to think of a
difficult episode from their past. Those in one group were
told to relive the event as if it were happening again; the
others were instructed to recall the memory, stepping back
from the scene as if it were a video. Surprisingly, the latter
group felt less stressed and had lower blood pressure.
* relive: 되살리다
① distance ② sleep ③ food
④ exercise ⑤ criticism
25. Consciously and unconsciously, people tend to imitate
those around them. That’s why the latest research shows
that things like happiness, depression and obesity can spread
like wildfires through social networks. So, surround yourself
with friends who can also be . You can hang
out with people who look and act the way you would like
to. Social imitation is the easiest form of self­improvement.
Social support is critical to changing all kinds of behavior.
Good friends can not only help you through bad times, but
they can also help you stay focused on your goals.
① severe critics ② role models
③ running mates ④ social workers
⑤ great competitors
26. According to a wildlife researcher, Jennifer Hunter,
predators with experience of skunks avoid them both
because of and their distinctive body shape.
She wanted to know how predators know a skunk is a
skunk. She prepared lots of stuffed black­and­white skunks
and gray foxes, which were about the same size. She dyed
the stuffed skunks gray and the foxes black­and­white. She
then placed the animals at many sites around California. In
places where skunks were common, predators such as bears
and mountain lions wouldn’t attempt to drag away the
black­and­white foxes as well as the gray skunks.
* stuffed: 박제된
① their coloration ② their violence
③ their bad smell ④ the movement
⑤ the unique sound
27. When we search for something on the Internet, why do
we get 11,980,764 results? Tens of millions of pages exist
on the Internet, and many more are being added every day.
When you are in a hurry, such a huge amount of results
make you feel more irritated. To prevent a gigantic list of
results, you should . For example,
search not on classical music, but on Beethoven symphonies;
not cake recipes, but chocolate cake recipes. Also, spending
ten minutes or so to read the search engines’ search tips
will save you time, and reduce your frustration level.
① visit various websites
② change the search engine
③ be as specific as possible
④ use a brand­new computer
⑤ employ a computer expert
28. Imagine you are a spacecraft. There’s no air at all out
there in space. One side of you cooks in the sun, while your
other side freezes in the shade. Inside you are computers,
communications equipment, and all sorts of other delicate,
high­tech materials. Most of your parts work best if they
are neither too hot nor too cold. But, unfortunately, heaters
and coolers take up lots of room, use a lot of electricity,
and add a lot of weight to the spacecraft at liftoff. What’s
to be done? Engineers with NASA’s New Millennium
Program have come up with some new ways in
a spacecraft, without adding weight, using too much power,
or taking up too much room.
① to move place to place
② to control the temperature
③ to communicate effectively
④ to help train new astronauts
⑤ to learn more about instruments

name. Say ‘television’, ‘computer’ or ‘internet’ anywhere, and

But hand­held phones? Although this technology is all over
the world, different countries have (B) identical / different
names for them. Under millions of Christmas trees North
and South Americans have been unwrapping cell phones or

The sound was coming closer; he could hear the whisper
of leaves clearly off to his left. On the ground before him
was a stick. It was only a small branch, but he reached for
it anyway. He stripped the leaves from it and grasped it
tightly. Perhaps, he thought wildly, he could blind the beast
as it scratched him, trying to drag him from between the
rocks. How long would he have to wait? At last, without
further warning, the creature came into view. He felt his
pulse hammering in his throat. His thoughts seemed to be
running a desperate race with each other.
① funny ② urgent ③ festive
④ peaceful ⑤ monotonous

One of the best ways to help someone save face is to let
them come to the conclusion that they’re wrong all by
themselves. By asking a few simple questions, we can give
people the chance to explain themselves or admit they need
to go back to the drawing board. (A) , your best friend
wants to get her tongue pierced. You could say, “Yuck, not
only is it disgusting, but piercing is so old.” (B) , why
not ask a few leading questions, like, “Do you think it will
hurt? What happens if it gets infected? I hear that can be
pretty serious.” She may realize on her own she has some
more thinking to do.

33. Why are people in a certain area suffering from malaria
more often than others? Mountain people build their houses
raised above the ground. They also keep their animals below
the house and have their cooking fire inside the house.
Mosquitoes fly close to the ground, preferring to bite
animals instead of people and seldom enter the smoke­filled
house of the mountain people. On the other hand, lowland
people build their houses right on the ground, keeping their
domestic animals away from the house and cook outside.
Mosquitoes easily enter the ground­level houses and bite the
people in their houses because there are no animals to

34. I knew I ate the wrong foods: sweets for breakfast, soda
and chips for lunch and second helpings at dinner. I didn’t
really know what the right foods were. I just knew I needed
to eat less. So I ate the smallest portions I could. Not
surprisingly, I lost weight but I had so little energy. By
reading health magazines I learned food wasn’t my enemy. I
just had to make better choices: a banana, cereal, and
fat­free milk every morning; grilled chicken and a piece of
fruit for lunch; and a turkey sandwich on whole wheat for
dinner. My energy returned, and I continued to drop weight.

The above graph shows the number of responses to the
survey of reasons for students’ lack of sleep at North
Carolina State University. ①The graph clearly displays that
‘homework’ was the number one reason among college
students. ② Surprisingly, ‘going out with friends’ received
less than forty responses, which had been expected to be
higher as college students have parties often. ③The second
reason for lack of sleep was ‘trouble falling asleep.’ ④More
than 40 students said they couldn’t sleep enough because
they spent their time on computers. ⑤And computers
36. Star Wreck에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Finnish filmmaker Timo Vuorensola came up with the idea
for his movie Star Wreck, whose original was Star Trek. He
knew that looking for conventional distribution would be
almost impossible. An amateur, science­fiction comedy with
an extremely small budget would hardly be attractive to
mainstream studios. So Vuorensola took matters into his own
hands: he used a social networking site to build up an online
fan base, who contributed to the storyline and even offered
their acting skills. In return for the help, Vuorensola
released Star Wreck in 2005 online for free. Seven hundred
thousand copies were downloaded in the first week alone,
reaching 9 million today.
① 공상과학영화 Star Trek의 원작이다.
② 스튜디오 제작 경비가 많이 들었다.

37. Shishmaref 마을에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Shishmaref was a village in the furthest reaches of Alaska.
About 15 years ago, the people of the small, oceanfront
hunting village noticed something odd. The ice that
surrounded and protected the village began melting. As the
ice continued to melt away at an alarming pace during the
1990s, the village began to lose the protection and could be
easily damaged by storm waves. In 1997, the town
completely lost a 125­foot­wide strip of land at its northern
edge. In 2001, a storm with 12­foot­high waves destroyed
dozens of homes. And finally, in the summer of 2002, with
the situation getting worse, the residents were forced to
move their entire town miles inland.

38. No one wants to tell a story to have the listeners look
puzzled and say, “Huh?” The story needs to make sense in
relation to what came before and what is likely to follow. A
story in isolation is likely to be misunderstood. Perhaps the
real danger of an isolated story is that its original intention
can be reversed. For example, people often quote Robert
Frost’s Mending Wall to stress the needs for fences, saying
“Good fences make good neighbors.” However, when you
read the entire poem, you come to realize Frost is
questioning the need for fences.

39. Everyone is creative in different ways. Creativity that is
locked inside is sometimes only released if a suitable outlet
is found. Many people express their creativity through fine
arts. But creativity is not limited to the fine arts. Chefs
depart from recipe books to create new dishes. Knitters
soon abandon conventional patterns and design their own. To
realize their creative potential, individuals must be matched
to the medium through which they will work. The search for
an appropriate medium is not always easy, but it is far from
impossible. The best approach is to constantly explore until
your calling is found.
① Change your way of life right now.
② Design your own life without others’ help.
③ Match your interest to the social standard.
④ Find the right way to show your creativity.
⑤ Focus on one area without wandering around.

But the fire chief insisted and as they exited the

In October 2001, a fire crew was fighting a fire in a

crew into the building. ( ② ) They were starting to make
progress in putting the fire out, when the fire chief decided
something was wrong and ordered his team out of the

complete potential for a brilliant smile. They have the right
genes for perfect teeth. But others don’t. These are the
ones who may need help from a dentist. The treatment to
obtain a brilliant smile may take up to four years. That is to
say, one might need to wear braces for two years and then
a retainer for two years to keep their teeth in place. For
one to acquire that brilliant smile, many procedures are
involved, and the patient’s cooperation is essential.

42. Take a small pocket dictionary. Look at five pages at
random and count the number of words you know. Divide it
by 5 and calculate how many words you know on one page.
By multiplying the number by the total number of pages in
the whole dictionary, you can get an approximation about
how many words you know in a dictionary. To your
surprise, you know a small fraction of words in the
dictionary. You should also take into account that most
dictionaries contain only a small sample of all the words in
your language. It means that you probably know an even
smaller proportion of the total vocabulary of the language.

How will your kids spend this summer? Building sand
castles at the beach? Swimming at summer camp? While
studying about education, I was surprised to learn that
children drop in IQ each summer vacation— because they
aren’t in school or exercising their brains. This is less true
of some students whose parents make them read books. But
other kids fall two months behind in reading level each
summer break. That accounts for much of the difference in
learning course between the two. A mountain of research
points to an important lesson: keep your kids away from the
keyboard and the television this summer, and get them to
read.

From time to time, the tribe gathered in a circle. They
just talked and talked and talked, apparently with no
purpose. They made no decisions. There was no leader.
And everybody could participate. There may have been wise
men or wise women that were listened to a bit more― the
older ones― but everybody could talk. The meeting went
on, until it finally seemed to stop for no reason at all and
the group broke up. Yet after that, everybody seemed to
know what to do, because they understood each other so
well. They could get together in smaller groups and do
something or decide things for themselves.

(A)
There was a board meeting of 100 major companies in
downtown San Francisco in a neighborhood with many
homeless people hanging around. When directors were
just sitting down to a luxurious meal, there was a loud
knocking on the door. The knocking was increasingly
loud and the board members suggested to their host that
it might be wise to ignore it and not open the door.
(B)
When the homeless men finished the food, they turned
to the alarmed board members and asked, “Where did all
this food come from? Why don’t you share some of this
with people like us? We are hungry. We need food.
Would you really miss it if you shared some of it with
us? What does your company do? Don’t your ads say
that you care about people like us?”
(C)
But the host said no and opened the door. There were
a few homeless men. They said that they were hungry
and needed food. To the horror of the board members,
the host invited them in, and said, “Sure, we’ve got a lot
of good food. Come on in. Sit down.” So the homeless
men sat down at the table and started to eat the caviar,
the salmon, the lobster and everything else.
(D)
As the homeless men’s questions became more
aggressive, the board members’ answers became more
defensive. The board members became more and more
concerned. The host finally revealed that the homeless
men were hired actors for an opening to a main issue of
the meeting, the board’s .

[49~50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
When Edna was 12 years old, her mother was in the
hospital seriously ill. She made a get­well card for her
mother. The card says; “I wish you health. I wish you
wealth. I wish you happiness.” Mother was touched by her
daughter’s thoughtfulness. She said; “You are always so
thoughtful. You are such a good girl.” Suddenly, Edna grew
pale, ran into the bathroom and started crying. Mother
immediately thought there was some kind of relation
between the praise and the reaction. Why should such
praise make her daughter cry? When mother praised her
daughter, Edna felt . She knew she was
not always thoughtful. She knew she was sometimes
selfish, often angry and always imperfect.
What should mother have said when she received the
card? Something about the card, not about the child. For
example: “Thank you so much. I like the card. It’s so
pretty and witty. It’s lovely. I feel better already.” Edna
would have been delighted.
