34. I knew I ate the wrong foods: sweets for breakfast, soda
and chips for lunch and second helpings at dinner. I didn’t
really know what the right foods were. I just knew I needed
to eat less. So I ate the smallest portions I could. Not
surprisingly, I lost weight but I had so little energy. By
reading health magazines I learned food wasn’t my enemy. I
just had to make better choices: a banana, cereal, and
fat­free milk every morning; grilled chicken and a piece of
fruit for lunch; and a turkey sandwich on whole wheat for
dinner. My energy returned, and I continued to drop weight.
