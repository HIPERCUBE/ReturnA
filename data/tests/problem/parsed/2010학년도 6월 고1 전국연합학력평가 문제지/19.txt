Mockingbirds are brownish­gray, and about nine inches
long. ①They prefer to nest within human habitats. ②They
locate their nests in bushes surrounding buildings, very often
where grass lawns exist. ③They use dead branches and
stems for building materials and line their nests with grasses.
It’s easy to identify mockingbird nests because ④ they
generally appear to be roughly­built. “The birds don’t need
well­designed nests, as ⑤ they usually build them in
protected bushes,” said a biologist, Cris Tomlinson.
