How will your kids spend this summer? Building sand
castles at the beach? Swimming at summer camp? While
studying about education, I was surprised to learn that
children drop in IQ each summer vacation— because they
aren’t in school or exercising their brains. This is less true
of some students whose parents make them read books. But
other kids fall two months behind in reading level each
summer break. That accounts for much of the difference in
learning course between the two. A mountain of research
points to an important lesson: keep your kids away from the
keyboard and the television this summer, and get them to
read.
