18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은?
This is a strong emotion that you can have for a person
or an object. This is the force that motivates us to express
ourselves in the world. Nothing great in the world has ever
been accomplished without this. Misguided, this becomes an
obsession, and there is a great difference between having
this for something and being obsessed with something. This
is positive and energizing. An obsession is negative and
destructive. People with this do what they are doing out of
love. The person with an obsession will work out of fear or
selfish desire.
* obsession: 집착
① passion ② anger
③ diligence ④ jealousy
⑤ intelligence
