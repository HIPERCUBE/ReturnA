42. Take a small pocket dictionary. Look at five pages at
random and count the number of words you know. Divide it
by 5 and calculate how many words you know on one page.
By multiplying the number by the total number of pages in
the whole dictionary, you can get an approximation about
how many words you know in a dictionary. To your
surprise, you know a small fraction of words in the
dictionary. You should also take into account that most
dictionaries contain only a small sample of all the words in
your language. It means that you probably know an even
smaller proportion of the total vocabulary of the language.
