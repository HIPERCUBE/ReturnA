33. Why are people in a certain area suffering from malaria
more often than others? Mountain people build their houses
raised above the ground. They also keep their animals below
the house and have their cooking fire inside the house.
Mosquitoes fly close to the ground, preferring to bite
animals instead of people and seldom enter the smoke­filled
house of the mountain people. On the other hand, lowland
people build their houses right on the ground, keeping their
domestic animals away from the house and cook outside.
Mosquitoes easily enter the ground­level houses and bite the
people in their houses because there are no animals to
attract them away.
