language. ④Voice recognition systems were welcomed in the
computer industry. ⑤To overcome this challenge and produce

what is not said. To get the most out of what you read, you

of life, he will make life miserable and unsuccessful. [3점]

39. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005, about
1.6 billion adults were overweight, of which at least 400 million
were very fat. One of the secrets of staying thin is a good
night’s rest. Researchers in France discovered that after a bad
night’s sleep, people ate 550 calories more than normal. This
represented about one large hamburger. In an experiment,
feelings of hunger were higher among a test group who slept
four hours the previous night than among those who slept eight
hours. These results indicate that lack of sleep increases food
intake and could be a factor promoting fatness.

People don’t realize their moods are always on the run.
They think instead that their lives have suddenly become
worse in the past day, or even the last hour. So, someone
who is in a good mood in the morning might love his wife,
his job, and his car. He is probably optimistic about his
future and feels grateful about his past. But by late
afternoon, if his mood is bad, he claims he hates his job,
thinks of his wife as a trouble, thinks his car is junk, and
believes he’s going nowhere in his career. If you ask him
about his childhood while he’s in a low mood, he’ll probably
tell you it was extremely difficult.

differently, depending on their (B) state.

A friend of mine had a wife who was habitually late. He had
nagged and nagged his wife about her being late, but nothing
changed. Finally, he realized he could not change her; he could
only change his response to her. Tired of suffering the
consequences of her behavior, he decided to give them back to
her.
One night they had plans to go to a dinner party, and he did not
want to be late. In advance, he told her that he wanted to be on
time and that if she were not ready by 6:00 P.M., he would leave
without her. She was late, and he left. When he came home that
night, she screamed, “How could you leave without me!” He let
her know that her was what caused her to miss
the dinner party. He also added that he was sad to have to go
alone, but he did not want to miss the dinner. After a few more
incidents like this, she knew that if she was late it would affect
her and not him, and she changed.
