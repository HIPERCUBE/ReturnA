43. Apa, the climber, has stood on top of the world more times
than anyone in history, and now he is heading back up Mt.
Everest, not for the fame, but in the name of environmental
protection. Apa has become increasingly concerned about the
damage to the world’s highest mountains by both climate
change and the waste left by careless climbers. This spring
season he hopes to conquer Everest for the 19th time, and he
will use the trip to focus on how climate change is affecting the
Himalayas and also bring back down as much trash as he can
carry. He’s not doing this just to beat his own record but rather
to draw attention to the problem of global warming.
