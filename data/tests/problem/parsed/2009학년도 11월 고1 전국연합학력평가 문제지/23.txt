Using computers, scientists were able to create artificial
voices by digitally processing real voice sounds. ① By the
1970s, these computer-generated voices were widely used.
② Although these early voices were understandable, they had a
robotic sound. ③ Coming up with more natural-sounding
voices was a challenge because of the complex nature of
language. ④Voice recognition systems were welcomed in the
computer industry. ⑤To overcome this challenge and produce
natural-sounding voices, scientists needed to simulate the
individual sounds of a language.
