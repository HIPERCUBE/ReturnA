(A) “Ouch, something is biting my foot!” I cried, falling to
the ground. My teacher, Ms. Bell, hurried over and (a) she
quickly inspected my right foot. “Take off your shoe,”
instructed Ms. Bell, but then I remembered my socks. Despite
my pain, I wouldn’t let Ms. Bell take off my shoe.
Unfortunately, holes in socks were common in my family and I
was ashamed of them.
(B) I knew that Ms. Angela had saved my pride with the
sock-eating ant story she made. She’d seen that I would rather
be stung to death than let others see my poverty.　 (b) This
insightful teacher had taught me a lesson of compassion that I
have tried to apply in my thirty years of teaching.
(C) Ms. Angela looked into my red eyes. (c) “I have had bites
from this type of ant before: sock-eaters. They ate half my
sock!” she said. (d) She took off my shoe. “Just what I thought,
those ants have eaten part of your sock,” she said. Ms. Angela
shook my shoe. Two red ants fell out. Ms. Angela smiled at me.
(D) Ms. Bell took me to the principal’s office. “Something is
stinging her, but she won’t let me take off her shoe,” Ms. Bell
said to Mr. Stewart. He had almost managed to take off my
shoe but then I saw the hole, so I grabbed my shoe and held
tight. Just then, (e)Ms. Angela, a fifth-grade teacher entered the
office.
