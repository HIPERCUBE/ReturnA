39. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005, about
1.6 billion adults were overweight, of which at least 400 million
were very fat. One of the secrets of staying thin is a good
night’s rest. Researchers in France discovered that after a bad
night’s sleep, people ate 550 calories more than normal. This
represented about one large hamburger. In an experiment,
feelings of hunger were higher among a test group who slept
four hours the previous night than among those who slept eight
hours. These results indicate that lack of sleep increases food
intake and could be a factor promoting fatness.
