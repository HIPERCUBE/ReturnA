In the 1650s, people believed that flies formed naturally from
decaying meat. Through an experiment, however, Francesco
Redi proved this belief false. He placed the same decaying
meat on the ① bottom of each of three jars. The first jar was
left ② closed. The second jar was ③ covered with cheese cloth
with tiny holes in it. The third jar was covered tightly with a
parchment. Later, Redi found flies ④ inside the open jar and
around the cheese cloth of the second jar. However, no flies
appeared around the jar ⑤ sealed with a parchment. Redi
concluded that flies do not come from decaying meat, but from
the eggs laid by female flies.
