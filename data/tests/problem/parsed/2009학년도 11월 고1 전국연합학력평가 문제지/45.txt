말을바르게짝지은것은?
People don’t realize their moods are always on the run.
They think instead that their lives have suddenly become
worse in the past day, or even the last hour. So, someone
who is in a good mood in the morning might love his wife,
his job, and his car. He is probably optimistic about his
future and feels grateful about his past. But by late
afternoon, if his mood is bad, he claims he hates his job,
thinks of his wife as a trouble, thinks his car is junk, and
believes he’s going nowhere in his career. If you ask him
about his childhood while he’s in a low mood, he’ll probably
tell you it was extremely difficult.

① same …… emotional
