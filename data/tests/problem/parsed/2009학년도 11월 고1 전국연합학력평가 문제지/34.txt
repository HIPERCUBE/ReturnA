34. The human body shows various responses to stress. When a
person experiences stress, the brain releases stress hormones.
The hormones signal blood to move to the heart and other
organs. People experiencing stress might suddenly feel hot.
Their heart may beat faster and their muscles may tense. Their
hands and feet might feel cold. Their senses may become
sharper. People might feel like they can smell, see, and taste
things more clearly. Once the factor causing stress disappears,
the stress hormones quiet down. The body gradually goes back
to normal.
