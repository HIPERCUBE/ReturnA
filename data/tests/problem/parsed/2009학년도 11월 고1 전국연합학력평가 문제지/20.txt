As many of you have heard, I have accepted a position to be
president of a college located in Philadelphia. It will be an
honor to lead it. My reason for leaving this museum is
personal. Love, really. My wife, Mary moved to Washington
D.C. last spring. My two daughters also live there. We will
make Philadelphia our primary residence. I am confident that
the next president will lead the museum successfully. I plan to
be here until mid-January and hope to see each of you at the
museum before then. I am honored to have been president of
this museum and to have had your help in caring for it.
