At a burning building in New York City, a little girl was
trapped in her fourth-floor apartment. The firefighters trying
to rescue her were running about in confusion. They couldn’t
fit the ladder truck between the buildings. They also couldn’t
get her to jump into a net because she was so scared. They
just didn’t know what to do. Finally, her father arrived and
shouted that there was a net and that she had to jump on his
command. The girl jumped and fortunately she did not break a
bone or even strain a muscle. All the firefighters on the scene
cried out, “Hurrah! You did it!” with their thumbs up.
