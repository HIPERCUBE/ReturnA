Lampedusa is one of the Mediterranean islands, situated

prisoners to Lampedusa in the middle of the 19th century but
in recent history, it has become a place of international
tourism. It is treasured by visitors for its fine white sandy
beaches and its excellent scuba diving. As it lies between
Europe and Africa, Lampedusa has been influenced by both
continents, forming similar culture to both continents’ cultures.
It is connected to Sicily by a ferry service and it also has a
small domestic airport which operates mainly during the
summer period.
