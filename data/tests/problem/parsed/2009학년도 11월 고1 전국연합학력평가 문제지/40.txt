40. Many people try to improve their lives by dealing with the
external fruit. They deal with the fruit of their lives, trying to
change bad habits or negative personalities. But the truth is,
unless they get to the root, they will never be able to change
the fruit. As long as that bitter root is growing on the inside,
that problem will persist and keep popping up. You may be able
to control your behavior for a short time, but have you ever
wondered why you can’t really get free? You have to go
deeper. If you get to the root, you’ll be able to deal with the
problem and truly begin to change your life.
