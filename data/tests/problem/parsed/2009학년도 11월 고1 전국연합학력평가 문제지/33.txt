33. There are a great number of nannies working in American
homes. Nannies are basically the women who take care of
young children in the children’s own homes. Recently, the
demand for nannies has risen sharply. This has made wages go
up and increased competition. This trend created a new class of
nannies: highly-educated nannies. These nannies may have
advanced degrees and experiences as educators. The roles of
these highly-educated nannies are not only mother’s helpers,
but also educators and advisers for the children. Nowadays the
new nannies are important caregivers during the workday.
