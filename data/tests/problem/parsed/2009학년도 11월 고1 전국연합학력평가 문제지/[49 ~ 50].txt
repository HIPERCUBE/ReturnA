A friend of mine had a wife who was habitually late. He had
nagged and nagged his wife about her being late, but nothing
changed. Finally, he realized he could not change her; he could
only change his response to her. Tired of suffering the
consequences of her behavior, he decided to give them back to
her.
One night they had plans to go to a dinner party, and he did not
want to be late. In advance, he told her that he wanted to be on
time and that if she were not ready by 6:00 P.M., he would leave
without her. She was late, and he left. When he came home that
night, she screamed, “How could you leave without me!” He let
her know that her was what caused her to miss
the dinner party. He also added that he was sad to have to go
alone, but he did not want to miss the dinner. After a few more
incidents like this, she knew that if she was late it would affect
her and not him, and she changed.
