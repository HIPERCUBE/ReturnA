Many people think the success of dieting depends
mostly on determination, persistence and self­discipline.
While this mental power matters, a new research has
found that a much more subtle aspect of the diets
themselves can also have a big influence on the pounds
lost. Researchers compared the dieting behavior of
women following two very different diet plans. They
found that the more complicated people thought their
diet plan was, the sooner they were likely to drop it. In
other words, for people who go on a more complex diet
that involves keeping track of quantities and items eaten,
their subjective impression of the difficulty of the diet
can lead them to give up on it.

it out is more important than (B) .
(A) (B)
① simplicity necessity
② simplicity willpower
