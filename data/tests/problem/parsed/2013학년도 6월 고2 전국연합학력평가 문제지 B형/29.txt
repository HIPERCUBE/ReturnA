The graph above shows the predicted numbers of
hurricanes and the actual numbers of hurricanes from 2002
to 2007. ① For the first two years, the predicted number
of hurricanes was higher than the actual number of
hurricanes. ② In 2004 and 2005, however, the actual
number of hurricanes exceeded the predicted number of
hurricanes. ③ And in 2006 and 2007, it was reversed
again: The predicted number of hurricanes was more than
the actual number of hurricanes. ④ The year when the
fewest hurricanes were predicted to occur saw the highest
number of hurricanes. ⑤ Meanwhile, the year when the
most hurricanes were predicted to occur had the lowest
number of hurricanes.
