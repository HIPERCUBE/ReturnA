Dr. Vaigyanik is a rare scientist who wears baggy trousers
and a dirty gown. But ① he is more scientific than you
would imagine him to be. One day when it was raining cats
and dogs, ② he wanted to pay a visit to one of his friends,
Dr. Manchala. However, neither an umbrella nor a raincoat
was available in the house. But Dr. Vaigyanik had an idea.
③ He took out some old clothes and sewed them in the
form of a raincoat. When he wore it, he asked his servant
to paint it with a brush. ④ He painted the raincoat just as
one paints a door! Dr. Vaigyanik then stood for some time
before a heater and went outside. You can just imagine what
⑤ he must have looked like in the street!
