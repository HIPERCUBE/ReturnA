(A)
When I was seven, I was admitted to the hospital for
asthma. The treatment involved swallowing pills. My
parents both worked, and were unable to stay with me
at night or take time off to sit with me during the day.
I was alone and terrified and I remember crying myself
to sleep.
(B)
She soon left and I never saw her again. I was too
young to remember to ask (a) her name and many years
later, when I told the story to my father, he had no idea
who I was referring to. That stranger’s brief visit shines
as the only bright spot in a memory that was the most
terrifying and lonely experience of my childhood. How I
wish I could tell (b) her that even twenty­six years
later, her kindness has never been forgotten.
(C)
The worst part of the day was when the nurses
brought my pills. I would turn my head and resist taking
them. I ended up sobbing and couldn’t get the pills
down. On the second day of my stay, a stranger entered
the room quietly. (c) She brought me a coloring book
and some markers, and told me she was a client at my
father’s animal clinic. She worked in the hospital where I
was, so she dropped in to say hello.
(D)
She wasn’t there only for a minute when my pills were
brought to me. I started to sob. She introduced herself to
the nurse and offered to sit with me while I took them.
The nurse was obviously relieved when (d) she left us to
it. The woman explained in great detail, but with no
hurry, about how one should go about swallowing a pill.
(e) She waited for what must have been more than half
an hour. Finally I gathered up the courage to take that
pill and swallowed it.
