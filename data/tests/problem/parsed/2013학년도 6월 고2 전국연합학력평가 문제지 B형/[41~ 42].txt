What a delicious feeling it must be to get up in the
morning with “nothing to do!” To most of us it is a treat
that comes very few times after childhood― just a day
or two in the year. There is no need to go off on a long
tour, to climb mountains, and to sail on rivers. We are
able to sleep as long as we like in the morning, to dress
as leisurely as we please and then to go down quietly
through the day, having absolutely nothing to do but to
please ourselves. It is the very extreme of pleasure to
lie down beneath an old oak tree upon a breezy hill, and
hear the wind rustling among the leaves.
Moreover, the idle days are not . We have
time to think of other people when the general strain is
relaxed. We grow pitiful towards our hard­worked
brothers and sisters, and think how happy it would make
us to see them all with nothing to do for a few days. Of
course, many of them would soon get tired of it; but
surely it would be helpful to make them feel glad to
start their work again, about which they have complained
three hundred days of every year. Let as many of us as
possible take this great pleasure of nothing to do for a
day or two at least. We shall go back to our work
happily after it.
