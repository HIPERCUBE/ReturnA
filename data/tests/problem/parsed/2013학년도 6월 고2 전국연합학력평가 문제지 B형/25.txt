Sometimes we find a piece of writing hard to understand
and we need to make the meaning clear, which is possible
through simulation. A classic example is car insurance
people. They read the reports of accidents and have to
figure out who is legally responsible for the accidents. While
nowadays they probably use computer simulation, at one
time they would use toy cars and drawings of the roads.
They would move the toy cars and note the damage that
would occur according to the reports from the drivers
making claims. In this case the simulation makes the written
material more understandable by presenting it in a visual
way. To study a text better, you can use simulation with
any convenient objects.
