36. In Roy H. William’s book Free the Beagle, he asks readers
to imagine that their left brain is a lawyer and their right
brain is the lawyer’s pet beagle. The beagle runs over and
drops something at the feet of the lawyer. The lawyer says,
“I don’t have time to play right now. I’m trying to
concentrate.” But the beagle was bringing the lawyer a clue
to help him with his work, but the beagle cannot speak and
explain his gift. Unfortunately, the lawyer doesn’t realize the
significance of the beagle’s gift. He thinks that his intellect
is enough to solve the problem and ignores the beagle’s
assistance. The left brain thinks like the lawyer. The left
brain has an ego. Don’t ever let anyone convince you that
, though, because if that is true, half of
your brain exists for no reason at all. [3점]
