31. No one else can experience the way your heart feels
about things. No one can see through the lens you use to
see life quite the same as you do. Accept this .
Honor and praise it, too. Do not be quick to compromise it.
In your desire to fit in or make others happy, you may be
tempted to pretend to be someone you are not. You may
even pretend to believe things you don’t really believe, or
act in ways that are out of character with who you really
are. When you do this, you lose out on the real you. The
world loses out on you, too. Strive to be a healthy, happy
and enlightened person― and then, taking your place
alongside your fellow travelers, offer your self to the
waiting world.
