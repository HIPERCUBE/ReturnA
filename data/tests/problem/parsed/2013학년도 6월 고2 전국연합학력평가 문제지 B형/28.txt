않은 것은? [3점]
Getting an “F” means only that you failed a test― not that
you failed your life. From now on, imagine that the letter
“F” when used as a grade ① represents the word: feedback.
An “F” is an indication that you didn’t understand the
material well enough. It’s a message that you should do
something ② differently before the next test. If you think of
“F” as feedback, you can change your thinking and behavior
in ways that ③prevent your success. You can choose a new
learning strategy. Getting meaningful feedback on your
performance is a powerful strategy for learning anything.
Tests are not the only ④ source of feedback. Make a habit
of asking for feedback from your teachers, friends, and
anyone else who knows you. Just determine what you want
to ⑤ improve and ask, “How am I doing?”
