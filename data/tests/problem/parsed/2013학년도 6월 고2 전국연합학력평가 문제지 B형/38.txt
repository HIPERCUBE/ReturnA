38. 주어진 문장 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
One interesting way to start conversations in your
social networking site is to post something controversial.
(A) This is nothing personal against you or your content; it
is human nature. What you can do in this situation is,
offline, ask close friends or colleagues to be the first to
make a comment.
(B) People will respond more often to controversial topics
than to noncontroversial ones. Keep in mind, though, that
often people don’t want to be the first person to answer
a question or to comment on a controversial post.
(C) Then you can respond to the comments, and visitors to
your social networking site will see that you indeed are
there and are responding to the comments.
