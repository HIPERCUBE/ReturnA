32. Many of the biggest stars in sports are tough to deal with
and rarely does an agent develop a connection with them
during the first encounter. The most important lesson I
learned as a sports agent is that it isn’t just about signing a
million­dollar contract. When I am working with a client,
there are hundreds of little things that take place during the
weeks before we are ready to sit down and negotiate. Small
stuff plays a big part in how satisfied and comfortable my
clients are with me and my services. I often express
interest in their recent vacation or how their children are
doing in school. Paying attention to is a huge
sign of respect to today’s top athletes.
