23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
If children were required to excel only in certain areas,
they might be better able to cope with their parents’
expectations. Psychologist Michael Thompson says that we
make unfair “genetic” demands on our teens: “It is the only
period in your life when you’re expected to do all things
well. Adults don’t hold themselves to those standards. We
don’t interview the dentist about whether he can throw a
basketball, or quiz our accountant on biology before we let
her do our taxes. In elementary and high school we
celebrate the generalist, but in the real world there is no
room for the generalist except on a quiz show.” We should
not expect too much from our children.
① 자녀에게 다양한 경험을 쌓게 해주어야 한다.
② 자녀에게 직업 선택의 중요성을 일깨워주어야 한다.
③ 자녀의 생각이 부모와 다를 수 있음을 인정해야 한다.
④ 자녀가 여러 방면에서 뛰어나기를 기대해서는 안 된다.
⑤ 지나친 조기교육은 자녀의 창의성 계발에 바람직하지 않다.
24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
We need to be careful when we use general terms to
identify groups. In some cases, they make distinctions
among the subgroups unclear. For example, people from both
Guatemala and Mexico may be described as Latinos.
However, their cultural backgrounds vary on several
important dimensions, so we should not view them as being
from a homogeneous group. Similarly, the term Asian
American blurs variations among people whose heritage is,
for example, Chinese, Korean, or Japanese. Whenever the
subgroups have been identified, we will use the more
specific terms. When we use the more general terms,
remember that they may not apply to all subgroups within
the group described by the more general terms.
* homogeneous: 동질의
① 포괄적인 용어는 하위 집단 간의 차이를 모호하게 할 수 있다.
② 문화 교류를 통하여 민족 간의 화합을 도모할 수 있다.
③ 훌륭한 전통문화를 계승하고 발전시켜 나가야 한다.
④ 각 나라의 고유한 문화를 존중할 필요가 있다.
⑤ 국적을 이유로 사람을 차별해서는 안 된다.
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Sometimes we find a piece of writing hard to understand
and we need to make the meaning clear, which is possible
through simulation. A classic example is car insurance
people. They read the reports of accidents and have to
figure out who is legally responsible for the accidents. While
nowadays they probably use computer simulation, at one
time they would use toy cars and drawings of the roads.
They would move the toy cars and note the damage that
would occur according to the reports from the drivers
making claims. In this case the simulation makes the written
material more understandable by presenting it in a visual
way. To study a text better, you can use simulation with
any convenient objects.
① Complexity of Writing Process
② Limits of Simulation Technology
③ How to Expand Word Knowledge
④ Understanding Texts Through Simulation
⑤ Recording and Reporting Accidents
26. 밑줄 친 he[He]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Dr. Vaigyanik is a rare scientist who wears baggy trousers
and a dirty gown. But ① he is more scientific than you
would imagine him to be. One day when it was raining cats
and dogs, ② he wanted to pay a visit to one of his friends,
Dr. Manchala. However, neither an umbrella nor a raincoat
was available in the house. But Dr. Vaigyanik had an idea.
③ He took out some old clothes and sewed them in the
form of a raincoat. When he wore it, he asked his servant
to paint it with a brush. ④ He painted the raincoat just as
one paints a door! Dr. Vaigyanik then stood for some time
before a heater and went outside. You can just imagine what
⑤ he must have looked like in the street!
27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
When talking in general about Roman women, things break
down by time periods and by classes. Whether a woman was
a slave or ① came from a wealthier class made a great deal
of difference. It also made a difference ②which period
you’re talking about. Rome’s conquests meant ③ that men
were often away for long periods of time and might not
come back at all. Women were ④ left in charge of making
sure that things got done. After the conquests, the enormous
wealth ⑤bringing back to Italy allowed middle­ and
upper­class women to run things with more independence
and power.
28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지
않은 것은? [3점]
Getting an “F” means only that you failed a test― not that
you failed your life. From now on, imagine that the letter
“F” when used as a grade ① represents the word: feedback.
An “F” is an indication that you didn’t understand the
material well enough. It’s a message that you should do
something ② differently before the next test. If you think of
“F” as feedback, you can change your thinking and behavior
in ways that ③prevent your success. You can choose a new
learning strategy. Getting meaningful feedback on your
performance is a powerful strategy for learning anything.
Tests are not the only ④ source of feedback. Make a habit
of asking for feedback from your teachers, friends, and
anyone else who knows you. Just determine what you want
to ⑤ improve and ask, “How am I doing?”
29. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The graph above shows the predicted numbers of
hurricanes and the actual numbers of hurricanes from 2002
to 2007. ① For the first two years, the predicted number
of hurricanes was higher than the actual number of
hurricanes. ② In 2004 and 2005, however, the actual
number of hurricanes exceeded the predicted number of
hurricanes. ③ And in 2006 and 2007, it was reversed
again: The predicted number of hurricanes was more than
the actual number of hurricanes. ④ The year when the
fewest hurricanes were predicted to occur saw the highest
number of hurricanes. ⑤ Meanwhile, the year when the
most hurricanes were predicted to occur had the lowest
number of hurricanes.
30. traveler’s palm에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The traveler’s palm is a species of plant native to the
island of Madagascar which is off the coast of east Africa in
the Indian Ocean. It has been given the name “traveler’s
palm” because its long stems with green leaves on the top
of them extend out from the trunk like a giant hand fan.
Young traveler’s palms have an underground trunk which, in
the adult plant, emerges above ground. A mature traveler’s
palm blooms year round and produces brown fruits that
contain light blue seeds. The traveler’s palm tolerates sandy
soils with stores of water in many parts of the plant
including the leaf. It thrives and grows best in full sun, so it
requires a lot of light, especially when grown indoors.
① 마다가스카르 섬이 원산지인 식물이다.
② 녹색 잎이 달린 긴 줄기들이 부채 모양으로 뻗어 있다.
③ 옅은 파란색 씨앗이 들어 있는 갈색 열매를 맺는다.
④ 잎을 포함한 여러 부분에 물을 저장한다.
⑤ 햇빛이 많은 곳보다는 그늘진 곳에서 더 잘 자란다.
[31~ 36] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
31. No one else can experience the way your heart feels
about things. No one can see through the lens you use to
see life quite the same as you do. Accept this .
Honor and praise it, too. Do not be quick to compromise it.
In your desire to fit in or make others happy, you may be
tempted to pretend to be someone you are not. You may
even pretend to believe things you don’t really believe, or
act in ways that are out of character with who you really
are. When you do this, you lose out on the real you. The
world loses out on you, too. Strive to be a healthy, happy
and enlightened person― and then, taking your place
alongside your fellow travelers, offer your self to the
waiting world.
① similarity
② endurance
③ generosity
④ individuality
⑤ compliment
32. Many of the biggest stars in sports are tough to deal with
and rarely does an agent develop a connection with them
during the first encounter. The most important lesson I
learned as a sports agent is that it isn’t just about signing a
million­dollar contract. When I am working with a client,
there are hundreds of little things that take place during the
weeks before we are ready to sit down and negotiate. Small
stuff plays a big part in how satisfied and comfortable my
clients are with me and my services. I often express
interest in their recent vacation or how their children are
doing in school. Paying attention to is a huge
sign of respect to today’s top athletes.
① details
② deals
③ results
④ rewards
⑤ schedules
33. One response that happens after a diagnosis of memory
loss is the tendency to when things do
not go well. Here is a good example: Jane, a woman in her
mid­sixties, recently got a call from her son, who asked her
to get a bus pass for an upcoming doctor’s visit. A couple
of days later, the son called and asked Jane if she had
gotten the bus pass. She said, with some guilt, “Oh no, I’m
sorry I forgot all about that.” Her son’s response was, “Well,
Mom, I asked you to do that just two days ago.” Jane ended
the conversation feeling upset at herself and telling herself
she “shouldn’t” have forgotten what her son had asked. But
her forgetfulness was not her fault. She could not control
the memory loss.
① avoid physical activity
② escape from reality
③ suspect others
④ blame yourself
⑤ ask for help
34. Cell phones seem to have achieved the status of
of all the electronic consumer
products. The average person in America and Britain throws
away his or her cell phone within eighteen months of
purchase, even though cell phones will last for ten years on
average. Every year more than 130 million still­working cell
phones in the United States and 15 million in Britain are
retired. Only a small fraction of them are reassembled for
reuse or exported to foreign countries. This trend isn’t
limited to both countries. Many other advanced countries
have also seen new types of cell phones replacing old ones
almost annually.
① being the least expensive
② insuring the longest warranty
③ having the shortest life cycle
④ becoming the most traditional
⑤ getting the worst quality reputation
35. Back in the 19th century, trains weren’t so easy to stop.
Engineers didn’t just step on the brakes― instead, “brakemen”
manually adjusted the speed with brake wheels on the roof of
the cars. Working on top of a moving train took
concentration: Cars rocked violently, the wind roared past,
and brakemen had to jump from car to car at top speeds.
Often they were so intensely focused that they forgot to
watch for upcoming tunnels or bridges. You can imagine what
happened when a brakeman didn’t duck. That’s where
“telltales”― a series of ropes hung over the tracks―came
in. Hung from about 100 feet from tunnels and low­hanging
bridges, the ropes would brush across the heads of brakemen
to . [3점]
① alert them of upcoming danger
② suggest they speed up the train
③ tell them to consider passengers’ safety first
④ invite them to show their skills to the public
⑤ warn them to stop the train at the right time
36. In Roy H. William’s book Free the Beagle, he asks readers
to imagine that their left brain is a lawyer and their right
brain is the lawyer’s pet beagle. The beagle runs over and
drops something at the feet of the lawyer. The lawyer says,
“I don’t have time to play right now. I’m trying to
concentrate.” But the beagle was bringing the lawyer a clue
to help him with his work, but the beagle cannot speak and
explain his gift. Unfortunately, the lawyer doesn’t realize the
significance of the beagle’s gift. He thinks that his intellect
is enough to solve the problem and ignores the beagle’s
assistance. The left brain thinks like the lawyer. The left
brain has an ego. Don’t ever let anyone convince you that
, though, because if that is true, half of
your brain exists for no reason at all. [3점]
* beagle: 비글(사냥개의 일종)
① the left brain alone is enough
② free gifts are not always good
③ the right brain gives you useful clues
④ you are more right­brained than left­brained
37. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
In nearly every culture, proverbs― communicated in
colorful and vivid language ― offer an important set of values
for members to follow. Because all people, regardless of
their culture, share common experience, many of the same
proverbs appear throughout the world. (A) , in nearly
every culture some degree of thrift and hard work is
emphasized. Hence, in Germany, the proverb states, “One
who does not honor the penny is not worthy of the dollar.”
In the United States, people are told, “A penny saved is a
penny earned.” (B) , in Japan and China, where silence
is valued, you find the Japanese proverb that states, “The
quacking duck is the first to get shot,” and the Chinese
proverb “Loud thunder brings little rain.”

② In contrast Otherwise
③ Nevertheless Similarly

38. 주어진 문장 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
One interesting way to start conversations in your
social networking site is to post something controversial.
(A) This is nothing personal against you or your content; it
is human nature. What you can do in this situation is,
offline, ask close friends or colleagues to be the first to
make a comment.
(B) People will respond more often to controversial topics
than to noncontroversial ones. Keep in mind, though, that
often people don’t want to be the first person to answer
a question or to comment on a controversial post.
(C) Then you can respond to the comments, and visitors to
your social networking site will see that you indeed are
there and are responding to the comments.

Their concern is valid, but a study shows there’s a good
news to the graying of our nation.
It is predicted that there will be more people over 60 than
under 15 in 20 years. ( ① ) It will mean an aging society
with an increasing number of old people and fewer
youngsters. ( ② ) In reality, some youngsters worry about
caring for old people while also keeping the country’s
productivity going. ( ③ ) Over the years, the older subjects
proved to have fewer negative emotions and more positive
ones compared with their younger days. ( ④ ) It means as
people age, they’re more emotionally balanced and better
able to solve highly emotional problems. ( ⑤ ) After all,
that may lead to a more stable world as well.

Many people think the success of dieting depends
mostly on determination, persistence and self­discipline.
While this mental power matters, a new research has
found that a much more subtle aspect of the diets
themselves can also have a big influence on the pounds
lost. Researchers compared the dieting behavior of
women following two very different diet plans. They
found that the more complicated people thought their
diet plan was, the sooner they were likely to drop it. In
other words, for people who go on a more complex diet
that involves keeping track of quantities and items eaten,
their subjective impression of the difficulty of the diet
can lead them to give up on it.
To succeed in diet, (A) of process for carrying
it out is more important than (B) .
(A) (B)
① simplicity necessity
② simplicity willpower

[41~ 42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
What a delicious feeling it must be to get up in the
morning with “nothing to do!” To most of us it is a treat
that comes very few times after childhood― just a day
or two in the year. There is no need to go off on a long
tour, to climb mountains, and to sail on rivers. We are
able to sleep as long as we like in the morning, to dress
as leisurely as we please and then to go down quietly
through the day, having absolutely nothing to do but to
please ourselves. It is the very extreme of pleasure to
lie down beneath an old oak tree upon a breezy hill, and
hear the wind rustling among the leaves.
Moreover, the idle days are not . We have
time to think of other people when the general strain is
relaxed. We grow pitiful towards our hard­worked
brothers and sisters, and think how happy it would make
us to see them all with nothing to do for a few days. Of
course, many of them would soon get tired of it; but
surely it would be helpful to make them feel glad to
start their work again, about which they have complained
three hundred days of every year. Let as many of us as
possible take this great pleasure of nothing to do for a
day or two at least. We shall go back to our work
happily after it.

[43 ~45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
When I was seven, I was admitted to the hospital for
asthma. The treatment involved swallowing pills. My
parents both worked, and were unable to stay with me
at night or take time off to sit with me during the day.
I was alone and terrified and I remember crying myself
to sleep.
(B)
She soon left and I never saw her again. I was too
young to remember to ask (a) her name and many years
later, when I told the story to my father, he had no idea
who I was referring to. That stranger’s brief visit shines
as the only bright spot in a memory that was the most
terrifying and lonely experience of my childhood. How I
wish I could tell (b) her that even twenty­six years
later, her kindness has never been forgotten.
(C)
The worst part of the day was when the nurses
brought my pills. I would turn my head and resist taking
them. I ended up sobbing and couldn’t get the pills
down. On the second day of my stay, a stranger entered
the room quietly. (c) She brought me a coloring book
and some markers, and told me she was a client at my
father’s animal clinic. She worked in the hospital where I
was, so she dropped in to say hello.
(D)
She wasn’t there only for a minute when my pills were
brought to me. I started to sob. She introduced herself to
the nurse and offered to sit with me while I took them.
The nurse was obviously relieved when (d) she left us to
it. The woman explained in great detail, but with no
hurry, about how one should go about swallowing a pill.
(e) She waited for what must have been more than half
an hour. Finally I gathered up the courage to take that
pill and swallowed it.
