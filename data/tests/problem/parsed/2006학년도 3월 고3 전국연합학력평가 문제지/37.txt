37. Many of the very sophisticated things we enjoy today
developed through a long period of evolution. Making
something a little better here, a little better there gradually
makes it something a lot better― even entirely different
from the original. For example, look at the history of the
automobile or any product of technological progress. With
each new model, improvements are made. Each new model
builds upon the collective creativity of previous models, so
that over time, improvements in economy, comfort, and
durability take place. Here the creativity lies in the
refinement, the step-by-step improvement, rather than in
something completely new.
