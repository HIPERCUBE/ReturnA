(A)
Even though DNA evidence has recently become
reliable, lawyers, educators, and scientists all worry
about the difficulty in proving the validity of DNA
testing to jurors. * juror 배심원
(B)
Yet, DNA evidence is valid because its foundation is
based on the unique set of genes held by each human
being― except twins, who share the same DNA. When
investigators collect specimens, such as blood and saliva,
at a crime scene, they turn (a) this evidence over to
laboratory personnel. After the specimen and the blood
or saliva of a suspect have been checked, experts can
tell whether there is a match.
(C)
In spite of this progress, however, there are concerns
that jurors have difficulty in understanding the evidence.
This concern is shared by those who want convictions―
and those who don’t. Often, (b) DNA evidence can be
used to find a person accused of a crime innocent. As
DNA research progresses, DNA may become (c) an even
more important tool in the criminal justice system than
fingerprinting.
(D)
How reliable is this process, then? Experts often say
that there’s less than a one in a billion chance (d) the
crime scene specimen could belong to anyone other than
the person whose DNA shows a match. And (e) the odds
improve as the research progresses. It’s estimated that
research will soon be able to show only one in a trillion
possibilities that the specimen could belong to anyone
other than the match.
