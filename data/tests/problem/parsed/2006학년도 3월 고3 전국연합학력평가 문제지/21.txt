Elections are held to choose a person for a particular
office. For example, seventh grade students may want to
choose a class president. Students ① interested in the
position will talk to their classmates and make posters to
let class members ② know they are running for that
office. The class will then vote by ③marking their choices
on ballots. A ballot is a piece of paper listing the
candidates for president. The votes ④ are　 counting, and
the person who gets the most votes becomes the new
class president. You may ⑤ belong to a club or organization
that nominates candidates and elects officers. Many clubs,
organizations, and businesses follow this same procedure.
