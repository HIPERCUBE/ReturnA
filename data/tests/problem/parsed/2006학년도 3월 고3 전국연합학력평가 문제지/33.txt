Nelson Mandela has become a hero in a nine-part series
of comic books based on his life. His struggle to end
apartheid and white domination in South Africa has been
depicted by five young African illustrators and cartoonists.
The books, called The Madiba Legacy Series, have the aim
of re-awakening young South Africans to the rich history of
black South Africa. About one million copies of the inaugural
book were distributed free to schools and newspapers. The
series will eventually be translated from English into South
Africa’s 10 other official languages. International publishers
are already waiting to win publishing rights.
