In a competitive business environment, the marketing
message to the consumers should be clear, concise and
correct. Whatever the medium used, nothing is more
‘incorrect’ and damaging for business than creating a poor
impression! So, many businesses need these people writing
the words with effective presentation of the message. They
write the words used in advertisements for newspapers,
radio, television, magazines, and other media. They may also
write radio and television commercials or trade journal
articles about products or services. They must be versatile
enough to adjust to each new product and medium and to
vary the language and tone of each message.
