It is well known that some cultures prefer sons to
daughters. Surveys, however, have revealed that some
people would rather have a daughter than a son.
Apparently, each of these preferences has its explanation
in the local culture.
Around the world, people who prefer sons have
common reasons. In many countries, sons are valued
because they can work to help the family earn income.
In some cultures, sons are important because the family
name will continue for another generation. This is
because the wives in these cultures take their husband’s
family name. Not only that, but having a daughter can
sometimes cause difficulty for the family. In India,
families must save a lot of money to pay as their
marriage portion when their daughter gets married.
According to a survey conducted in 2000, 　 (A) ,
people in the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Portugal, and
even the Caribbean would prefer to have daughters. The
researchers said that parents in modernizing societies do
not have the same economic reasons that exist in other
countries, so they do not need to have a son to help
make money. Instead, families in these countries want
daughters for emotional reasons. Many mothers think
they will have a better relationship with a daughter than
a son, for example. Besides, they think daughters will
take better care of them when they are old.

【 49 - 50】다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
Even though DNA evidence has recently become
reliable, lawyers, educators, and scientists all worry
about the difficulty in proving the validity of DNA
testing to jurors. * juror 배심원
(B)
Yet, DNA evidence is valid because its foundation is
based on the unique set of genes held by each human
being― except twins, who share the same DNA. When
investigators collect specimens, such as blood and saliva,
at a crime scene, they turn (a) this evidence over to
laboratory personnel. After the specimen and the blood
or saliva of a suspect have been checked, experts can
tell whether there is a match.
(C)
In spite of this progress, however, there are concerns
that jurors have difficulty in understanding the evidence.
This concern is shared by those who want convictions―
and those who don’t. Often, (b) DNA evidence can be
used to find a person accused of a crime innocent. As
DNA research progresses, DNA may become (c) an even
more important tool in the criminal justice system than
fingerprinting.
(D)
How reliable is this process, then? Experts often say
that there’s less than a one in a billion chance (d) the
crime scene specimen could belong to anyone other than
the person whose DNA shows a match. And (e) the odds
improve as the research progresses. It’s estimated that
research will soon be able to show only one in a trillion
possibilities that the specimen could belong to anyone
other than the match.
