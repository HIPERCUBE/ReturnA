【 46 - 48】다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
It is well known that some cultures prefer sons to
daughters. Surveys, however, have revealed that some
people would rather have a daughter than a son.
Apparently, each of these preferences has its explanation
in the local culture.
Around the world, people who prefer sons have
common reasons. In many countries, sons are valued
because they can work to help the family earn income.
In some cultures, sons are important because the family
name will continue for another generation. This is
because the wives in these cultures take their husband’s
family name. Not only that, but having a daughter can
sometimes cause difficulty for the family. In India,
families must save a lot of money to pay as their
marriage portion when their daughter gets married.
According to a survey conducted in 2000, 　 (A) ,
people in the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Portugal, and
even the Caribbean would prefer to have daughters. The
researchers said that parents in modernizing societies do
not have the same economic reasons that exist in other
countries, so they do not need to have a son to help
make money. Instead, families in these countries want
daughters for emotional reasons. Many mothers think
they will have a better relationship with a daughter than
a son, for example. Besides, they think daughters will
take better care of them when they are old.
