Brave skydivers leap from airplanes at great heights,
trusting that training, good equipment, and favorable weather
will carry them safely to the ground. ① Still, skydiving
successfully from, say, 9,000 feet involves more than
courage and luck; it requires real skill. ②When a skydiver
jumps out of a plane, he or she begins to fall, traveling
through the air with the parachute tightly packed and no
way to control the speed. ③A good skydiver, however,
knows when the time is right to open the parachute. ④ It is
considered by many to be one of the most dangerous
extreme sports. ⑤Then it’s up to the diver to steer the
parachute to a landing point by pulling on lines attached to
the parachute.
