We might think that most patients at sleep clinics are
being treated for sleeplessness, but that is not the case. The
majority of sleep-clinic patients suffer from ① disorders of
excessive sleep. They have ② irresistible urges to sleep
during the day, often in ③ inappropriate situations ― at
business meetings, in supermarkets, or at parties. Even more
dangerous is their failure to remain ④ awake when driving or
operating machinery. ⑤ Sleeplessness in such situations could
obviously be life-threatening.
