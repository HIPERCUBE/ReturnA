36. It is fair to say that the food used by all living things is
carbon dioxide. People are incredibly ignorant of this
fundamental fact that food is carbon dioxide. We do not
consume carbon dioxide directly, can not go to the store to
get it. And, more importantly, when we grow plants we do
not provide the carbon dioxide they consume. They just take
it out of the air. So for millions of years people have grown
and consumed plants and animals without knowing what they
were eating. This fundamental fact was only discovered in
modern times, and we still don’t understand the process
very well. Even today, most people have no idea that their
food comes essentially from carbon dioxide.
