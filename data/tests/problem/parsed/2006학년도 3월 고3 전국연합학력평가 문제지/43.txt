He rose and placed his candle on the floor, and removed
the bricks without noticing any change. The sight of the
empty hole made his heart leap violently, but the belief that
his gold was gone could not come at once. He passed his
trembling hand all about the hole, trying to think it possible
that his eyes had deceived him; then he held the candle in
the hole and examined it crazily, trembling more and more.
At last he shook so violently that he dropped the candle and
lifted his hands to his head, screaming wildly.

Once there was a Roman general who showed real
bravery. It happened that he lost a battle and was put into
prison. Yet he knew that the Romans were gaining ground
and that the enemy were afraid of being beaten in the end.
One day a ruler of the opponent came to the prison to
talk with the Roman general. “We would like to make peace
with the Romans,” he said, “We will set you free and let
you go home, if you will agree to do as we say.” “What is
that?” asked the general. “In the first place,” he said, “you
must tell the Romans about the battle which you have lost,
and you must make it plain to them that they have not
gained anything by the war. In the second place, you must
promise us that, if they will not make peace, you will come
back to your prison.”
When the general came to Rome, all the people greeted
him gladly. He talked about the war with the white-haired
Fathers who made the laws for Rome. “I was sent to ask
you to make peace,” he said. “But it will not be wise to
make peace. True, we have been beaten in a few battles,
but our army is gaining ground every day. The enemy are
afraid, and they may well be. Keep on with the war a little
while longer, and they shall surrender. Tomorrow I will
start back to prison; for I have promised.” Then he bade
them goodbye, and went back to prison to face the cruel
death which was waiting for him.
