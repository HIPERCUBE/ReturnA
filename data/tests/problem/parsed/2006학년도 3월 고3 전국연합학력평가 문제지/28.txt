measure offered 160 acres of western land free to any
American citizen who was a family head and over
twenty-one. The only conditions were that the settlers
should live on the land for five years and make
improvements to it. In the well-watered East, 160 acres
was a sizable farm. Yet in the barren West, it was barely
enough to support a family. Despite these risks, the
Homestead Act produced an explosion of settlement. Within
half a century after the passage, all western territories had
gained enough settlers― at least 60,000― to become states.

① decrease in sales
② greatness of nature
