Some years ago, a magazine conducted a survey of the
chief executive officers (CEOs) of 500 leading companies.
The goal was to try to find traits that these CEOs had in
common. Surprisingly, there weren’t many! Some of these
top executives had gone to excellent universities, others did
not. Some brought years of experience to their jobs, while
others had enjoyed a quicker rise to success. One of the
few things they shared was that, along the way, they had
each experienced a major career setback. Most of them, in
fact, had been fired from at least one job. Understandably,
many at the time felt they had been treated unfairly. In
spite of life’s unfairness and cruelties, these CEOs learned
to move beyond setbacks. We might even say that, without
confrontation with negative events, they would not be where
they are today.
