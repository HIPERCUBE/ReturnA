In a competitive business environment, the marketing
message to the consumers should be clear, concise and
correct. Whatever the medium used, nothing is more
‘incorrect’ and damaging for business than creating a poor
impression! So, many businesses need these people writing

write the words used in advertisements for newspapers,
radio, television, magazines, and other media. They may also

courage and luck; it requires real skill. ②When a skydiver
jumps out of a plane, he or she begins to fall, traveling
through the air with the parachute tightly packed and no
way to control the speed. ③A good skydiver, however,
knows when the time is right to open the parachute. ④ It is
considered by many to be one of the most dangerous
extreme sports. ⑤Then it’s up to the diver to steer the
parachute to a landing point by pulling on lines attached to
the parachute.

Money is one of mankind’s greatest tools. It is like a
refreshing mountain stream. When it spills through the
meadow, it turns everything in its path active and green. But
once obstructed, the stream and the valley dry up; the
flowers wither and die. So, too, with the money we possess.
While it flows and circulates freely, it helps many. But when
the circulation is halted by accumulating, wasting, or abusing,
money becomes a curse. The heart hardens and noble aims
become misguided. Wealth doesn’t mean a thing if it doesn’t
translate into opportunities for others.

26. In our society, the card and gift industries have come
largely to dictate when, how, and what we give for special
occasions. That’s not all bad. Many of us appreciate
remembrances for one occasion or another, such as a
birthday. But one of the peculiar effects of formalizing giving
is the sense of that has become popular.
People tend to expect certain gifts, particularly from their
partners. They may feel hurt if they don’t get them, or take
it for granted when they do. If you are the giver, it’s just
one more item on the to-do list, and in some cases, people
may even resent the necessity. [3점]

27. When consumers go to a store to buy a product, they may
feel pressured to purchase immediately. They may create
their own pressure, or the sales staff may exert pressure.
After all, their trip has taken time and effort, and the buyers
don’t want to appear indecisive. For important purchases,
however, it is often advisable to . As a
matter of fact, consumers should go home to think and weigh
their purchase decision. At home consumers are free of
external pressures exerted by the store environment and the
sales staff. Consumers can also ask themselves important
questions such as “Can I really afford this?” and “Is this the
best product I can find at this price?”
① invest a bit more time
② consult shopping catalogs
③ ask the sales staff for help
④ find a way to use your credit card
⑤ make up a shopping list beforehand
28. In 1862 Congress passed the Homestead Act. This
measure offered 160 acres of western land free to any
American citizen who was a family head and over
twenty-one. The only conditions were that the settlers
should live on the land for five years and make
improvements to it. In the well-watered East, 160 acres
was a sizable farm. Yet in the barren West, it was barely
enough to support a family. Despite these risks, the
Homestead Act produced an explosion of settlement. Within
half a century after the passage, all western territories had
gained enough settlers― at least 60,000― to become states.
As a result of the Homestead Act, most western areas
experienced .
① decrease in sales
② greatness of nature
③ vicious circle of poverty
④ unexpected culture shock
⑤ enormous population growth

Street maps are easy to read. All the streets in the map
have names. These names are listed in alphabetical order.
They are listed in the index. Sometimes the same name is
used more than once. Street maps are divided into squares.

given a number and a letter. This is called the map
reference. For example, Smith Street is A3. This means that
you can find it on the map if you look for the A3 square.

during some kind of disaster? (③ )What business processes

must review their risks and then develop options to reduce
continuity risks.

36. It is fair to say that the food used by all living things is
carbon dioxide. People are incredibly ignorant of this
fundamental fact that food is carbon dioxide. We do not
consume carbon dioxide directly, can not go to the store to
get it. And, more importantly, when we grow plants we do
not provide the carbon dioxide they consume. They just take
it out of the air. So for millions of years people have grown
and consumed plants and animals without knowing what they
were eating. This fundamental fact was only discovered in
modern times, and we still don’t understand the process
very well. Even today, most people have no idea that their
food comes essentially from carbon dioxide.
① bad effects of greenhouse gases
② ways to grow plants and animals
③ carbon dioxide as a source of food
④ measuring the carbon dioxide levels
⑤ benefits of increased food production
37. Many of the very sophisticated things we enjoy today
developed through a long period of evolution. Making
something a little better here, a little better there gradually
makes it something a lot better― even entirely different
from the original. For example, look at the history of the
automobile or any product of technological progress. With
each new model, improvements are made. Each new model
builds upon the collective creativity of previous models, so
that over time, improvements in economy, comfort, and
durability take place. Here the creativity lies in the
refinement, the step-by-step improvement, rather than in
something completely new.

With night coming on, the orange light of sunset
disappeared. It was succeeded by the light from torches,
bonfires, and lamps. The river was lit up by them and the
most fantastic transformation took place. Various churches

appeared as if they were floating in the air. Every now and

A philosopher witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of
a vessel, of which the crew and passengers all drowned. He
criticized the injustice of the Gods, thinking that the Gods
should have tried not to let so many innocent persons
perish. As he was indulging in these reflections, he found
himself surrounded by a whole army of ants, near whose
nest he was standing. Some of them climbed up and stung
him, and he immediately trampled them all to death with his
foot. At that moment, Mercury, messenger god, appeared
and said, “Have you indeed made yourself a judge of the

Some years ago, a magazine conducted a survey of the
chief executive officers (CEOs) of 500 leading companies.
The goal was to try to find traits that these CEOs had in
common. Surprisingly, there weren’t many! Some of these
top executives had gone to excellent universities, others did
not. Some brought years of experience to their jobs, while
others had enjoyed a quicker rise to success. One of the
few things they shared was that, along the way, they had
each experienced a major career setback. Most of them, in
fact, had been fired from at least one job. Understandably,
many at the time felt they had been treated unfairly. In
spite of life’s unfairness and cruelties, these CEOs learned
to move beyond setbacks. We might even say that, without
confrontation with negative events, they would not be where
they are today.

A mother of a 6-year-old boy visited a child
psychologist to discuss her son’s behavioral problems.
But his father did not attend. The psychologist asked
why. “He doesn’t believe in psychology,” the mother
replied. Many fathers are reluctant to acknowledge the
realities of their kids’ psychological health. Because men
are less likely to see psychologists for their own needs,
it’s logical that they would be less likely to think that
their children need help. They believe it’s all a matter of
control. They also believe that they ought to be able to
control their kids, and that their kids ought to be able to
control themselves. To many fathers, it’s not mental
illness; it’s bad behavior.

He rose and placed his candle on the floor, and removed
the bricks without noticing any change. The sight of the
empty hole made his heart leap violently, but the belief that
his gold was gone could not come at once. He passed his

that his eyes had deceived him; then he held the candle in

At last he shook so violently that he dropped the candle and
lifted his hands to his head, screaming wildly.

Once there was a Roman general who showed real
bravery. It happened that he lost a battle and was put into
prison. Yet he knew that the Romans were gaining ground
and that the enemy were afraid of being beaten in the end.
One day a ruler of the opponent came to the prison to
talk with the Roman general. “We would like to make peace
with the Romans,” he said, “We will set you free and let
you go home, if you will agree to do as we say.” “What is
that?” asked the general. “In the first place,” he said, “you
must tell the Romans about the battle which you have lost,
and you must make it plain to them that they have not
gained anything by the war. In the second place, you must
promise us that, if they will not make peace, you will come
back to your prison.”
When the general came to Rome, all the people greeted
him gladly. He talked about the war with the white-haired
Fathers who made the laws for Rome. “I was sent to ask
you to make peace,” he said. “But it will not be wise to
make peace. True, we have been beaten in a few battles,
but our army is gaining ground every day. The enemy are
afraid, and they may well be. Keep on with the war a little
while longer, and they shall surrender. Tomorrow I will
start back to prison; for I have promised.” Then he bade
them goodbye, and went back to prison to face the cruel
death which was waiting for him.

It is well known that some cultures prefer sons to
daughters. Surveys, however, have revealed that some
people would rather have a daughter than a son.
Apparently, each of these preferences has its explanation
in the local culture.
Around the world, people who prefer sons have
common reasons. In many countries, sons are valued
because they can work to help the family earn income.
In some cultures, sons are important because the family
name will continue for another generation. This is
because the wives in these cultures take their husband’s
family name. Not only that, but having a daughter can
sometimes cause difficulty for the family. In India,
families must save a lot of money to pay as their
marriage portion when their daughter gets married.
According to a survey conducted in 2000, 　 (A) ,
people in the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Portugal, and
even the Caribbean would prefer to have daughters. The
researchers said that parents in modernizing societies do
not have the same economic reasons that exist in other
countries, so they do not need to have a son to help
make money. Instead, families in these countries want
daughters for emotional reasons. Many mothers think
they will have a better relationship with a daughter than
a son, for example. Besides, they think daughters will
take better care of them when they are old.

(A)
Even though DNA evidence has recently become
reliable, lawyers, educators, and scientists all worry
about the difficulty in proving the validity of DNA
testing to jurors. * juror 배심원
(B)
Yet, DNA evidence is valid because its foundation is
based on the unique set of genes held by each human
being― except twins, who share the same DNA. When
investigators collect specimens, such as blood and saliva,
at a crime scene, they turn (a) this evidence over to
laboratory personnel. After the specimen and the blood
or saliva of a suspect have been checked, experts can
tell whether there is a match.
(C)
In spite of this progress, however, there are concerns
that jurors have difficulty in understanding the evidence.
This concern is shared by those who want convictions―
and those who don’t. Often, (b) DNA evidence can be
used to find a person accused of a crime innocent. As
DNA research progresses, DNA may become (c) an even

fingerprinting.
(D)
How reliable is this process, then? Experts often say
that there’s less than a one in a billion chance (d) the
