The psychologist Gary Klein tells the story of a team of 
firefighters that entered a house ① where the kitchen was on 
fire. Soon after they started hosing down the kitchen, the 
commander heard ② himself shout, “Let’s get out of here!” 
without realizing why. The floor collapsed almost immediately 
after the firefighters escaped. Only after the fact ③ did the 
commander realize that the fire had been unusually quiet and 
that his ears had been unusually hot. Together, these 
impressions prompted ④ that he called a “sixth sense of 
danger.” He had no idea what was wrong, but he knew 
something was wrong. It turned out that the heart of the fire 
⑤ had not been in the kitchen but in the basement below.
