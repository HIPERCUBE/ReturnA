(A)
My father was not an easy man but I knew that he loved 
me and took a strong interest in my education. He placed a 
high value on his experience in the Navy and believed that a 
military-style education would be good for me. So, in 
October of 1947, I attended fifth grade at Georgia Military 
Academy. Watching me having a hard time with the tough 
students, however, (a) he soon took some pity on me and 
had me enrolled in a public school in the east of Georgia the 
following year.
(B)
It was great for me to be out of the confined boarding 
school environment and I enjoyed being able to spend more 
of my free time outside and in nature. But the brighter spot 
during that time was the arrival of a 21-year-old black man 
my father hired to take care of (b) his new sailboat. His 
name was Jimmy Brown. On the day I first saw him, little did 
I know that he would be one of the most important men in 
my life.
(C)
Because of the time we spent together, we became really 
good friends. Eventually, he became like a second father to 
me. My father taught me many things, always showing (c) his 
interest in my education. But Jimmy taught me a lot more 
about nature. I loved every minute of the time I spent with 
him and he became one of my best friends. Because of my 
sincere friendship with him, I grew up without any prejudice.
(D)
My father did not think about hiring someone for his new 
boat when he bought it, indeed. But soon, (d) he realized that 
the new boat was going to be a lot of work and decided to 
hire Jimmy after several friends recommended him as a 
capable handyman. It did not take long for Jimmy to prove 
that my father’s friends were right about (e) him. My father 
trusted him more and more and allowed me to spend a lot of 
time with Jimmy.
