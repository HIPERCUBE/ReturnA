In 1775, Typhoon Lengkieki crashed across Pingelap, an 
island near the equator and only about 20 out of the island’s 
1,000 inhabitants survived. In such situations, any rare 
genetic traits may spread.
(A) One interesting thing is that those with maksun have 
proved to be skilled at night fishing, as they are 
particularly adept at seeing the faint gray flashes of fish 
swimming in the dark.
(B) One did. The gene for total color blindness hid dormant in 
the DNA of the island’s ruler. But as he and other 
survivors reproduced, and their children intermarried and 
reproduced, the rate of people with the gene on the island 
became much higher than in the outside world.
(C) The first color-blind children on Pingelap appeared in the 
1820s. As they grew, it became apparent that they could 
not see colors and many could not distinguish letters. The 
people of Pingelap began to call their color blindness 
maksun, meaning “not-see.”
