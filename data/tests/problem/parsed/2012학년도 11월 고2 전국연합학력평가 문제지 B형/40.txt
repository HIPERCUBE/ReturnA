Other people’s views and troubles can spread like a virus. 
Don’t damage yourself by adopting negative, unproductive 
attitudes when you talk with others. If you encounter a 
sorrowful friend, or a colleague who has suffered sudden 
trouble, be careful not to be overcome by the misfortune. 
Remember to discriminate between events themselves and 
your interpretations of them. Remind yourself: “What hurts 
this person is not the occurrence itself but the response he 
or she has uncritically adopted.” We do a good service to 
others by remaining detached and avoiding melodramatic 
reactions. Still, if you find yourself in a conversation with 
someone who is depressed, hurt, or frustrated, show them 
kindness and give them a sympathetic ear; just don’t allow 
yourself to be pulled down too.
