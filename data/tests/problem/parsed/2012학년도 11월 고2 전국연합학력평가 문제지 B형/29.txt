The graph above shows the result of a recent survey in which 
more than 40,000 museum visitors of different age groups were 
asked how they prefer to experience museums. ① Throughout 
all the age groups, audio tours are most preferred, followed by 
video clips, and then by computer interactions. ② Compared to 
respondents in their 30s, respondents in their 60s are more 
than twice as likely to prefer audio tours. ③ When it comes to 
video clips, respondents in their 60s favor them more than any 
other age group. ④ As for the under-30 group, their 
preference for computer interactions is higher than that of 
respondents in their 40s. ⑤ Groups in their 50s and over show 
wider differences in preference between audio tours and 
computer interactions than the younger age groups.
