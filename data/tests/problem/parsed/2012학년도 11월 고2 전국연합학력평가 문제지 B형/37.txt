If you can find a pattern, rule, or underlying principle in the 
material, you will likely be able to learn it more easily.    
(A)       , if you arrange the number 376315374264 in four 
groups of three, it is easier to remember (376-315-374
-264). The task is even easier if you can see some patterns or 
relationships among the four groups. The first three groups all 
start with 3, and the first and third groups both have a 7 next; 
the second digits in the last two groups are only one digit apart 
(7 and 6), and the last digit is the same (4). Noticing such 
patterns helps make the number more meaningful.     (B)      , 
looking for patterns in phone numbers, addresses, dates, or any 
other numbers will help you remember them. 
(A) (B)
① However …… Otherwise
