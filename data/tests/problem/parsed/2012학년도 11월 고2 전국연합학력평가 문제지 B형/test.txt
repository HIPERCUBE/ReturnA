23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Let’s say that you are training for a certain race and your 
schedule calls for a 10 percent increase in mileage this week, 
yet you’re feeling a little pain in your legs. How do you 
respond? Do you go ahead and follow the schedule, or do you 
change it? You know the right answer. Yet many runners insist 
on sticking to the printed training schedule, since they believe 
that any change will ruin their chances of running a good race. 
In fact, the opposite is true. You would benefit more by giving 
your body a chance to recover. Training schedules are built on 
the assumption that you aren’t experiencing any unusual pains 
before, during, or after the run. If pain or fatigue does strike, 
don’t hesitate to change your workouts.
① 훈련 방법을 정기적으로 수정하라.
② 훈련 결과를 분석하여 계획을 수립하라.
③ 경기 결과보다는 훈련 과정에 집중하라.
④ 신체에 이상이 생기면 훈련 계획을 조정하라.
⑤ 훈련을 점진적으로 강화하여 부상을 예방하라.
24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Most people don’t realize that both help and harm come from 
within ourselves. Instead, they look to externals, attracted by 
appearances. Wise people, on the other hand, realize that we 
are the source of everything good or bad for us. They therefore 
don’t blame and accuse others. They don’t convince people they 
are worthy, special, or distinguished. If wise people experience 
challenges, they look to themselves; if they are praised by 
others, they quietly smile to themselves, unmoved; if they are 
criticized, they don’t feel the need to defend their name. They 
exercise moderation in everything they do. They know that 
they only have to watch out for themselves and the direction of 
their own desires.

① Actions speak louder than words.
② Wisdom comes from looking inward.
③ Wise people focus on others’ merits.
④ Praise is the driving force of success.
⑤ The moderate listen to others’ advice.

25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
When selling our ideas, we tend to “overpromise” in our 
enthusiasm for our creation. In our vision of how we hope it 
will be, we leave no room for failure. The result will probably 
be disappointing. Not disastrous, but a little worse than 
expected. No one will say anything, but they just won’t trust 
you quite as much next time. Basically, you’ve blown it. If 
instead you point out the possible weaknesses and how to 
resolve them, you are not only building a trusting relationship 
with your client but you’re able to solve any problems. And if it 
does turn out the way you hoped, it is a bonus.
① Sell Your Ideas, Not Your Products
② Don’t Promise What You Can’t Deliver 
③ Push Yourself Hard to Be Enthusiastic
④ Failure: A New Opportunity for Success
⑤ Advertising: The Way to Business Profit
26. 밑줄 친 She[she]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Marcia is a creativity coach. One day an amateur artist 
came to see her because she had difficulty creating 
imaginatively. The client always wanted to have a detailed 
plan of her work before ① she could begin. Marcia offered a 
number of approaches but the client couldn’t commit to them. 
Finally, ② she asked her client to play with her painting 
tools for thirty minutes every day for a week with 
absolutely no plan in mind. ③ She asked for more direction 
but Marcia told her there were no specific directions. This 
was so far out of her comfort zone, but ④ she did play and 
had a breakthrough. Without a plan in mind, ⑤ she created a 
piece that she liked.
27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
The psychologist Gary Klein tells the story of a team of 
firefighters that entered a house ① where the kitchen was on 
fire. Soon after they started hosing down the kitchen, the 
commander heard ② himself shout, “Let’s get out of here!” 
without realizing why. The floor collapsed almost immediately 
after the firefighters escaped. Only after the fact ③ did the 
commander realize that the fire had been unusually quiet and 
that his ears had been unusually hot. Together, these 
impressions prompted ④ that he called a “sixth sense of 
danger.” He had no idea what was wrong, but he knew 
something was wrong. It turned out that the heart of the fire 
⑤ had not been in the kitchen but in the basement below.
28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 
것은? [3점]
In prehistoric times, any attempt to harness nature meant 
forcing nature against her will. Nature had to be challenged, 
usually with some form of magic or by means that were above 
nature ― that is, supernatural. Science does just the ① opposite, 
and it works within nature’s laws. The methods of science have 
largely taken away reliance on the supernatural ― but not 
entirely. The old ways ② persist full force in primitive 
cultures. They even survive in technologically advanced 
cultures too, sometimes ③ disguised as science. This is fake 
science ― pseudoscience. The characteristic of a pseudoscience 
is that it ④ lacks the key ingredients of science: evidence and 
having a test for wrongness. In pseudoscience, doubts and tests 
for possible wrongness are firmly ⑤ accepted.
29. 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The graph above shows the result of a recent survey in which 
more than 40,000 museum visitors of different age groups were 
asked how they prefer to experience museums. ① Throughout 
all the age groups, audio tours are most preferred, followed by 
video clips, and then by computer interactions. ② Compared to 
respondents in their 30s, respondents in their 60s are more 
than twice as likely to prefer audio tours. ③ When it comes to 
video clips, respondents in their 60s favor them more than any 
other age group. ④ As for the under-30 group, their 
preference for computer interactions is higher than that of 
respondents in their 40s. ⑤ Groups in their 50s and over show 
wider differences in preference between audio tours and 
computer interactions than the younger age groups.
30. Meteora에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Meteora, an area that attracts thousands of tourists from all 
over the world every year, is situated in central Greece. 
Meteora is famous for its monasteries that are built on high 
rocks. The name itself means ‘suspended in the air.’ In the past 
there were many monasteries but now only six are left. The 
climate here varies from sweaty summers to chilly winters and 
the area experiences rain all through the year. Tourists here 
can enjoy visiting monasteries, walking and exploring caves. 
The best way to reach the place is by taking a bus from 
Athens. The nearby places worth visiting are Mount Olympus, 
Kastoria, Thessaloniki and many more.
* monastery: 수도원
① 매년 수천 명이 방문하며 그리스 중부에 있다.
② 이름 자체는 공중에 매달려 있다는 의미이다.
③ 겨울에는 쌀쌀하며 비가 거의 내리지 않는다.
④ 관광객들은 걷기와 동굴 탐험을 즐길 수 있다.
⑤ 아테네에서 버스를 타고 가는 것이 가장 좋다.

31.  The essence of sports is competition. However, it is in the 
best interest of professional sports clubs for this competition 
to occur on the playing field, not in the marketplace. The 
reason is easily observable. Imagine that sports clubs 
competed for fans in purely competitive markets. The more 
successful clubs would sell more tickets and would naturally 
earn higher profits, which would allow these clubs to attract 
the best players through higher salaries. Over time, these clubs 
would become so much stronger than the less successful teams 
that competition on the playing field would become boring for 
spectators. Weak teams would eventually be forced into 
bankruptcy, and strong teams would lose fans. Therefore, a 
professional sports club’s economic decisions and those of its 
rivals are                            .
① interdependent ② conflicting
③ unintentional ④ temporary
32.  Someone who really loves us will be honest with us but will 
also tend to see us through rose-colored glasses. Sandra 
Murray and her co-workers studied dating and married 
couples. They found that the happiest were those who idealized 
each other, who even saw their partners more positively than 
their partners saw themselves. When we’re in love, we’re 
biased to find those we love not only physically attractive but 
socially attractive as well. Moreover, the most satisfied 
married couples tend to approach problems without 
immediately criticizing their partners. Honesty has its place in 
a good relationship, but so does the                   of the other’s 
basic goodness. [3점]
① abuse ② ignorance ③ presumption
④ analysis ⑤ suspicion
33.  Thinking is hard work. If you do not keep your working 
memory clear, then you are weakening your ability to think 
about what is going on in your class or meeting. This might 
seem obvious, but if you look around the room at many 
meetings, you will find yourself face-to-face with one of the 
true demons of modern life: multitasking. Sitting in a meeting, 
you will see that some people are taking care of work that is 
unrelated to the current meeting. Others are checking their 
e-mail. Still others are reading. Each of these activities takes 
up your working memory. You cannot maximize the quality of 
the new knowledge you are taking in if you do not give 
yourself every opportunity to                                .
① pay attention ② share experiences
③ boost confidence  ④ assign responsibility
⑤ develop personality
34.  An option is forced if not choosing to decide is somehow 
equivalent in its consequences to choosing not to decide. I 
recently debated buying a particular car that had just arrived at 
a local dealership. I looked at it for two days and test-drove it 
twice. I really liked it. It was an extraordinary deal because of 
some rare circumstances. But, as much as I liked it, and as 
perfect a deal as it seemed, I couldn’t manage to form the 
positive belief that I should go buy it. The situation was such 
that this was equivalent to                                                   , 
as my hesitation allowed another interested party to snatch it 
away while I pondered the possibilities. If you are presented 
with a good job offer and given 48 hours to respond, then not 
choosing is equivalent in its consequences to a negative choice. 
It is a forced option. [3점]
① deciding not to buy it
② getting the best catch
③ resulting in a better deal
④ leading to impulse buying
⑤ diminishing purchasing power
35.  When you are asked what you are thinking about, you can 
normally answer. You believe you know what goes on in your 
mind, which often consists of one conscious thought leading in 
an orderly way to another. But that is not the only way the 
mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way. Most 
impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience 
without your knowing how they got there. You cannot trace 
how you came to the belief that there is a lamp on the desk in 
front of you, or how you detected a hint of irritation in your 
spouse’s voice on the telephone, or how you managed to avoid 
a threat on the road before you became consciously aware of it. 
The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and 
many decisions                                              . [3점]
① makes us create changes
② is good for our concentration
③ goes on in silence in our mind
④ helps to increase our knowledge
⑤ reflects our experienced expertise
36.  Making $1 million in one year, but nothing in the preceding 
nine, does not bring the same pleasure as having the total 
evenly distributed over the same period, that is, $100,000 
every year for ten years in a row. The same applies to the 
inverse order ― making a bundle the first year, then nothing 
for the remaining period. Somehow, your pleasure system will 
be saturated rather quickly. As a matter of fact, your happiness 
depends far more on the number of instances of positive 
feelings, what psychologists call “positive affect,” than on their 
intensity. In other words, good news is good news first; how 
good matters rather little. So to have a pleasant life you should  
. Plenty of mildly good 
news is preferable to one single lump of great news. [3점]
① find the way to make a big fortune on a single occasion
② offer positive feedback and internal rewards for yourself
③ bear all your pain in a brief period rather than spread it out
④ live in an environment where results are corrected regularly
⑤ spread these small affects across time as evenly as possible

If you can find a pattern, rule, or underlying principle in the 
material, you will likely be able to learn it more easily.    
(A)       , if you arrange the number 376315374264 in four 
groups of three, it is easier to remember (376-315-374

relationships among the four groups. The first three groups all 
start with 3, and the first and third groups both have a 7 next; 
the second digits in the last two groups are only one digit apart 
(7 and 6), and the last digit is the same (4). Noticing such

In 1775, Typhoon Lengkieki crashed across Pingelap, an 
island near the equator and only about 20 out of the island’s 
1,000 inhabitants survived. In such situations, any rare 
genetic traits may spread.
(A) One interesting thing is that those with maksun have 
proved to be skilled at night fishing, as they are 
particularly adept at seeing the faint gray flashes of fish 
swimming in the dark.
(B) One did. The gene for total color blindness hid dormant in 
the DNA of the island’s ruler. But as he and other 
survivors reproduced, and their children intermarried and 
reproduced, the rate of people with the gene on the island 
became much higher than in the outside world.
(C) The first color-blind children on Pingelap appeared in the 
1820s. As they grew, it became apparent that they could 
not see colors and many could not distinguish letters. The 
people of Pingelap began to call their color blindness 
maksun, meaning “not-see.”

This hasn’t escaped the attention of some savvy Internet 
retailers and we are therefore starting to see the emergence 
of social shopping sites. 
E-tail is obviously a massive trend but in many ways online 
shopping is still divorced from the real world. ( ① ) Online 
supermarkets are usually just text-based lists of products ―
you can’t walk through the store. ( ②  ) Indeed, despite the 
convenience factor, online shopping has nothing in common with 
its real-world equivalent. ( ③ ) For example, online you 
generally have to know what you’re looking for and most people 
shop alone. ( ④ ) In the real world, however, shopping is 
more of an event, an experience that is usually shared, and 
customers listen to the recommendations of friends and trusted 
experts. ( ⑤ ) These are a mixture of search engines and 
social networking sites and allow shoppers to browse and buy 
based on other customers’ recommendations.

Other people’s views and troubles can spread like a virus. 
Don’t damage yourself by adopting negative, unproductive 
attitudes when you talk with others. If you encounter a 
sorrowful friend, or a colleague who has suffered sudden 
trouble, be careful not to be overcome by the misfortune. 
Remember to discriminate between events themselves and 
your interpretations of them. Remind yourself: “What hurts 
this person is not the occurrence itself but the response he 
or she has uncritically adopted.” We do a good service to 
others by remaining detached and avoiding melodramatic 
reactions. Still, if you find yourself in a conversation with 
someone who is depressed, hurt, or frustrated, show them 
kindness and give them a sympathetic ear; just don’t allow 
yourself to be pulled down too.

[41~42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Several months ago, my daughter and I were taking a walk 
with a friend and her son. My daughter was distracted by the 
sound of frogs, so she walked over to see several of them by 
the edge of the water. “Look at the frogs by the pond!” she 
exclaimed excitedly, to which my friend replied, “That’s not 
a pond, that’s a vernal pool.” Perhaps I should be 
embarrassed to admit this, but I had no idea what a vernal 
pool was any more than my daughter did. I realize that as a 
devoted naturalist and environmentalist, she was trying to 
help my child widen her knowledge of the natural world. 
However, what happened was that my young child was 
confused and distracted from the important thing, which was 
admiring the frogs and their beautiful songs. My friend’s 
good intentions of correcting my daughter’s error only 
prevented her from learning something more important on 
her own. This is the way many of us unintentionally              
opportunities in our everyday lives to help our children 
cultivate their minds. Of course, we need to give our children 
the vocabulary they need to talk about the world around 
them. However, we need to guard against our natural impulse 
to offer imprudent help to our children. They need the time, 
the silence and the mental space to think and learn things for 
themselves.

[43~45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
My father was not an easy man but I knew that he loved 
me and took a strong interest in my education. He placed a 
high value on his experience in the Navy and believed that a 
military-style education would be good for me. So, in 
October of 1947, I attended fifth grade at Georgia Military 
Academy. Watching me having a hard time with the tough 
students, however, (a) he soon took some pity on me and 
had me enrolled in a public school in the east of Georgia the 
following year.
(B)
It was great for me to be out of the confined boarding 
school environment and I enjoyed being able to spend more 
of my free time outside and in nature. But the brighter spot 
during that time was the arrival of a 21-year-old black man 
my father hired to take care of (b) his new sailboat. His 
name was Jimmy Brown. On the day I first saw him, little did 
I know that he would be one of the most important men in 
my life.
(C)
Because of the time we spent together, we became really 
good friends. Eventually, he became like a second father to 
me. My father taught me many things, always showing (c) his 
interest in my education. But Jimmy taught me a lot more 
about nature. I loved every minute of the time I spent with 
him and he became one of my best friends. Because of my 
sincere friendship with him, I grew up without any prejudice.
(D)
My father did not think about hiring someone for his new 
boat when he bought it, indeed. But soon, (d) he realized that 
the new boat was going to be a lot of work and decided to 
hire Jimmy after several friends recommended him as a 
capable handyman. It did not take long for Jimmy to prove 
that my father’s friends were right about (e) him. My father 
trusted him more and more and allowed me to spend a lot of 
time with Jimmy.
