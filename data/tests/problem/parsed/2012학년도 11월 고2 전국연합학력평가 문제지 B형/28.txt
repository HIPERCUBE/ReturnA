것은? [3점]
In prehistoric times, any attempt to harness nature meant 
forcing nature against her will. Nature had to be challenged, 
usually with some form of magic or by means that were above 
nature ― that is, supernatural. Science does just the ① opposite, 
and it works within nature’s laws. The methods of science have 
largely taken away reliance on the supernatural ― but not 
entirely. The old ways ② persist full force in primitive 
cultures. They even survive in technologically advanced 
cultures too, sometimes ③ disguised as science. This is fake 
science ― pseudoscience. The characteristic of a pseudoscience 
is that it ④ lacks the key ingredients of science: evidence and 
having a test for wrongness. In pseudoscience, doubts and tests 
for possible wrongness are firmly ⑤ accepted.
