36. Wat Xieng Thong에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Wat Xieng Thong is regarded not only as the most 
beautiful monastery in Luang Prabang, but one of the most 
delicate in all of Laos. The name Wat Xieng Thong means 
Temple of the Golden City. This temple is located close to 
the tip of the Luang Prabang peninsula, where the Nam Khan 
flows into the Mekong River. It was built by King 
Setthathirath in 1560, during the golden years of the Lan 
Xang Kingdom. Its gracefully sloping roof and glass paintings 
on the walls represent the classical Luang Prabang style of 
temple architecture. It had been supported by the kings right 
up to 1975, when the monarchy ended. It was here that the 
kings were crowned and granted their power.
