People living in the suburbs of London during World War 
II experienced an increase of stomach ulcers in response to 
the stress of being bombed by German warplanes. And yet 
Londoners, who were bombed more often, didn’t experience 
stomach ulcers that much. The explanation of this paradox 
requires an understanding of the power of uncertainty. 
People living in Central London were overwhelmed by 
nightly bombing raids, whereas those living in the suburbs 
were raided only irregularly. Objectively speaking, it is 
worse to be bombed often in the night than to be bombed 
less often. But in reality, irregular bombing feels worse 
because people become so unsure about when they will be 
exposed to the next bombing raid.

It was not the    (A)    of bombing but its     (B)     that 
made people suffer more from stomach ulcers during World 
War II. 
(A)    (B)
① region ‥‥‥ damage

A district mayor in the Japanese capital, Tokyo, is going 
on an unusual leave for the birth of his newborn baby on 
Saturday. He will be the first local government leader ever 
to do so. Hironobu Narisawa, the mayor of the central 
Bunkyo district, said he was aiming to change attitudes. 
Japanese workers are famously reluctant to take time off 
after the birth of a child even though Japanese law allows 
either parent to have up to a year off. Mr. Narisawa’s 
announcement has been front page news in Japan these days.  
No other local government leader, male or female, has 
taken time off after the birth of a child. Nationwide, just 
one in 100 fathers takes any paternity leave. None of the 
male employees of Bunkyo district has done so. Mr. 
Narisawa, whose son was born in February, said he hoped 
his              would help to change attitudes. However, 
Mr. Narisawa will not be entirely switching off from work 
during his two˗week leave. He is planning to remain in the 
district in case of emergencies.

(A) Frank was on his way to the Aspen Music School. He 
had heard wonderful stories about it and he was especially 
excited to be studying with Mr. Stessin, an esteemed 
professor from the Juilliard School. After a few lessons 
with (a) him, Frank knew that he would not be 
disappointed. The professor noticed every turn of each 
musical phrase, and added his sense of humor to every 
lesson. 
(B) Only days later, Mr. Stessin was back in his studio, 
teaching! Initially shocked by his decision to stay, Frank 
soon began to understand (b) him. He and his wife had 
been teaching at the Aspen Music School for many years 
and had built a strong sense of community with the 
faculty and students. Furthermore, Frank realized (c) he 
found comfort through his love of music and students. 
Leaving Aspen would have meant leaving behind his 
fondest memories of Nancy.
(C) As Frank was preparing Beethoven’s Sonata for a 
master class, Mr. Stessin jokingly warned him, “Don’t play 
this too well, Frank, or I’ll have nothing to say!” The 
master class went quite well, considering that it was his 
first performance of the sonata. A few days later, Frank 
met Mr. Stessin’s wife, Nancy who was also on the Aspen 
faculty. She said to (d) him, “That was a very nice 
Beethoven you played the other day.” He was touched by 
her thoughtful comment.
(D) One day, as Frank was sitting down with his friends 
to have lunch, someone whispered to him, “Mrs. Stessin 
passed out!” He naturally assumed that she had fainted 
from the heart or something. That night, he could not 
sleep knowing that she was dead. He wondered how Mr. 
Stessin could possibly cope with the terrible tragedy. 
Surely (e) he would be heading back to New York as soon 
as arrangements could be made.
