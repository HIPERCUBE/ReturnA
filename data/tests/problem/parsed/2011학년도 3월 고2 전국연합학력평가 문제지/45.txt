People living in the suburbs of London during World War 
II experienced an increase of stomach ulcers in response to 
the stress of being bombed by German warplanes. And yet 
Londoners, who were bombed more often, didn’t experience 
stomach ulcers that much. The explanation of this paradox 
requires an understanding of the power of uncertainty. 
People living in Central London were overwhelmed by 
nightly bombing raids, whereas those living in the suburbs 
were raided only irregularly. Objectively speaking, it is 
worse to be bombed often in the night than to be bombed 
less often. But in reality, irregular bombing feels worse 
because people become so unsure about when they will be 
exposed to the next bombing raid.

A district mayor in the Japanese capital, Tokyo, is going 
on an unusual leave for the birth of his newborn baby on 
Saturday. He will be the first local government leader ever 
to do so. Hironobu Narisawa, the mayor of the central 
Bunkyo district, said he was aiming to change attitudes. 
Japanese workers are famously reluctant to take time off 
after the birth of a child even though Japanese law allows 
either parent to have up to a year off. Mr. Narisawa’s 
announcement has been front page news in Japan these days.  
No other local government leader, male or female, has 
taken time off after the birth of a child. Nationwide, just 
one in 100 fathers takes any paternity leave. None of the 
male employees of Bunkyo district has done so. Mr. 
Narisawa, whose son was born in February, said he hoped 
his              would help to change attitudes. However, 
Mr. Narisawa will not be entirely switching off from work 
during his two˗week leave. He is planning to remain in the 
district in case of emergencies.
