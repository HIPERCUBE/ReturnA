37. Ben Schneider에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Ben Schneider was the son of an anthropology professor and 
a sociology professor. To the surprise of his bookish parents, 
his favorite childhood possession was a workbench. Thanks in 
part to that, he developed an early passion for carpentry and 
an ability to do impressive things with wood. During his 20s, 
when he worked as an actor, Mr. Schneider could make ends 
meet by making furniture and doing carpentry. In 2002, he 
bought a very old house that was ready to collapse for 
$435,000. With his own hands, he reassembled, repaired, and 
restored the tumbledown house to create a spacious dwelling.
