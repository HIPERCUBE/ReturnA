The U. S. space agency NASA is currently on the Hundred 
Years Starship, a project of exploring new habitable planets 
and ① helping people settle down there. If settlers succeed 
in making ② another planet their home, it will become one of 
the most revolutionary events in history. ③ Assumed to have 
a substantial amount of water, Mars is probably most 
habitable out of all the planets in our solar system. However, 
this project would take time since the cost will make a 
return flight to Earth almost ④ impossible. Although the 
living supplies for the settlers would ⑤ send from Earth,
