34. Errold Reid of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New 
York City and his colleagues studied piano players who had 
been playing for at least 10 years. Eleven of the players 
experienced varying degrees of piano ̵related discomfort; 21 
were pain˗free. The researchers found that no postural 
differences were evident in the two groups, but the players 
who were pain˗free relied heavily on their back and neck 
muscles. Conversely, players who experienced pain used 
smaller muscles in their forearms more. According to the 
study, not using the strong back muscles shifts the work to 
the smaller, more delicate muscles in the fingers and arms, 
which is too hard on those little muscles.
