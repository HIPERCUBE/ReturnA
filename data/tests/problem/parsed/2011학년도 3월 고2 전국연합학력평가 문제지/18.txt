It was a Saturday morning and we looked around to see 
the breakfast club full of happy, smiling children. Each of 
them was talking and laughing, completely forgetting the fact 
that they were disadvantaged. How wonderful it is to see 
them smile! We are so thankful for your donations that have 
helped make it happen. Your contribution has helped so much, 
but the need is still great. Each year, we help thousands of 
children by giving them a proper breakfast and somewhere 
safe to play after school. Without donations like yours, 
however, our center would not have enough funds to keep 
operating. Together we are transforming lives and building 
brighter futures, but without you, it wouldn’t be possible.
