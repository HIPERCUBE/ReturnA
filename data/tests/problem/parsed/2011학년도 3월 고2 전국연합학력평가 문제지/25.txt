25. We all cherish certain memories of our childhoods, like 
birthday parties and bike rides. But can you remember being 
born? In fact, can you remember much before the age of

Newborn babies cannot express experiences or emotions in 
the form of words or symbols that others can understand.

order to remember it. Therefore, as babies don’t have words 
to describe being born, there is no way they can accurately 
remember that experience later.

③ experiences in babyhood ④ a result of forgetfulness
⑤ an absence of intelligence
