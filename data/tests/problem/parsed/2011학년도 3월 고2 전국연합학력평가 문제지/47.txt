(A) Frank was on his way to the Aspen Music School. He 
had heard wonderful stories about it and he was especially 
excited to be studying with Mr. Stessin, an esteemed 
professor from the Juilliard School. After a few lessons 
with (a) him, Frank knew that he would not be 
disappointed. The professor noticed every turn of each 
musical phrase, and added his sense of humor to every 
lesson. 
(B) Only days later, Mr. Stessin was back in his studio, 
teaching! Initially shocked by his decision to stay, Frank 
soon began to understand (b) him. He and his wife had 
been teaching at the Aspen Music School for many years 
and had built a strong sense of community with the 
faculty and students. Furthermore, Frank realized (c) he 
found comfort through his love of music and students. 
Leaving Aspen would have meant leaving behind his 
fondest memories of Nancy.
(C) As Frank was preparing Beethoven’s Sonata for a 
master class, Mr. Stessin jokingly warned him, “Don’t play 
this too well, Frank, or I’ll have nothing to say!” The 
master class went quite well, considering that it was his 
first performance of the sonata. A few days later, Frank 
met Mr. Stessin’s wife, Nancy who was also on the Aspen 
faculty. She said to (d) him, “That was a very nice 
Beethoven you played the other day.” He was touched by 
her thoughtful comment.
(D) One day, as Frank was sitting down with his friends 
to have lunch, someone whispered to him, “Mrs. Stessin 
passed out!” He naturally assumed that she had fainted 
from the heart or something. That night, he could not 
sleep knowing that she was dead. He wondered how Mr. 
Stessin could possibly cope with the terrible tragedy. 
Surely (e) he would be heading back to New York as soon 
as arrangements could be made.
