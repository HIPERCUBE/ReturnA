35. Fast˗food chains are tempting children towards their 
products by sending direct mail to children under 12 years 
of age and offering them free meals for their birthdays. 
The marketing campaigns targeting pre˗teens by fast˗food 
restaurants have been revealed thanks to a report in the 
government’s inquiry into privacy laws. Civil organizations 
have asked the federal government to ban direct mail 
marketing to children without the consent of their parents. 
The report says that children’s susceptibility to commercial 
influence means that the use of their personal information 
for direct marketing unfairly manipulates them, and is likely 
to harm them in other ways. It also adds that such 
promotional activities could influence children to have 
unhealthy diets.                        * susceptibility: 취약성
