It was a Saturday morning and we looked around to see 
the breakfast club full of happy, smiling children. Each of 
them was talking and laughing, completely forgetting the fact 
that they were disadvantaged. How wonderful it is to see 
them smile! We are so thankful for your donations that have 
helped make it happen. Your contribution has helped so much, 
but the need is still great. Each year, we help thousands of 
children by giving them a proper breakfast and somewhere 
safe to play after school. Without donations like yours, 
however, our center would not have enough funds to keep 
operating. Together we are transforming lives and building 
brighter futures, but without you, it wouldn’t be possible.

Gabriella rechecked her own calculation and murmured, 
“That should be sixteen over pi.” She thought ① she had 
said it quietly, but apparently not quietly enough. Mrs. Baker 
turned around. “Yes, Gabriella?” “Oh, I’m sorry. I was just ... 
Shouldn’t the second equation read sixteen over pi?” ② she 
said, embarrassed. “Sixteen over pi?” the teacher said in 
surprise. ③ She took out a calculator and started punching in 
numbers, saying “That’s quite impossible!” There was a brief 
pause. Mrs. Baker said to the class, “④ She’s right.” She 
turned back to the blackboard to revise her work. Then she 
looked over her shoulder, smiled warmly at Gabriella, and 
added, “How brilliant!” ⑤ She blushed, impressed by her 
teacher’s remark.

The U. S. space agency NASA is currently on the Hundred 
Years Starship, a project of exploring new habitable planets 
and ① helping people settle down there. If settlers succeed 
in making ② another planet their home, it will become one of 
the most revolutionary events in history. ③ Assumed to have 
a substantial amount of water, Mars is probably most 
habitable out of all the planets in our solar system. However, 
this project would take time since the cost will make a 
return flight to Earth almost ④ impossible. Although the 
living supplies for the settlers would ⑤ send from Earth, 
taking the risk of exchanging life for dreams is tough.

There are lots of myths about taking care of bad breath. 
Here are two things you may have heard about bad breath 
that (A) is / are  not true. One of them is that 
mouthwash will make bad breath go away. Mouthwash only 
gets rid of it temporarily. If you do use mouthwash, look 
for an antiseptic and plaque˗reducing one. Secondly, as long 
as you brush your teeth, you are said not to have bad 
breath. The truth is (B) that / what  most people only 
brush their teeth for 30 to 45 seconds, which just doesn’t 
solve the problem. To sufficiently clean your teeth, you 
should brush for at least 2 minutes at least twice a day. 
Remember (C) brushing / to brush  your tongue, too.
* antiseptic: 살균성분이 있는

① is …… that …… brushing
② is …… what …… to brush
③ are …… what …… brushing
④ are …… that …… brushing
⑤ are …… that …… to brush
22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
A boom in car sales has caused traffic jams in many of 
China’s major cities. One company wants to improve the 
situation ― by putting even more people on the road. ① But 
rather than adding more cars, Shenzhen Huashi Future 
Parking Equipment is developing a massive “straddling bus.” 
② The bus will span two lanes and carry up to 1,200 people 
in a carriage raised 7 feet above the roadway. ③ Thus, it 
will allow cars to pass underneath, and passengers on the 
new bus should expect to feel above it all. ④ Beijing will 
build more subways and put more buses on roads to boost 
public transportation. ⑤ If the company can get government 
approval for a trial project, test runs could begin by the end 
of 2011. 
23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
We often look to a few leaders to improve our 
communities, and unfortunately, we also blame those same 
people for anything that needs to be changed. It’s easy to 
blame the principal or teachers if there are problems at your 
school. Many people blame the mayor for anything that goes 
wrong in a city or town. But a community needs everyone’s 
involvement to become great. It’s important to take 
ownership of your community and put the YOU in 
community. How can you do that? Volunteer. Give feedback. 
Talk to others in your community. Work to bring about 
change. Ask how you can help.

[24 ～ 29] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 
24. To the majority of people, Einstein’s theory is a           
. Their attitude towards Einstein is like that 
of Mark Twain towards the writer of a work on 
mathematics: Here was a man who had written an entire 
book of which Mark could not understand a single sentence. 
Einstein, therefore, is great in the public eye partly because 
he has made revolutionary discoveries which cannot be 
translated into the common tongue. We stand in proper awe 
of a man whose thoughts move on heights far beyond our 
range, whose achievements can be measured only by the 
few who are able to follow his reasoning and challenge his 
conclusions.
① useful discovery ② concrete concept
③ clear explanation ④ complete mystery
⑤ common knowledge
25. We all cherish certain memories of our childhoods, like 
birthday parties and bike rides. But can you remember being 
born? In fact, can you remember much before the age of 
two? No, in fact nobody can. So why does this occur? One 
of the most recent explanations has been                . 
Newborn babies cannot express experiences or emotions in 
the form of words or symbols that others can understand. 
Indeed, we have to have a word to explain something in 
order to remember it. Therefore, as babies don’t have words 
to describe being born, there is no way they can accurately 
remember that experience later. 
① a lack of language skills ② need for concentration
③ experiences in babyhood ④ a result of forgetfulness
⑤ an absence of intelligence
26. From a present perspective, we tend to believe that 
“artists’ individuality” is a universal thought. Thus we fail to 
imagine a place and period in which things were different. But 
there was a time when priority was given to an observance of 
tradition rather than to an artist’s personality. In medieval 
Europe, for example, the standardized backgrounds of religious 
images acted as a device to                       of the 
artists. Those images contrast the modern self˗portraits, which 
are considered to show the obvious individuality of the artists 
in brush marks. Medieval artists were little more than wage˗
earning artisans who didn’t have a chance to show their 
artistic originality.                         * observance: 준수
① ruin the reputation
② illustrate the creativity
③ exclude the individuality
④ promote self˗expression
⑤ reflect the historical view
27. Each insurance plan is different when it comes to what’s 
covered and what’s not. Figuring out which one is right for 
you is a bit of a balancing act: You want to get the most 
benefits at the least cost. Start by looking at all the 
elements of the plan and not just the price tag. For 
example, a plan with a low monthly premium isn’t 
necessarily the cheapest. Your hospital bill might be very 
high or you might pay much more for your prescriptions 
depending on your insurance. So if you see a doctor often 
or take prescription medications regularly, a more expensive 
plan that covers a higher percentage of the cost may 
actually                             . 
① be of no use to you
② turn out to be cheaper
③ cover only a few elements
④ be for long ̵term patients only
⑤ cover a longer insurance period
28. The attitude that nothing is easier than to love has 
continued to be the prevalent idea about love in spite of 
overwhelming evidence to the contrary. There is hardly any 
activity, any enterprise, which is started with such 
tremendous hopes and expectations, and yet, which fails so 
regularly, as love. If this were the case with any other 
activity, people would be eager to know why they had failed 
in it and to learn how one could do better, or they would 
abandon the activity. Since the latter is impossible in the 
case of love, there seems to be only one adequate way to 
overcome the failure of love ―                         and 
to proceed to study the meaning of love.              [3점]
① to accept their partner’s demands
② to give up the act of loving others
③ to offer help to the broken ̵hearted
④ to examine the reasons for this failure
⑤ to keep the relationship with their partners
29. There are many factors necessary to enjoy a happy life. 
Factors such as good health, consumer goods, friends, and 
so on. If you investigate these things closely, you’ll find that  
. To maintain good health, 
you rely on medicines made by others and health care 
provided by others. If you examine all of the facilities that 
you use for the enjoyment of life, you’ll find that there are 
hardly any of these material objects that have had no 
connection to other people. If you think carefully, you’ll see 
that all of these goods come into being as a result of the 
efforts of many people, either directly or indirectly.
① you cannot trust other people
② you are independent of others
③ they cannot assure your happiness
④ all of these depend on other people
⑤ these factors can be provided with money
30. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
One spring night I was sitting alone very late in the 
university library. Looking up from my work, I suddenly 
realized that someone had left a book I had never seen 
before on a shelf above my desk. Wondering what the book 
was about, I took it down and looked through it. Across two 
pages I saw a single word in Gothic lettering: DRAKULYA. I 
flipped through the rest of the pages but they were 
completely blank. After gazing at the word for a few more 
minutes, it suddenly started to scatter and reshape. All in a 
tremble, I dropped the book; it was the face of the devil.
① excited → bored ② curious → scared
③ nervous → satisfied ④ desperate → relieved
⑤ surprised → disappointed

It’s well˗known that many students use caffeine to stay up 
late to study, or to stay focused with little sleep. In fact, 
some experts report that caffeine ① dependency among 
high school students has steadily increased over the past 
five years. Most teens are ② unaware of how caffeine 
affects their bodies, even though it may seem like a quick 
solution for helping students study late into the night.  
Caffeine is a mild ③ stimulant that causes increased heart 
rate. Most people who are sensitive to caffeine experience 
a ④ permanent increase in energy and elevation in mood. 
Yet, this ⑤ energized feeling quickly evaporates and leaves 
students feeling tired and irritable.

As Africa’s exploding human populations compete with wildlife 
for land and resources, the number of lions speared, shot, and 
poisoned has soared, endangering the species.     (A)    , 
Living With Lions, founded by the NGO Panthera, has hired 
Masai men to protect lions. The tribesmen, who used to spear 
lions as a rite of passage for young Masai men, now track 
lions to save them in this area. They also educate Masai 
communities on the lions’ value because although each lion is 
reported to kill livestock worth $290 a year, it brings in 
$17,000 in tourist revenue.      (B)     , some experts warn 
that within 25 years there may be no lions left outside the

34. Errold Reid of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New 
York City and his colleagues studied piano players who had 
been playing for at least 10 years. Eleven of the players 
experienced varying degrees of piano ̵related discomfort; 21 
were pain˗free. The researchers found that no postural 
differences were evident in the two groups, but the players 
who were pain˗free relied heavily on their back and neck 
muscles. Conversely, players who experienced pain used 
smaller muscles in their forearms more. According to the 
study, not using the strong back muscles shifts the work to 
the smaller, more delicate muscles in the fingers and arms, 
which is too hard on those little muscles.

35. Fast˗food chains are tempting children towards their 
products by sending direct mail to children under 12 years 
of age and offering them free meals for their birthdays. 
The marketing campaigns targeting pre˗teens by fast˗food 
restaurants have been revealed thanks to a report in the 
government’s inquiry into privacy laws. Civil organizations 
have asked the federal government to ban direct mail 
marketing to children without the consent of their parents. 
The report says that children’s susceptibility to commercial 
influence means that the use of their personal information 
for direct marketing unfairly manipulates them, and is likely 
to harm them in other ways. It also adds that such 
promotional activities could influence children to have 
unhealthy diets.                        * susceptibility: 취약성
① side effects of selling personal information
② relationship between commercials and sales
③ concerns about fast˗food chains’ marketing toward kids
④ importance of developing healthy foods for children 
⑤ efforts of fast˗food restaurants for children’s health
36. Wat Xieng Thong에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Wat Xieng Thong is regarded not only as the most 
beautiful monastery in Luang Prabang, but one of the most 
delicate in all of Laos. The name Wat Xieng Thong means 
Temple of the Golden City. This temple is located close to 
the tip of the Luang Prabang peninsula, where the Nam Khan 
flows into the Mekong River. It was built by King 
Setthathirath in 1560, during the golden years of the Lan 
Xang Kingdom. Its gracefully sloping roof and glass paintings 
on the walls represent the classical Luang Prabang style of 
temple architecture. It had been supported by the kings right 
up to 1975, when the monarchy ended. It was here that the 
kings were crowned and granted their power.

37. Ben Schneider에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Ben Schneider was the son of an anthropology professor and 
a sociology professor. To the surprise of his bookish parents, 
his favorite childhood possession was a workbench. Thanks in 
part to that, he developed an early passion for carpentry and 
an ability to do impressive things with wood. During his 20s, 
when he worked as an actor, Mr. Schneider could make ends 
meet by making furniture and doing carpentry. In 2002, he 
bought a very old house that was ready to collapse for 
$435,000. With his own hands, he reassembled, repaired, and 
restored the tumbledown house to create a spacious dwelling.

38. Trekking has been recently trendy. With more people 
becoming attracted to the activity, the demand for trails with 
convenient facilities is increasing. To benefit from this 
boom, provincial governments are jumping on the trail 
development bandwagon to the point of raising concerns of 
overheating. Experts raise several issues that stem from this 
sudden fever. More than anything else, analysts cite the 
environmental damage that too many human visitors can 
cause. The environmental health of several trails has been 
severely damaged ― visitors often leave trash and pick 
flowers or plants. Local governments have also paved some 
of the courses with cement.
* jump on the bandwagon: (시대 흐름에) 편승하다

39. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston 
used magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scans to measure the 
amygdalas of 58 people aged 19 to 83. As part of the 
study, each of the volunteers completed a questionnaire 
asking them the number of people they met on a regular 
basis. They also commented on the complexity of each 
relationship. The researchers found that participants with 
larger amygdalas typically had more people in their social 
lives and maintained more complex relationships. Those with 
the smallest amygdalas listed fewer than 15 people as 
regular contacts, while those with the largest amygdalas 
counted up to 50 acquaintances in their social circles.

40. During every fall football season in the U. S., most parents 
and coaches focus on the safety of the players. But there’s 
growing evidence that they should turn their attention to the 
sidelines: cheerleading. It is commonly regarded as a feast 
to the eye or a wonderful performance. However, the 
Washington Post offers a report on the many risks 
associated with cheerleading, which has emerged as one of 
the riskiest of women’s sports, leaving a long trail of 
sprained wrists, twisted ankles, and damaged knees. Much 
worse than that, it is also reported that cheerleading 
accounted for two˗thirds of all catastrophic incidents such as 
death, head injury, or permanent disability among female 
high school and college athletes.

41. From the moment you touch down in Japan, if you do not 
speak Japanese, you will be faced with a world that is 
difficult to decode. Turn on a TV in a Tokyo hotel room, 
and you will get a lot of incomprehensible symbols. What 
can be done in this situation? Science fiction has always 
solved the problem of language with clever devices which 
act as universal translators. But in reality, it has been a lot 
trickier. Because of different fonts, written text can be very 
difficult to translate. There is already a reading aid on the 
web ― Google Translate. The problem is that, so far, it is 
quite literal with its translations and lacks the nuance of 
someone who speaks the language.

② Use of Translators in Science Fiction
③ Dangers Caused by Miscommunication
④ Helpful Translators: Friends of Tourists

The graph above shows past and projected rates of obese 
and overweight children aged 3 to 17 in Korea. ① All 
categories except for the rate of girls’ obesity were at their 
peak in 2000 and are expected to decrease steadily through 
2020. ② During the entire period, the rate of overweight 
boys is the highest of all, while that of obese girls is the 
lowest. ③ The gap between overweight boys and overweight

Babies are immersed in the language that they are 
expected to learn. They hear family members conversing, 
conversations in the grocery store, and people talking to 
them. 
(A) For example, when Janie says “goo, goo,” her mother 
rushes over with a cookie and says, “Oh, here’s a cookie.” 
When Jake shouts, “I want what ball,” his father says, 
“Here’s that ball,” as he throws it to his son.
(B) Through exposure to various situations such as these, 
they speak something that is similar to something else, but 
not exactly the same. 
(C) In this way, parents accept and often celebrate their 
children’s approximations, considering them natural and 
essential behaviors of language acquisition.

But don’t build your igloo yet. 
In ages past, the Earth passed through a series of ice ages, 
in which much of the Northern Hemisphere was covered with 
glaciers. ( ① ) The mild temperatures we’re familiar with
occur between ice ages. ( ② ) It is thought that very slight 
changes in the position of the Earth relative to the sun are 
behind these shifts in climate. ( ③ ) Scientists say that we 
can expect colder temperatures as the planet moves toward
another ice age. ( ④ ) Not only is the next ice age still 
thousands of years away, it’s possible that it might not arrive 
at all. ( ⑤ ) Global warming, caused by an increase in 
carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, may 
prevent the next ice age from occurring.

People living in the suburbs of London during World War 
II experienced an increase of stomach ulcers in response to 
the stress of being bombed by German warplanes. And yet 
Londoners, who were bombed more often, didn’t experience 
stomach ulcers that much. The explanation of this paradox 
requires an understanding of the power of uncertainty. 
People living in Central London were overwhelmed by 
nightly bombing raids, whereas those living in the suburbs 
were raided only irregularly. Objectively speaking, it is 
worse to be bombed often in the night than to be bombed 
less often. But in reality, irregular bombing feels worse 
because people become so unsure about when they will be 
exposed to the next bombing raid.

A district mayor in the Japanese capital, Tokyo, is going 
on an unusual leave for the birth of his newborn baby on 
Saturday. He will be the first local government leader ever 
to do so. Hironobu Narisawa, the mayor of the central 
Bunkyo district, said he was aiming to change attitudes. 
Japanese workers are famously reluctant to take time off 
after the birth of a child even though Japanese law allows 
either parent to have up to a year off. Mr. Narisawa’s 
announcement has been front page news in Japan these days.  
No other local government leader, male or female, has 
taken time off after the birth of a child. Nationwide, just 
one in 100 fathers takes any paternity leave. None of the 
male employees of Bunkyo district has done so. Mr. 
Narisawa, whose son was born in February, said he hoped 
his              would help to change attitudes. However, 
Mr. Narisawa will not be entirely switching off from work 
during his two˗week leave. He is planning to remain in the 
district in case of emergencies.

(A) Frank was on his way to the Aspen Music School. He 
had heard wonderful stories about it and he was especially 
excited to be studying with Mr. Stessin, an esteemed 
professor from the Juilliard School. After a few lessons 
with (a) him, Frank knew that he would not be 
disappointed. The professor noticed every turn of each 
musical phrase, and added his sense of humor to every 
lesson. 
(B) Only days later, Mr. Stessin was back in his studio, 
teaching! Initially shocked by his decision to stay, Frank 
soon began to understand (b) him. He and his wife had 
been teaching at the Aspen Music School for many years 
and had built a strong sense of community with the 
faculty and students. Furthermore, Frank realized (c) he 
found comfort through his love of music and students. 
Leaving Aspen would have meant leaving behind his 
fondest memories of Nancy.
(C) As Frank was preparing Beethoven’s Sonata for a 
master class, Mr. Stessin jokingly warned him, “Don’t play 
this too well, Frank, or I’ll have nothing to say!” The 
master class went quite well, considering that it was his 
first performance of the sonata. A few days later, Frank 
met Mr. Stessin’s wife, Nancy who was also on the Aspen 
faculty. She said to (d) him, “That was a very nice 
Beethoven you played the other day.” He was touched by 
her thoughtful comment.
(D) One day, as Frank was sitting down with his friends 
to have lunch, someone whispered to him, “Mrs. Stessin 
passed out!” He naturally assumed that she had fainted 
from the heart or something. That night, he could not 
sleep knowing that she was dead. He wondered how Mr. 
Stessin could possibly cope with the terrible tragedy. 
Surely (e) he would be heading back to New York as soon 
as arrangements could be made.
