40. During every fall football season in the U. S., most parents 
and coaches focus on the safety of the players. But there’s 
growing evidence that they should turn their attention to the 
sidelines: cheerleading. It is commonly regarded as a feast 
to the eye or a wonderful performance. However, the 
Washington Post offers a report on the many risks 
associated with cheerleading, which has emerged as one of 
the riskiest of women’s sports, leaving a long trail of 
sprained wrists, twisted ankles, and damaged knees. Much 
worse than that, it is also reported that cheerleading 
accounted for two˗thirds of all catastrophic incidents such as 
death, head injury, or permanent disability among female 
high school and college athletes.
