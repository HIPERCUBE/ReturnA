27. Each insurance plan is different when it comes to what’s 
covered and what’s not. Figuring out which one is right for 
you is a bit of a balancing act: You want to get the most 
benefits at the least cost. Start by looking at all the 
elements of the plan and not just the price tag. For 
example, a plan with a low monthly premium isn’t 
necessarily the cheapest. Your hospital bill might be very 
high or you might pay much more for your prescriptions 
depending on your insurance. So if you see a doctor often 
or take prescription medications regularly, a more expensive 
plan that covers a higher percentage of the cost may 
actually                             .
