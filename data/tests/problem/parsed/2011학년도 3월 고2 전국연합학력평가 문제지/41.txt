41. From the moment you touch down in Japan, if you do not 
speak Japanese, you will be faced with a world that is 
difficult to decode. Turn on a TV in a Tokyo hotel room, 
and you will get a lot of incomprehensible symbols. What 
can be done in this situation? Science fiction has always 
solved the problem of language with clever devices which 
act as universal translators. But in reality, it has been a lot 
trickier. Because of different fonts, written text can be very 
difficult to translate. There is already a reading aid on the 
web ― Google Translate. The problem is that, so far, it is 
quite literal with its translations and lacks the nuance of 
someone who speaks the language.
