But don’t build your igloo yet. 
In ages past, the Earth passed through a series of ice ages, 
in which much of the Northern Hemisphere was covered with 
glaciers. ( ① ) The mild temperatures we’re familiar with
occur between ice ages. ( ② ) It is thought that very slight 
changes in the position of the Earth relative to the sun are 
behind these shifts in climate. ( ③ ) Scientists say that we 
can expect colder temperatures as the planet moves toward
another ice age. ( ④ ) Not only is the next ice age still 
thousands of years away, it’s possible that it might not arrive 
at all. ( ⑤ ) Global warming, caused by an increase in 
carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, may 
prevent the next ice age from occurring.
