Then, the clever mother tore out a page of a magazine,
which contained a picture of the world. Tearing it into pieces,

then she would read her a story. A short time later, the

whole world came together.”

Because all weather is ① interconnected, a change in one
area affects other areas. Today, scientists collect information
worldwide so that they can understand and predict changes
in the weather more ② accurately. Due to technological
advances in the last several decades, scientists can now
gather detailed information on cloud cover, precipitation,
temperature changes, wind speed and direction, and
energy from both the sun and earth. The collection of
data ③ reveals some interesting facts. For example, winds
in one region are accompanied by ④ similar winds in
another; therefore, if north winds are extremely cold in one
part of the world, south winds are abnormally warm in
another part. Since winds affect precipitation, changes in wind
patterns ⑤ influence the amount of rainfall.

26. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Who am I? This may sound like a question found on
a freshman philosophy exam, but Socrates was serious
when he told his students, “Know yourself.” You would
be foolish to buy a cow if you lived in an apartment.
You would be equally foolish to invest in real estate if
you needed constant access to your money. The first
place an investor should look, then, is in the mirror. Do
you see wrinkles? Maybe you are heading toward
retirement and therefore need investments that provide
you with a steady income. Do you see a young parent,
who needs a lot of money for her daughter’s education?
Then you could accept high risk investment for a high
return.

27. Modern-day men tend to spend a lot of time and money
on their . Today, global sales of male grooming
products bring in billions of dollars a year, and the industry
is not expected to slow down. However, modern man’s
interest in grooming and cosmetic products is not a new
phenomenon. Men in Egypt had their own makeup boxes that
comprised special jars of colored makeup which they applied
to their eyes, lips, cheeks, and nails. Greek men also applied
flower-based oils to their skin. The eye creams, facial masks,
and moisturizers that men are buying today are simply
different versions of the same idea, one that began 12,000
years ago.
① appearance ② homes ③ relationships
④ healthcare ⑤ hobbies
28. What makes you yawn? Researchers from a North
American university discovered the reason of yawning: to
. During the experiment, they
provided half of volunteers with a cold pack to hold to their
forehead. None of them yawned, unlike the other half given a
warm pack. This study proved that the temperature of the
brain falls through breathing as it delivers cool blood to the
brain. Additional cooling has the same effect, so people do
not feel the need to yawn. In fact, our brain heats up as it
burns as much as a third of all the calories we consume. In
order to function more efficiently, the brain needs to be cool.
Thus when people yawn, they instinctively increase blood
flow, bringing in low temperature air. [3점]
① speed up our calorie burn
② remove waste from our blood
③ protect our brain from overheating
④ react to a boring and dull situation
⑤ increase our resistance to cold weather
29. Why do some people choose to know the truth about their
health, and others refuse? People who ___________________
are more likely to agree to know about their health. To test
this idea, researchers set up a scenario that mimicked an
annual checkup. In this checkup, they told participants about
a serious but fictional disease, and then asked whether the
participants would like to be tested for it. Prior to the
checkup, some participants were made to feel good about
themselves while others were not. The subjects who had
their self-esteem raised were more likely to want to be
tested for it. Physicians say that early treatment is critical
for many diseases, so helping people face potentially
frightening information with a positive self-esteem increases
their chances of survival. [3점]
① consider themselves a valuable person
② have had serious health problems
③ keep their emotions stable
④ are educated in health or medicine
⑤ watch movies about serious diseases
30. Races have first, second, and third prizes. This practice is
the result of . In the early
seventeenth century in Chester, England, the sheriff agreed to
provide a silver trophy for the winner of a horse race and
contracted with a silversmith to do the work. The
silversmith’s first trophy was unacceptable, and he was sent
back for another try. The second one, too, was inadequate,
and he was instructed to try a third time. The third trophy
was fine, but now the sheriff had three trophies instead of
one. In order not to be wasteful, the sheriff decided to award
trophies to the first, second, and third place winners. [3점]
* sheriff: (잉글랜드․웨일즈에서) 주 장관
① a racer’s violation of the game rules
② a sheriff’s intention to win a horse race
③ the excessive competition in sports events
④ efforts to reduce the cost of making trophies
⑤ a silversmith’s inability to satisfy his customer
31. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
“Art does not solve problems, but makes us aware of their
existence,” a sculptor once said. Arts education, on the other
hand, does solve problems. Years of research show that it is
closely linked to almost everything that we say we want for
our children. Involvement in the arts is associated with gains
in math, reading, critical thinking, and verbal skills. Learning
the arts can also improve motivation, concentration,
confidence, and teamwork. A report about the visual arts
argues that the pleasures and stimulation of the art
experience do more than sweeten an individual’s life.
According to the report, they “can connect people more
deeply to the world and open them to new ways of seeing,”
creating the foundation to build up social bonds.
① the value of social interactions
② the advantages of arts education
③ ways to promote critical thinking
④ the characteristics of successful artists
⑤ the significance of intelligence in problem-solving

Shopping is no longer just a necessity, a way to get the
things we must have to survive. (A) , shopping
has become a leisure activity. We shop just for the fun of it.
We also live in an age of consumerism, and we are
encouraged to define ourselves and obtain others’ approval by
acquiring possessions. Fortunately, most people still manage
to live within their means. However, the growing consumer
debt indicates that more and more people may be letting their
spending habits get out of hand. (B) , as much
as 8 to 10 percent of the American adult population may be
compulsive shoppers. Compulsive shopping is a serious
disorder that can ruin lives if it’s not recognized and treated.

The bar graph above shows the total number of hybrid
car sales by year for three regions: U.S.A., Asia and
Europe. ① In 2007, hybrid car sales in these three regions
were the strongest in the U.S.A. and the weakest in Europe.
②However, the following year, hybrid car sales decreased
slightly in the U.S.A. and increased slightly in the other
regions. ③Despite this, the sales rank of hybrid cars in these
three regions remained the same for both years. ④ In 2009,
hybrid cars suddenly increased in popularity in Asia,
surpassing the U.S.A. in sales for the first time. ⑤The
following year, hybrid car sales continued to increase in Asia,
but decreased in both the U.S.A. and Europe.

Native people create legends to explain unusual events in
their environment. A legend from the Hawaiian island of
Kauai explains ① how the naupaka flower got its unusual
shape. The flower looks like half a small daisy. The legend
says that the marriage of two young lovers on the island
②was opposed by both sets of parents. The parents found
the couple together on a beach one day, and ③ to prevent
them from being together, one of the families moved to the
mountains, separating the young couple forever. As a result,
the naupaka flower was separated into two halves; one half
moved to the mountains, and the other half ④ staying
near the beach. This story is a good example of a legend
⑤ which native people invented to make sense of the world
around them.
35. Matthew Henson에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Matthew Henson was born into a poor African-American
family in Maryland in 1866. After his father died, he went to
Washington, D.C. at the age of eleven. After working in a
cafe for a while, he became a sailor. In 1887, Matthew was
hired to be a servant to Robert Peary. When Peary planned a
trip to Greenland, Matthew volunteered to go along. Matthew
was able to communicate with the Inuit, the native people of
the North. They taught him ways to survive in the arctic
such as building snow houses and training sled dogs. On
their third attempt on April 6, 1909, Matthew and Peary
finally became the first men to reach the North Pole. In 1947,
a biography of Henson called “Dark Companion” was published.
① 11세에 Washington D.C.로 갔다.
② Greenland에 갈 것을 자원했다.
③ Peary로부터 썰매개 훈련 방법을 배웠다.
④ 세 번의 시도 끝에 북극에 도달했다.
⑤ 1947년에 그의 전기가 출판되었다.
36. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
See if you can think of something really thoughtful to do
for someone, and enjoy it for its own sake. It can be mowing
your neighbor’s lawn, or coming home early from work to
give your spouse a break from the kids. When you complete
your favor, see if you can feel the warmth of knowing you
have done something for someone without expecting anything.
If you practice, I think you will discover that the feelings
themselves are reward enough. What interferes with this
peaceful feeling is our expectation of receiving something in
return. The solution is to notice these thoughts and gently
dismiss them. In the absence of these thoughts, your positive
feelings will return.
① 남을 돕는 일에도 계획이 필요하다.
② 보상과 벌을 적절하게 활용해야 한다.
③ 하기 싫은 일부터 먼저 처리해야 한다.
④ 대가를 기대하지 말고 선행을 베풀어야 한다.
⑤ 타인에 대한 과도한 배려가 피해를 줄 수도 있다.

Every so often, a heartwarming news story tells of a
shipwrecked sailor who was on the verge of drowning in a
stormy sea. Suddenly, a dolphin popped up at his side and
pushed the sailor safely to shore. It is tempting to conclude
that dolphins must really like human beings, enough to save
us from drowning. But wait ―Are they actually intending to
be helpful? To answer that question, we should know the
opposite cases of shipwrecked sailors who have been pushed
further out to sea by dolphins and never come back again.
We don’t know about those cases because the sailors don’t
live to tell us about their evil-dolphin experiences.

Clark’s nutcrackers in North America survive by their
remarkable memory. When food is abundant, a nutcracker
hides nuts throughout the forest as a reserve for harder
times. ① It hides at least 30,000 nuts in up to 5,000 small
places each year. ② It is able to remember the location of
about 75 percent of its hiding places. ③The bird uses its
powerful bill to twist open cones of pine trees and remove
the nuts. ④The interesting question is whether the
remaining 25 percent is actually forgotten or whether it is
deliberately not collected. ⑤ Interestingly, the birds seem
to hide 25 percent more nuts than they normally need.

Since early Roman times some grain has been
associated with the wedding ceremony. Wheat, a
symbol of fertility, was carried in the bride’s hand or
worn around her neck.
(A) During the reign of Queen Elizabeth Ⅰ, wheat was no
longer tossed at brides but was instead baked into small
cakes that were then crumbled and tossed over the
bride’s head.
(B) As the bride left the church, grains of wheat were tossed
at her, and young girls rushed to pick up the grains that
had actually touched the bride.
(C) This change in ceremony left the wedding guests feeling
deprived, since they had nothing to toss at the bride. Since
at that time rice was cheap, clean, and white, it seemed a
good substitute for the more expensive wheat cakes.

At first no one believed that the clock’s bell could
have been heard from so far away.
The expression, “saved by the bell,” did not come
from the world of boxing, where a downed fighter can
be saved by the bell. It originated, instead, in the
seventeenth century. ( ① ) A guard at Windsor Castle
was accused of being asleep on duty. ( ② ) He denied
the charge and kept pleading innocent. ( ③ ) He offered
as proof of his innocence the fact that he had heard the
bell in the clock tower of St. Paul’s Cathedral strike
thirteen times at midnight. ( ④ ) However, it was
discovered that the clock had, in fact, struck thirteen
times at midnight on the very night he was supposed to
have fallen asleep on duty. ( ⑤ ) The guard was, of
course, released, having been “saved by the bell.”

his friends participated in the diving contest at the
community pool. Divers from all over the city came to
participate in the contest.
(B)
They waited for the winner to be announced. All the
divers were shocked when the small boy’s name was
announced. The judge threw up his hands and said,
“(b) His dive may not have been the cleanest, but it
was the riskiest by far. I gave points for his courage
and for trying.” Jonathan walked away shaking his
head, determined to do it differently next year.
(C)
All the divers got ready to start their routines.
Jonathan performed (c) his dive and did well enough to
move on to the final round, where the diver could
select the dive of his or her choice. Thoughts of the
final dive came into Jonathan’s mind. All the divers
gathered around discussing who was left to compete.
(D)

swimsuit. (d) He laughed with his peers about how this

dive without much style. Jonathan was next. (e) He

[44∼45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Dr. Robert Provine, who wrote an article on
laughter, believes humans laugh primarily because it
serves as a kind of “social glue” that keeps people
connected to one another. We laugh with others
because it makes us feel a bond with them and that
bond in turn gives us a sense of trust and comfort.
No matter how hard we try, we are unable to make
ourselves laugh. Consequently, when we laugh, others
can be certain that it is an honest reaction, and
honesty is key when building and maintaining
friendships.
Since laughter is seen as a social cue that we send
to others, it can also help explain why it spreads to
others. Studies have proven that when people see or
hear something funny, they are 30 times more likely
to laugh when they are with others than when they
are alone. Wanting to be accepted by others is part of
human nature. Nobody wants to feel left out, and
is a way to signal to
others that you feel the way they do, which makes us
feel more bonded to one another. The brain realized
this a long time ago, and group laughter has occurred
ever since.
