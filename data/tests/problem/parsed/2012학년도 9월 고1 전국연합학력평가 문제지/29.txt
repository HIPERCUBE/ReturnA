health, and others refuse? People who ___________________
are more likely to agree to know about their health. To test
this idea, researchers set up a scenario that mimicked an
annual checkup. In this checkup, they told participants about
a serious but fictional disease, and then asked whether the
participants would like to be tested for it. Prior to the
checkup, some participants were made to feel good about
themselves while others were not. The subjects who had
their self-esteem raised were more likely to want to be
tested for it. Physicians say that early treatment is critical
for many diseases, so helping people face potentially
frightening information with a positive self-esteem increases
their chances of survival. [3점]
