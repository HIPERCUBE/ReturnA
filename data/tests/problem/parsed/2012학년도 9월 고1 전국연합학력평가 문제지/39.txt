Since early Roman times some grain has been
associated with the wedding ceremony. Wheat, a
symbol of fertility, was carried in the bride’s hand or
worn around her neck.
(A) During the reign of Queen Elizabeth Ⅰ, wheat was no
longer tossed at brides but was instead baked into small
cakes that were then crumbled and tossed over the
bride’s head.
(B) As the bride left the church, grains of wheat were tossed
at her, and young girls rushed to pick up the grains that
had actually touched the bride.
(C) This change in ceremony left the wedding guests feeling
deprived, since they had nothing to toss at the bride. Since
at that time rice was cheap, clean, and white, it seemed a
good substitute for the more expensive wheat cakes.
