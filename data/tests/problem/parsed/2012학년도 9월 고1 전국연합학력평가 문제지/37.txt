Every so often, a heartwarming news story tells of a
shipwrecked sailor who was on the verge of drowning in a
stormy sea. Suddenly, a dolphin popped up at his side and
pushed the sailor safely to shore. It is tempting to conclude
that dolphins must really like human beings, enough to save
us from drowning. But wait ―Are they actually intending to
be helpful? To answer that question, we should know the
opposite cases of shipwrecked sailors who have been pushed
further out to sea by dolphins and never come back again.
We don’t know about those cases because the sailors don’t
live to tell us about their evil-dolphin experiences.
