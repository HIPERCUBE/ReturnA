Dr. Robert Provine, who wrote an article on
laughter, believes humans laugh primarily because it
serves as a kind of “social glue” that keeps people
connected to one another. We laugh with others
because it makes us feel a bond with them and that
bond in turn gives us a sense of trust and comfort.
No matter how hard we try, we are unable to make
ourselves laugh. Consequently, when we laugh, others
can be certain that it is an honest reaction, and
honesty is key when building and maintaining
friendships.
Since laughter is seen as a social cue that we send
to others, it can also help explain why it spreads to
others. Studies have proven that when people see or
hear something funny, they are 30 times more likely
to laugh when they are with others than when they
are alone. Wanting to be accepted by others is part of
human nature. Nobody wants to feel left out, and
is a way to signal to
others that you feel the way they do, which makes us
feel more bonded to one another. The brain realized
this a long time ago, and group laughter has occurred
ever since.
