At first no one believed that the clock’s bell could
have been heard from so far away.
The expression, “saved by the bell,” did not come
from the world of boxing, where a downed fighter can
be saved by the bell. It originated, instead, in the
seventeenth century. ( ① ) A guard at Windsor Castle
was accused of being asleep on duty. ( ② ) He denied
the charge and kept pleading innocent. ( ③ ) He offered
as proof of his innocence the fact that he had heard the
bell in the clock tower of St. Paul’s Cathedral strike
thirteen times at midnight. ( ④ ) However, it was
discovered that the clock had, in fact, struck thirteen
times at midnight on the very night he was supposed to
have fallen asleep on duty. ( ⑤ ) The guard was, of
course, released, having been “saved by the bell.”
