See if you can think of something really thoughtful to do
for someone, and enjoy it for its own sake. It can be mowing
your neighbor’s lawn, or coming home early from work to
give your spouse a break from the kids. When you complete
your favor, see if you can feel the warmth of knowing you
have done something for someone without expecting anything.
If you practice, I think you will discover that the feelings
themselves are reward enough. What interferes with this
peaceful feeling is our expectation of receiving something in
return. The solution is to notice these thoughts and gently
dismiss them. In the absence of these thoughts, your positive
feelings will return.
