Matthew Henson was born into a poor African-American
family in Maryland in 1866. After his father died, he went to
Washington, D.C. at the age of eleven. After working in a
cafe for a while, he became a sailor. In 1887, Matthew was
hired to be a servant to Robert Peary. When Peary planned a
trip to Greenland, Matthew volunteered to go along. Matthew
was able to communicate with the Inuit, the native people of
the North. They taught him ways to survive in the arctic
such as building snow houses and training sled dogs. On
their third attempt on April 6, 1909, Matthew and Peary
finally became the first men to reach the North Pole. In 1947,
a biography of Henson called “Dark Companion” was published.
