28. What makes you yawn? Researchers from a North
American university discovered the reason of yawning: to
. During the experiment, they
provided half of volunteers with a cold pack to hold to their
forehead. None of them yawned, unlike the other half given a
warm pack. This study proved that the temperature of the
brain falls through breathing as it delivers cool blood to the
brain. Additional cooling has the same effect, so people do
not feel the need to yawn. In fact, our brain heats up as it
burns as much as a third of all the calories we consume. In
order to function more efficiently, the brain needs to be cool.
Thus when people yawn, they instinctively increase blood
flow, bringing in low temperature air. [3점]
① speed up our calorie burn
② remove waste from our blood
③ protect our brain from overheating
④ react to a boring and dull situation
⑤ increase our resistance to cold weather
