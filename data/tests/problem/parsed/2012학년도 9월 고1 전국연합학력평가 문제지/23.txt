My wife and I visited your cinema last month. We
purchased two tickets which came to a total of $44. At the
time of purchase, the attendant at the information desk told
us they were having some problems accepting credit card
payments. At that time, I was anxious about my credit card
payment, but the attendant told me that there was no
problem with my payment. However, when I received my
bank statement, I discovered that you charged my card twice.
I would be grateful if you could resolve this matter quickly.
