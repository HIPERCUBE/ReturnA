26. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Who am I? This may sound like a question found on
a freshman philosophy exam, but Socrates was serious
when he told his students, “Know yourself.” You would
be foolish to buy a cow if you lived in an apartment.
You would be equally foolish to invest in real estate if
you needed constant access to your money. The first
place an investor should look, then, is in the mirror. Do
you see wrinkles? Maybe you are heading toward
retirement and therefore need investments that provide
you with a steady income. Do you see a young parent,
who needs a lot of money for her daughter’s education?
Then you could accept high risk investment for a high
return.
