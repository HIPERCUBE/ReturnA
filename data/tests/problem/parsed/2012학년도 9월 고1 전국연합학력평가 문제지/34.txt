Native people create legends to explain unusual events in
their environment. A legend from the Hawaiian island of
Kauai explains ① how the naupaka flower got its unusual
shape. The flower looks like half a small daisy. The legend
says that the marriage of two young lovers on the island
②was opposed by both sets of parents. The parents found
the couple together on a beach one day, and ③ to prevent
them from being together, one of the families moved to the
mountains, separating the young couple forever. As a result,
the naupaka flower was separated into two halves; one half
moved to the mountains, and the other half ④ staying
near the beach. This story is a good example of a legend
⑤ which native people invented to make sense of the world
around them.
