Clark’s nutcrackers in North America survive by their
remarkable memory. When food is abundant, a nutcracker
hides nuts throughout the forest as a reserve for harder
times. ① It hides at least 30,000 nuts in up to 5,000 small
places each year. ② It is able to remember the location of
about 75 percent of its hiding places. ③The bird uses its
powerful bill to twist open cones of pine trees and remove
the nuts. ④The interesting question is whether the
remaining 25 percent is actually forgotten or whether it is
deliberately not collected. ⑤ Interestingly, the birds seem
to hide 25 percent more nuts than they normally need.
