We often use the excuse that it is natural to be frustrated 
when our plans change. That depends, however, on what your 
priorities are. Is it more important to stick to some rigid work 
schedule or to be available to my four­year­old? The more 
general question is, “What’s more important ― getting what I 
want and keeping my plans, or learning to go with the flow?” 
Clearly, to become a more peaceful person, you must prioritize 
flexibility over rigidity most of the time. I have also found it 
helpful to expect that a certain percentage of plans will change. 
If you make allowances in your mind for this inevitability,   
then when it happens you can say, “Here is one of those 
inevitabilities.”
① 가족 간의 화합에 우선순위를 두어라.
