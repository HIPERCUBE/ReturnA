Many years ago I crossed the heart of the Sahara Desert in 
Algeria. ① By that time, it was 500 miles across in a single 
stretch without water, food, grass or even a fly. ② More than 
1,300 people had died in the crossing of that stretch of the 
Sahara in previous years. ③ Often drifting sands had wiped out 
the track across the desert and the travelers had gotten lost 
in the night. ④ Because of our carelessness, deserts were 
spreading over regions where there had been once green, 
fertile land. ⑤ To solve this problem, the French had marked 
the track with black oil drums and that was helpful for 
travelers to cross the desert.
