This was a historically important method of producing images 
on paper, both in artistic printmaking, and also for commercial 
reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has 
long been replaced by photography in its commercial applications 
and is much less common in printmaking. This is the practice of 
carving a design into a hard, usually flat surface, by cutting deep 
lines into it. A hardened steel tool called a burin is used to cut 
the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.
