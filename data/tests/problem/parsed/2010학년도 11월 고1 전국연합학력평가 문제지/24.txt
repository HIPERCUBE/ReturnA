24.  Planning a trip to an unfamiliar place is like running a 
whitewater rapid. Watch the rapid carefully, evaluate alternative 
routes, then organize your course. As you begin your run 
through the rapid, you will know what to expect and will be in 
the right state of mind. After that, just enjoy the exciting ride. 
If, on the other hand, you enter a rapid without a good plan, 
you may get a chilly surprise. In the same way, planning a trip 
to a foreign destination can initially seem puzzling. However, 
arranging things in advance will enable you to avoid costly, 
frustrating, and possibly dangerous mistakes. In other words,     
determines success.
