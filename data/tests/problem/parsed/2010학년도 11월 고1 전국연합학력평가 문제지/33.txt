33.  Newspaper circulation has been falling for years. In the 
1960s, four out of five Americans read a paper every day, 
but now only half of Americans do so. The Washington Post’s 
circulation is down 3 percent from 2005, and the Los Angeles 
Times’s circulation is down more than 6 percent. Desperation 
has produced a new kind of scandal. Some newspapers 
cheated in circulation figures. They were found to have 
nearly 100,000 ghost readers. Now, newspapers that were 
once published in the traditional broadsheet size are forced to 
switch to a tabloid layout.
