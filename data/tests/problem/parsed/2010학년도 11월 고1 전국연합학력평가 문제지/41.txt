41.  ‘Buycotting’ is the opposite of boycotting. It is a positive 
activist tool that gives consumers power to make the most 
socially­responsible business practices. Whereas a boycott is a 
punishment of a company for negative behavior, a buycott is a 
praise to a company for good behavior and an incentive to promote 
change. A buycott works on the consumers’ understanding that 
corporations have profit as their top priority. Also, buycotts make 
corporations realize that the most profitable choice is to fulfill 
their responsibilities to society.
