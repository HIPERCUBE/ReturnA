As a boy, Robert Lopatin had imagined himself as a doctor. 
However, when Robert was in school, his father asked him to 
join him in a new clothing business (a) he was starting. For 
almost three decades, Robert dedicated himself to the business. 
But when his father sold the business to a competitor, the 
newly unemployed Robert knew exactly what (b) he wanted to 
do with his time. It was going back to school.  
At age fifty­one Robert began studying at the Albert Einstein 
College of Medicine in New York City. (c) He was older than 
most of his professors. He was even older than the school itself. 
But (d) he felt completely at ease. “I hesitated a lot, but once I 
undertook it, it just felt so right,” (e) he said. “Even though 
you’re old, once you do make a commitment to something, 
there’s more purposefulness and there’s more joy.” Dr. Lopatin 
now practices in New York.
