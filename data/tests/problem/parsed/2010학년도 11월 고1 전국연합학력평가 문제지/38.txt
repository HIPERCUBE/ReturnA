organize land, capital, and labor so that the most efficient 
combination of these resources will be used. There should not 
be too much of one resource and too little of another. A farmer, 
for example, recognizes that a given amount of land must be

are not in correct proportion, the unit cost of output will be 
higher than it should be. As a result, the business will not 
realize the maximum profit possible.
