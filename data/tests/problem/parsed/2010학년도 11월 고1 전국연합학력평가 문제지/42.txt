pressurize to 70,000 psi, and discharge through a tiny hole. You’ll 
get a needle­sharp jet that looks innocent but is one of the 
newest and most effective cutting tools for some very 
hard­to­cut materials. Engineers in a water jet company ran 
plasterboard, chipboard and rubber under this amazingly powerful

saws, knives, and similar tools; but the water jet brings big 
advantages. The water jet was cheaper and better.
