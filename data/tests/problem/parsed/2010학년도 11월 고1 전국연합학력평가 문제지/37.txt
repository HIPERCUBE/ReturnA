There was an innovative plane in the early twentieth 
century. A small Russian biplane, which originally had been 
designed as a two­seater, was remodeled into this innovative 
plane. It, as an emergency transport, was capable of carrying 
sixteen passengers. Eight men slid into small cabins 
constructed on the underside of each lower wing. The 
experimental craft was developed as an aid to the military 
experiment of flying parachute­equipped troops behind enemy 
lines and also as a possible means of transporting goods 
economically. In a test flight, the unique transport was said to 
have reached a speed of 180 miles an hour.
