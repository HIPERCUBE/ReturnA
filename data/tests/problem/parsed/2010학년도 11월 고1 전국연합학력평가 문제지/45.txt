Embryos of the red­eyed tree frog turn over to get a breath 
of fresh air. Most of the oxygen is near the eggs’ exposed 
surface. To get at the oxygen, these four­ and five­day­old
embryos position their heads and external gills near the 
air­exposed surface for minutes at a time; conversely, if the 
embryos’ gills end up in a low­oxygen region in the eggs, the 
embryos will reposition themselves within 15 seconds on 
average. The embryos are capable of this behavior so early in 
their development — they show the behavior as soon as one 
day old.
