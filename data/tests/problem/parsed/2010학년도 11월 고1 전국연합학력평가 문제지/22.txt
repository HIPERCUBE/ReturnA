If you were a baseball fan ①during the early 1960s, you 
probably remember a baseball player named Maury Wills. From 
1960 to 1966, Wills was a record­making base stealer. In 1965, a 
year ②when he stole more bases than any other player in the 
major leagues, he also held the record for the greatest number of 
times being caught stealing. However, if Wills had allowed himself 
③to become frustrated by his outs, he would have never set any 
records. Thomas Edison said, “I’m not ④ discouraged because 
every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.” Even 
though it is five thousand experiments that do not work, the 
milestones on the road to success ⑤is always the failures.
