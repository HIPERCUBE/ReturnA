39.  When people work closely together, there are bound to be 
misunderstandings and communication problems among them. 
Too much in­person contact might just be annoying, especially 
if a coworker has a habit we don’t like. It is to be expected that 
people may become impatient with one another if they see each 
other frequently. Or they may take each other for granted and 
not make enough effort at communicating properly. Keeping a 
proper sense of distance between people is important. Indeed, 
we are likely to get more hurt from being too familiar than 
from complete ignorance of the other party. 
① Practice makes perfect.
② Time flies like an arrow.
③ Honesty is the best policy.
④ Familiarity breeds contempt.
⑤ Two heads are better than one.
