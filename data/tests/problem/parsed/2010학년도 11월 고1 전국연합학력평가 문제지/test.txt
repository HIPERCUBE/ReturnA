This was a historically important method of producing images 
on paper, both in artistic printmaking, and also for commercial 
reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has 
long been replaced by photography in its commercial applications 
and is much less common in printmaking. This is the practice of 
carving a design into a hard, usually flat surface, by cutting deep 
lines into it. A hardened steel tool called a burin is used to cut 
the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.

Encouraged by this, Cindy said that ② she was about to close a 
very important business deal and asked her a favor. ③ She 
wanted Jessica to say a quick “Hello, Cindy!” while she met with 
her client. Jessica agreed to do that. Ten minutes later when 
Cindy was speaking with her client, ④ she approached and said, 
“Hi, Cindy, what’s going on?” To this ⑤ she arrogantly replied, 
“Not now, can’t you see I’m in a meeting?”

Remember that every sport can be dangerous. Mountain biking 
is not an exception. You can break your equipment, and you can 
hurt yourself. Ride within your abilities, and always wear the 
proper protective gear for the type of riding you’re doing. 
Always wear a helmet and gloves. If you are in any place you 
expect you might crash, consider elbow and knee pads and a 
full­face helmet. We also suggest eye protection. However, the 
best technique and gear will not prevent all crashes or injuries. 
If you go out and hurt yourself, it’s your own fault. Be patient, 
take it one step at a time, and have fun!

If you were a baseball fan ①during the early 1960s, you 
probably remember a baseball player named Maury Wills. From 
1960 to 1966, Wills was a record­making base stealer. In 1965, a 
year ②when he stole more bases than any other player in the 
major leagues, he also held the record for the greatest number of 
times being caught stealing. However, if Wills had allowed himself 
③to become frustrated by his outs, he would have never set any 
records. Thomas Edison said, “I’m not ④ discouraged because 
every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.” Even 
though it is five thousand experiments that do not work, the 
milestones on the road to success ⑤is always the failures.
23.  다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Many years ago I crossed the heart of the Sahara Desert in 
Algeria. ① By that time, it was 500 miles across in a single 
stretch without water, food, grass or even a fly. ② More than 
1,300 people had died in the crossing of that stretch of the 
Sahara in previous years. ③ Often drifting sands had wiped out 
the track across the desert and the travelers had gotten lost 
in the night. ④ Because of our carelessness, deserts were 
spreading over regions where there had been once green, 
fertile land. ⑤ To solve this problem, the French had marked 
the track with black oil drums and that was helpful for 
travelers to cross the desert.

24.  Planning a trip to an unfamiliar place is like running a 
whitewater rapid. Watch the rapid carefully, evaluate alternative 
routes, then organize your course. As you begin your run 
through the rapid, you will know what to expect and will be in 
the right state of mind. After that, just enjoy the exciting ride. 
If, on the other hand, you enter a rapid without a good plan, 
you may get a chilly surprise. In the same way, planning a trip 
to a foreign destination can initially seem puzzling. However, 
arranging things in advance will enable you to avoid costly, 
frustrating, and possibly dangerous mistakes. In other words,     
determines success.
*rapid: 급류
① health ② weather
③ preparation ④ cooperation
⑤ productivity
25.  Anger can                                      . The next time you 
hear someone arguing in a raised voice, try to imagine what is 
happening in his body. Blood pressure builds up. A weak heart 
can be stressed to a dangerous point. Headaches often follow 
the buildup of rage. The whole internal system is stressed, 
ready for an emergency, and the whole digestive process is 
shut off or slowed down. Stomachaches, indigestion, and all 
sorts of trouble with digestive organs can arise from chronic 
anger. You can turn red, sweat, tremble, and be very 
uncomfortable ― all because you are angry.
① worsen your memory
② increase your appetite
③ cause you to take action
④ make you physically sick
⑤ disturb positive judgment 
26.  Windows of hanok reflect the traditional view that forms 
should be created by                                   . The size and the 
placement of windows in hanok are determined by the senses, 
not by mathematical calculation. It is like building things with 
the eye, not with measuring instruments. There is no standard 
size or position for windows. They are installed where it feels 
right. This is a natural approach to creation and is based on the 
aesthetics of feelings. This characteristic of windows of hanok 
shows an example of the abstract beauty in traditional Korean 
architecture.
① relying on feelings
② coping with climates
③ showing fixed images 
④ satisfying requirements
⑤ designing accurate systems
27.  When you were growing up, your mother probably told you 
to sit up straight because good posture helps you have more 
confidence and see yourself more positively. It turns out that 
sitting up straight can                                      , according to 
a study in the October 2009 issue of the European Journal of 
Social Psychology. Researchers asked college students to rate 
themselves on how good they would be as job candidates and 
employees. Those told to sit up straight while filling out the 
rating form gave themselves higher ratings than those 
instructed to have poor posture while doing the same thing. 
Once again, Mom was right. [3점]

② prevent you from being stressed
③ lead you to focus on your learning
④ improve how you feel about yourself
⑤ have an influence on your relationships
28.  Over the past decade, the ecologist John Terborgh of Duke 
University has observed directly how the loss of large animals  
. When a hydroelectric 
dam flooded thousands of acres in Venezuela, Terborgh saw 
the water create dozens of islands. They were too small to 
support the creatures at the top of the food chain such as 
jaguars, pumas, and eagles. The disappearance of these animals 
sparked a chain of reactions. Animals, such as monkeys and 
leafcutter ants, thrived and subsequently destroyed vegetation. 
Finally, the ecosystems collapsed. 

① encourages land reform
② affects the natural world 
③ leads to the evolution of animals
④ results in the arrival of new species 
⑤ weakens the domestic tourism industry
29.  다음 글에 드러난 ‘He’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
He suddenly found himself lost in a series of monitor control 
screens as he tried to get back to the main screen. Most 
systems had a single button or a single command to return to 
the previous screen or the main menu. But this system did not. 
After a while, he got the main screen back. He wasn’t sure 
what he had done, but it was back. He paused, looking for a 
command. Then, he pushed so many different commands. It 
was no good. He was bothered and couldn’t stay calm. For 
some reason, he was getting consistent error messages. He 
couldn’t understand what they meant. He shook his head in 
irritation. 
① pleased and happy ② sad and regretful 
③ proud and satisfied ④ relieved and peaceful
⑤ annoyed and frustrated

것은?
What is the difference between recreational diving equipment 
and cave diving equipment? The greatest difference is the 
snorkel. Recreational divers use a snorkel ① linked to a mask 
so that they can breathe with it in shallow water. On the other 
hand, the cave divers use the mask without a snorkel. The 
second big difference is fin blades. Recreational divers use     
② split fin blades. On the contrary, cave diving fins tend to be 
③ simple, yet powerful. Another significant area of difference 
is that of exposure protection. The diving suit for cave divers 
is usually ④ shorter than recreational divers’. One more 
difference is the use of weights. While recreational divers wear 
weights on their ⑤ waist, cave divers do not use them. 
36.  Igbo에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The Igbo occupy densely settled farming areas in southeastern 
Nigeria. They form Nigeria’s third­largest ethnic group with 
around 25 million Igbos. Their history is not happy, though. 
Many Igbos fell victim to slavery as their territory was close to 
the gulf of Guinea. The Igbo have a reputation for hard work, 
ambition and a love of education. Traditional­minded Igbos will 
not eat the new season’s yam until Ikeji, the annual new yam 
festival. Although they are mostly Christian, many Igbos still 
practice the traditional religion of Odinani. They speak their own 
language, Igbo, and the majority of them speak English, too. 
① Nigeria 인구 중 차지하는 비율이 가장 높다. 
② 노예제도로 인한 피해를 입지 않았다.
③ 근면함과 교육에 대한 열의로 유명하다.
④ Ikeji라는 축제를 2년에 한 번씩 연다. 
⑤ 영어 사용자가 소수에 불과하다.
37.  an innovative plane에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
There was an innovative plane in the early twentieth 
century. A small Russian biplane, which originally had been 
designed as a two­seater, was remodeled into this innovative 
plane. It, as an emergency transport, was capable of carrying 
sixteen passengers. Eight men slid into small cabins 
constructed on the underside of each lower wing. The 
experimental craft was developed as an aid to the military 
experiment of flying parachute­equipped troops behind enemy 
lines and also as a possible means of transporting goods 
economically. In a test flight, the unique transport was said to 
have reached a speed of 180 miles an hour. 
① 2인용 항공기를 개조한 것이다.
② 16명의 승객을 태울 수 있다.
③ 아래 날개의 밑 부분에 객실이 있다.
④ 민간 여객 수송용으로 개발되었다.
⑤ 시험 비행에서 시속 180마일의 속도를 기록했다.

38.  In providing a supply of goods, the enterprise’s job is to 
organize land, capital, and labor so that the most efficient 
combination of these resources will be used. There should not 
be too much of one resource and too little of another. A farmer, 
for example, recognizes that a given amount of land must be 
worked by a certain amount of labor and a specific number of 
machines. In this case, if the resources engaged in production 
are not in correct proportion, the unit cost of output will be 
higher than it should be. As a result, the business will not 
realize the maximum profit possible.
① 생산성 향상을 위해서 노사가 화합해야 한다.
② 제조업자는 원자재의 특성을 정확히 알아야 한다.
③ 생산자는 최적화된 비율로 자원을 투입해야 한다.
④ 사회의 각 구성원은 자신의 임무에 충실해야 한다.
⑤ 기업은 제품에 대한 윤리적 책임의식을 지녀야 한다.
39.  When people work closely together, there are bound to be 
misunderstandings and communication problems among them. 
Too much in­person contact might just be annoying, especially 
if a coworker has a habit we don’t like. It is to be expected that 
people may become impatient with one another if they see each 
other frequently. Or they may take each other for granted and 
not make enough effort at communicating properly. Keeping a 
proper sense of distance between people is important. Indeed, 
we are likely to get more hurt from being too familiar than 
from complete ignorance of the other party. 
① Practice makes perfect.
② Time flies like an arrow.
③ Honesty is the best policy.
④ Familiarity breeds contempt.
⑤ Two heads are better than one.
40.  글의 흐름으로 보아, 주어진 문장이 들어가기에 가장 적절한 곳은?
In addition, it was on its way to democratic development.
In the early 1990s, I happened to come across economic data on 
one country and South Korea in the early 1960s, and I was 
astonished to see how similar their economies were then. ( ①  ) 
These two countries had roughly comparable levels of per capita 
GNP. ( ② ) Thirty years later, South Korea had become an 
industrial giant with the fourteenth largest economy in the world. 
(  ③ ) No such economic and political changes had occurred in 
the other country, whose per capita GNP was about one­fifteenth 
of that of South Korea’s in the 1990s. ( ④ ) How could this 
extraordinary difference in development be explained? ( ⑤ ) 
Undoubtedly, many factors played a role, but it seemed to me that 
culture had to be a large part of the explanation.

41.  ‘Buycotting’ is the opposite of boycotting. It is a positive 
activist tool that gives consumers power to make the most 
socially­responsible business practices. Whereas a boycott is a 
punishment of a company for negative behavior, a buycott is a 
praise to a company for good behavior and an incentive to promote 
change. A buycott works on the consumers’ understanding that 
corporations have profit as their top priority. Also, buycotts make 
corporations realize that the most profitable choice is to fulfill 
their responsibilities to society. 
① Boycott: Always Bad?
② No More Academic Failures!
③ Still Spending? Start to Save!
④ Balance between Import and Export
⑤ Buycott: Positive Reward from Consumers
42.  Take ordinary tap water, mix in a tiny bit of additive, 
pressurize to 70,000 psi, and discharge through a tiny hole. You’ll 
get a needle­sharp jet that looks innocent but is one of the 
newest and most effective cutting tools for some very 
hard­to­cut materials. Engineers in a water jet company ran 
plasterboard, chipboard and rubber under this amazingly powerful 
jet. It cut through them all and left a narrow razor­sharp cut with 
no dust, fragments, or chips. You can do the same work with 
saws, knives, and similar tools; but the water jet brings big 
advantages. The water jet was cheaper and better.
*psi: pounds per square inch(압력의 단위)

② Do You Drink Enough Water at Work?
③ Recycling Waste Materials with Water

Thirty years ago most psychologists and philosophers thought 

that babies and young children were irrational and egocentric. 
(A) However, in the past three decades, scientists have 
discovered that even the youngest children know more than 
we would ever have thought possible. 
(B) Furthermore, studies suggest that children learn about the 
world in much the same way that scientists do. They 
conduct experiments, analyze statistics, and form theories.
(C) They believed children were unable to understand cause 
and effect, imagine the experiences of other people, or 
appreciate the difference between reality and fantasy.

44.  다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
We often use the excuse that it is natural to be frustrated 
when our plans change. That depends, however, on what your 
priorities are. Is it more important to stick to some rigid work 
schedule or to be available to my four­year­old? The more 
general question is, “What’s more important ― getting what I 
want and keeping my plans, or learning to go with the flow?” 
Clearly, to become a more peaceful person, you must prioritize 
flexibility over rigidity most of the time. I have also found it 
helpful to expect that a certain percentage of plans will change. 
If you make allowances in your mind for this inevitability,   
then when it happens you can say, “Here is one of those 
inevitabilities.”
① 가족 간의 화합에 우선순위를 두어라.
② 삶의 불가피한 변화에 유연하게 대처하라.

Embryos of the red­eyed tree frog turn over to get a breath 
of fresh air. Most of the oxygen is near the eggs’ exposed 
surface. To get at the oxygen, these four­ and five­day­old
embryos position their heads and external gills near the 
air­exposed surface for minutes at a time; conversely, if the 
embryos’ gills end up in a low­oxygen region in the eggs, the 
embryos will reposition themselves within 15 seconds on 
average. The embryos are capable of this behavior so early in 
their development — they show the behavior as soon as one 
day old.

(A)
I was very, very shy when I was young. I had a couple of 
experiences as a kid standing up in front of groups and literally 
not being able to speak, with my voice just disappearing. I 
couldn’t eat for days before giving a speech. I was terrified. So 
it is ironic that as an adult I find myself traveling from state to 
state lecturing several times a month throughout the year.
(B)
Now, twenty years later, it is something I do in my career that 
I truly enjoy. Roosevelt once said, “Most of the work that’s
done gets done by people who weren’t feeling all that well at 
the time that they did it.” It sums up my life. My initial reaction 
is to be afraid of things. But, in the end, I realize that I can do 
things if I try and persevere.
(C)
I was panicked when I learned this and would have given 
anything to get out of it. Week one, I was still nervous when 
facing the students. But I didn’t give up. The second week, I 
could handle it with a little less stress. And by the third week, I 
could finally speak comfortably in front of a large group. 
(D)
With patience, I tried to develop a talent for speaking publicly. 
When I was in graduate school, I was poor and secured a 
teaching assistantship to help pay my tuition. The only problem 
was that I had to speak in front of a whole classroom full of 
students.

As a boy, Robert Lopatin had imagined himself as a doctor. 
However, when Robert was in school, his father asked him to 
join him in a new clothing business (a) he was starting. For 
almost three decades, Robert dedicated himself to the business. 
But when his father sold the business to a competitor, the 
newly unemployed Robert knew exactly what (b) he wanted to 
do with his time. It was going back to school.  
At age fifty­one Robert began studying at the Albert Einstein 
College of Medicine in New York City. (c) He was older than 
most of his professors. He was even older than the school itself. 
But (d) he felt completely at ease. “I hesitated a lot, but once I 
undertook it, it just felt so right,” (e) he said. “Even though 
you’re old, once you do make a commitment to something, 
there’s more purposefulness and there’s more joy.” Dr. Lopatin 
now practices in New York.
