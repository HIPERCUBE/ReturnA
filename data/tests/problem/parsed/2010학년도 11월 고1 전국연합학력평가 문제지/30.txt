What is the difference between recreational diving equipment 
and cave diving equipment? The greatest difference is the 
snorkel. Recreational divers use a snorkel ① linked to a mask 
so that they can breathe with it in shallow water. On the other 
hand, the cave divers use the mask without a snorkel. The 
second big difference is fin blades. Recreational divers use     
② split fin blades. On the contrary, cave diving fins tend to be 
③ simple, yet powerful. Another significant area of difference 
is that of exposure protection. The diving suit for cave divers 
is usually ④ shorter than recreational divers’. One more 
difference is the use of weights. While recreational divers wear 
weights on their ⑤ waist, cave divers do not use them.
