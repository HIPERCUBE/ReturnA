In this view, people aren’t cold theorizers who are making 
judgments about other creatures. 
Philosophers have long argued about the process people use to 
understand one another. Some believe that we are careful 
theorizers. ( ① ) We come up with hypotheses about how other 
people will behave, and then test those hypotheses against the 
evidence we observe minute by minute. ( ② ) In this theory, 
people come across as rational scientists, constantly weighing 
evidence and testing explanations. ( ③ ) And there’s clear 
evidence that this sort of hypothesis testing is part of how we 
understand one another. ( ④ ) But these days most of the 
research supports the idea that we automatically simulate 
others, and understand what others feel by feeling what they 
are experiencing, in ourselves. ( ⑤ ) They are unconscious 
actors who understand by sharing or at least simulating the 
responses they see in the people around them. [3점]
