31. In order to succeed, a work of art must                          , 
but this requirement is not about the nature of art so much as 
about the nature of the human perceptive apparatus. Without 
sufficient size, no object can be perceived as having parts that 
can be arranged in a pattern, or a perceptible structure. A lion 
or a shark, therefore, can be beautiful, because their parts form 
a meaningful, well-structured whole. A flea, however, cannot 
be beautiful, not because it is a trifling or disagreeable animal, 
but because it is too minute for the unaided eye to perceive 
parts that are arranged meaningfully. A speck cannot possibly 
by itself be beautiful; beauty is only possible where an object 
has visible parts. [3점]
