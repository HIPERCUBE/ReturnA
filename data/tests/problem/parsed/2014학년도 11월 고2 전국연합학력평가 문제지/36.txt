36. On the surface, some products are easier to sell online 
than others. For instance, anything that can be delivered in a 
digital format is likely to do well online and we have already 
seen the decline of traditional record shops and photo 
processors. ① However, there are many products which 
benefit from being touched or experienced in some way before 
being purchased. ② Thus a customer may wish to test-drive a 
new car before buying it or feel the weight of a piece of furniture 
to assess its solidity. ③ Michael de Kare-Silver suggests that a 
product’s propensity to online selling depends to a certain 
degree on which of the five senses it appeals to. ④ Although not 
all the risks of online shopping can be eliminated, a great deal of 
them can be avoided by choices the customer makes. ⑤Thus, 
products which are sold on the basis of sight or sound alone can 
be sold online relatively easily, whereas those appealing to 
the senses of touch, taste, or smell cannot. [3점]
