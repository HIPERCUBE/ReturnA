The Icelandic horse is a breed of horse developed in Iceland. 
Although the horse is small, at times pony-sized, it’s a sturdy 
animal perfectly suited to the rough Icelandic terrain. The first 
horses were introduced by the early settlers and, since no 
other horses have been imported recently, the breeding stock 
remains pure. From the first years of settlement in Iceland to 
the early part of this century, these horses were the primary 
form of transportation in the country. Horsefights were 
organized as a source of entertainment and the meat was 
consumed as a staple. Even today the horse is still used for 
traditional farm work, as well as for leisure activities.
