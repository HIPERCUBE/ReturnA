When you are in the supermarket, do you buy something from 
each and every aisle? Of course not. You go to aisles that have 
something you want and skip the aisles that don’t have anything 
you need. But when it comes to watching television, many of us 
seem to follow the buy-something-from-every-aisle plan. 
Too often we watch TV because that’s what we usually do 
rather than because there is something we actually want to see. 
Ask yourself when you are watching TV, “Is this something I 
want to see?” Don’t turn on the TV just because it’s there and 
that’s what you usually do.
