35. One of the easiest ways to be likeable and win others over 
is to offer a sincere compliment. Developing awareness of 
others will help you notice things about them to compliment.
① The key is to put your own self-centered thoughts aside 
and become genuinely interested in other people. ② When 
you give people a genuine, sincere compliment about a 
trait or accomplishment, you’ve given them a valuable 
gift. ③ However, too expensive a gift can cause a person to 
feel uncomfortable. ④You make them feel valued, acknowledged, 
and important. ⑤ When people feel this way, their self-esteem 
goes up, they like themselves more, and because of this, they 
find you likeable.
