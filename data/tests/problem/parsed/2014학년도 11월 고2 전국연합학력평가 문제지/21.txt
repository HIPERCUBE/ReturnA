Paper is not only useful for preserving information. In its role 
as a wrapping material, paper also does a good job of hiding it. 
What would birthdays be like without this material, which 
performs the role of building excitement and anticipation better 
than all others? I have received presents wrapped in cloth, or 
hidden in a cupboard, but nothing has the magic of wrapping 
paper. A present really isn’t a present unless it is wrapped in a 
paper. It is the paper that, by concealing and revealing an 
object, ritualizes the act of giving and receiving, turning that 
object into a gift. This is not just a cultural association. The 
material has fundamental properties that make it ideal for this 
role.
