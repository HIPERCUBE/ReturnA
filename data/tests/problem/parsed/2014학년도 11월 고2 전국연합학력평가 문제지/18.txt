Dear Sir:
We are writing to you in reference to your e-mail 
dated October 20, 2014. Regarding your request, we 
have checked your order and found that the order form 
was signed on September 21, 2014. According to the 
contractual conditions of your advertisement order, the 
applicant can withdraw the order within seven days 
from the signing of the order form. Yet, having studied 
your case, it seems that your cancellation request was 
sent to us after the authorized cancellation period. 
What this means is that it is not possible to cancel your 
order now. We hope you understand our position. 
Yours faithfully,  
John Mark
on behalf of X&Y ADVERTISING
