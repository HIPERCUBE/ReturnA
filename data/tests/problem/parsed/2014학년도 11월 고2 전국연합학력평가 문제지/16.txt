When you are in the supermarket, do you buy something from 
each and every aisle? Of course not. You go to aisles that have 
something you want and skip the aisles that don’t have anything 
you need. But when it comes to watching television, many of us 
seem to follow the buy-something-from-every-aisle plan. 
Too often we watch TV because that’s what we usually do 
rather than because there is something we actually want to see. 
Ask yourself when you are watching TV, “Is this something I 
want to see?” Don’t turn on the TV just because it’s there and 
that’s what you usually do.

④ 교양 TV 프로그램 편성을 확대하라.
⑤ TV 광고에 현혹되지 않도록 주의하라.

A symbol differs from an imitative representation. It stands 
for something else but does not attempt to accurately duplicate 
it. A connection between a symbol and its referent is not 
necessarily causal as is a visual representation of, for example, 
a living room on television. The heart-shaped symbol ‘♥’ 
stands for the word ‘love’ in our culture, but the connection 
between the symbol and its meaning had to be learned. In a 
culture where the heart-shaped symbol has no known meaning, 
it is unlikely to get a response, or it may get a different 
response. In other words, a symbol is understood only because 
there are shared conventional meanings.

Paper is not only useful for preserving information. In its role 
as a wrapping material, paper also does a good job of hiding it. 
What would birthdays be like without this material, which 
performs the role of building excitement and anticipation better 
than all others? I have received presents wrapped in cloth, or 
hidden in a cupboard, but nothing has the magic of wrapping 
paper. A present really isn’t a present unless it is wrapped in a 
paper. It is the paper that, by concealing and revealing an 
object, ritualizes the act of giving and receiving, turning that 
object into a gift. This is not just a cultural association. The 
material has fundamental properties that make it ideal for this 
role.
① Conflicting Views on Wrapping
② Various Useful Materials for Wrapping
③ Wrapping: An Old Custom We Should End
④ Paper: What Makes an Object a Present
⑤ How Can We Choose Proper Wrapping Paper?

There is an important difference between having an ideal and 
making a rule to live by. The ideal may be a perfect and 
flawless standard that one would be proud to attain. Such an 
ideal provides you with a guide, but it should not be a daily 
standard. Making the ideal into a rule is digging oneself a trap. 
If you constantly fall into the trap, you feel so bad about 
yourself that it becomes increasingly hard to keep going. The 
rule needs to be clear, and to direct you toward the ideal if that 
is what you want, but it also needs to be realistic, if it is not to 
undermine your self-esteem. That is why it makes more sense 
to do the best you can ― rather than aim for perfection.
① difficulties of setting realistic goals
② why rules to live by need to be realistic
③ common characteristics of perfectionists
④ how self-esteem affects our relationships
⑤ negative effects of detailed goals on our lives
