Patrick’s neighbor had played the part of Santa Claus for 
several years, creating a tradition of a visit from Santa to all 
the children in the neighborhood. But one year, Santa had a cold 
and asked whether Patrick could take over for ① him that day. 
Instead of the neighbor, ② he wore the suit and passed out 
candy canes to all the neighborhood children, convincing them 
he was for real. “When I put on the suit, I actually felt like 
Santa Claus,” Patrick says. When the old Santa saw how much 
Patrick enjoyed the job, he told Patrick he would be happy to 
let ③ him take over. Patrick has been playing Santa for so long 
now that ④ he is beginning to see the children of the children 
he saw as Santa when he first started out. But Patrick has no 
plans to find a new man for the suit. “Santa never retires,” ⑤ he 
says.
