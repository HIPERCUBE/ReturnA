Psychologists have noted a strong difference that separates 
Western from Chinese thought: the way each culture explains 
social events. Suppose, (A) , that you see a person 
driving carelessly through a red traffic light. Westerners are 
more likely to criticize the person, assuming he generally cares 
little for the safety of others. In contrast, East Asians including 
Chinese are more likely to believe that the driver has been 
forced to drive fast because he’s in the midst of an emergency. 
Perhaps he’s transporting someone to the hospital, or perhaps 
he’s going to school to pick up a sick child. (B) , the 
person is behaving badly because he’s responding to the 
situation, and not because he’s irresponsible. 
(A) (B)
① for example …… In addition
② for example …… In other words
③ however …… Nevertheless
④ however …… As a result
⑤ instead …… Likewise
