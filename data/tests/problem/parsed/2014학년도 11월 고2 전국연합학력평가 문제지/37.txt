Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer, is driven by the 
idea that almost everything is noise. He believes very few 
things are essential. His job is to filter through that noise 
until he gets to the essence.  
(A) It took courage, as it always does, to eliminate the 
non-essential. By the sixties this aesthetic started to 
become more and more popular. In time it became the 
design every other record player followed.
(B) For example, when he was the lead designer at a company, 
he was asked to collaborate on a record player. The norm 
at the time was to cover the turntable in a solid wooden lid 
or even to incorporate the player into a piece of living 
room furniture. 
(C) Instead, he and his team removed the clutter and designed 
a player with a clear plastic cover on the top and nothing 
more. It was the first time such a design had been used, 
and it was so revolutionary that people worried it might 
bankrupt the company because nobody would buy it.
