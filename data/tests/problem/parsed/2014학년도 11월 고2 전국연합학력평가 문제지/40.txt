More than 40 years ago, psychologist Sibylle Escalona 
carried out what has become a classic study of the play 
behaviors of 128 infants and their mothers. Her major finding 
was that, even if the infants had a large variety of toys to 
play with, the sensorimotor play of babies playing alone was 
less sustained than that of babies who had an adult to interact 
with. The mothers seemed to be skilled social directors. 
They tended to adapt the play activities to the immediate 
needs of children by varying their own activities in response 
to what the children were doing. For example, mothers would 
vary the rate at which they offered new play materials and 
introduce variations or increase the intensity of play when the 
children seemed to be losing interest. As a result, the 
mothers were able to sustain their children’s interest in the 
various play activities and thereby increase the length of their 
attention spans.
