Debating is as old as language itself and has taken many 
forms throughout human history. In ancient Rome, debate in the 
Senate ① was critical to the conduct of civil society and the 
justice system. In Greece, advocates for policy changes would 
② routinely make their cases before citizen juries composed of 
hundreds of Athenians. In India, debate was used to ③ settle 
religious controversies and was a very popular form of 
entertainment. Indian kings sponsored great debating contests, 
④ offering prizes for the winners. China has its own ancient 
and distinguished tradition of debate. Beginning in the 2nd 
Century A.D., Taoist and Confucian scholars engaged in a 
practice known as ‘pure talk’ ⑤ which they debated spiritual 
and philosophical issues before audiences in contests that might 
last for a day and a night.
