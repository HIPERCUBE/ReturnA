Metals are fundamentally different from these other 
materials because they can be hammered into shape.
During the Stone Age, our ancestor’s tools were made of flint, 
wood, and bone. ( ① ) Anyone who has ever tried to make 
anything with these kinds of tools knows how limiting they are: 
if you hit a piece of wood it either cracks or snaps. ( ② ) Not 
only that, they get stronger when you hit them; you can harden 
a blade just by hammering it. ( ③ ) And you can reverse the 
process simply by putting metal in a fire and heating it up, 
which will cause it to get softer. ( ④ ) The first people to 
discover these properties ten thousand years ago had found a 
material that was almost as hard as rock but behaved like a 
plastic and was almost infinitely reusable. ( ⑤ ) In other 
words, they had discovered the perfect material for tools, and 
in particular cutting tools like axes and razors.
