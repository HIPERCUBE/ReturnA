(A)
Jason was ten years old and loved baseball, but he suffered 
from physical disabilities. His father, Bob, wanted to protect 
(a) him, and so he played catch with him in their back yard 
and avoided any community games. One day Bob got home 
from work and asked Jason if he wanted to play catch, but 
Jason hung his head and said no. 
(B)
When Jason finally hit the ball after seven swings, it didn’t go 
far, but the kids who knew Jason started yelling, “Run, Jason! 
Run!” Their voices were soon joined by those of all the 
players, on both teams. Everyone was cheering and Jason’s 
face glowed when (b) he finally scored. He shouted, “I did it 
Daddy! I did it!” Tears slid down Bob’s cheeks as he hugged 
his joyful son. 
(C)
At the coach’s suggestion, Jason was very excited, and 
(c) he hurried to put on his baseball gear. Most of the kids 
on the town team recognized Jason from school, but no one 
from the other team knew him. However, they could see 
that (d) he was different by the way he moved as he ran 
onto the field to hit the ball for his team. To make it easier 
for Jason, the pitcher moved in closer, threw the ball 
gently, and kept throwing until he could hit one. 
(D)
Bob wondered why Jason said no, and when (e) he asked, 
Jason started to cry: “I want to play on a team, Daddy. Why 
won’t you let me play with the other kids?” Although Bob was 
worried that Jason might be teased or mocked by the other 
kids, he decided to take the risk, and so he brought Jason to 
the town baseball field that evening. When they arrived at the 
field, it turned out that a baseball game was about to start. 
Bob talked to the coach about Jason, and the coach invited 
Jason to play.
