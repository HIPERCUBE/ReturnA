34. 다음 글의 마지막에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Yesterday I got up early because I wanted to clean my room 
before school. I began to organize my desk, but then I heard a 
knocking sound from the front door. It was too early in the 
morning for someone to be there. I wondered who it could be. 
Since my parents were still asleep, they didn’t answer the door. 
So I headed downstairs to investigate. At the door I asked, 
“Who is it?” The person replied, “It’s me! Open up.” It was a 
voice I knew very well. “Grandma! I can’t believe you’re here!” 
I screamed as I flung open the door. It was such an unexpected 
delight to see her standing there. I welcomed her with plenty of 
hugs and kisses.
