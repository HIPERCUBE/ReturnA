There is an important difference between having an ideal and 
making a rule to live by. The ideal may be a perfect and 
flawless standard that one would be proud to attain. Such an 
ideal provides you with a guide, but it should not be a daily 
standard. Making the ideal into a rule is digging oneself a trap. 
If you constantly fall into the trap, you feel so bad about 
yourself that it becomes increasingly hard to keep going. The 
rule needs to be clear, and to direct you toward the ideal if that 
is what you want, but it also needs to be realistic, if it is not to 
undermine your self-esteem. That is why it makes more sense 
to do the best you can ― rather than aim for perfection.
