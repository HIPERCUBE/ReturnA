32. Consciousness is one of the most profound puzzles of 
existence, and it is a cutting-edge topic of investigation among 
scientists. How is it that mere physical processes in the brain 
give rise to the subjective, conscious experience? One of the 
promising hypotheses for how consciousness arises comes 
from John Searle. He claims that as an emergent property, the 
processes and elements within the brain cause consciousness, 
but it is                                                    . For example, 
consider a cup of coffee. The liquidity of the coffee is explained 
by the behavior of the molecules that compose it, but none of 
the individual molecules are liquid. Consciousness, like the 
liquidity of brewed coffee, is a property that emerges from the 
behavior of many individual elements that cannot be reduced or 
explained by any single element in the system. [3Ï†ê]
