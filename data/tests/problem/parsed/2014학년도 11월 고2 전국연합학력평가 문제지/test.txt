When you are in the supermarket, do you buy something from 
each and every aisle? Of course not. You go to aisles that have 
something you want and skip the aisles that don’t have anything 
you need. But when it comes to watching television, many of us 
seem to follow the buy-something-from-every-aisle plan. 
Too often we watch TV because that’s what we usually do 
rather than because there is something we actually want to see. 
Ask yourself when you are watching TV, “Is this something I 
want to see?” Don’t turn on the TV just because it’s there and 
that’s what you usually do.

20. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
A symbol differs from an imitative representation. It stands 
for something else but does not attempt to accurately duplicate 
it. A connection between a symbol and its referent is not 
necessarily causal as is a visual representation of, for example, 
a living room on television. The heart-shaped symbol ‘♥’ 
stands for the word ‘love’ in our culture, but the connection 
between the symbol and its meaning had to be learned. In a 
culture where the heart-shaped symbol has no known meaning, 
it is unlikely to get a response, or it may get a different 
response. In other words, a symbol is understood only because 
there are shared conventional meanings.
* referent: 지시 대상
① 상징 기호는 학습 도구로 사용될 수 있다.  
② 상징 기호의 의미는 사회적으로 공유된 것이다.
③ 상징 기호의 복잡성은 문화적 선진성의 지표이다. 
④ 상징 기호는 지시 대상의 물리적 특징을 반영한다.
⑤ 상징 기호는 모든 문화에 걸쳐 보편적으로 이해된다.
21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Paper is not only useful for preserving information. In its role 
as a wrapping material, paper also does a good job of hiding it. 
What would birthdays be like without this material, which 
performs the role of building excitement and anticipation better 
than all others? I have received presents wrapped in cloth, or 
hidden in a cupboard, but nothing has the magic of wrapping 
paper. A present really isn’t a present unless it is wrapped in a 
paper. It is the paper that, by concealing and revealing an 
object, ritualizes the act of giving and receiving, turning that 
object into a gift. This is not just a cultural association. The 
material has fundamental properties that make it ideal for this 
role.
① Conflicting Views on Wrapping
② Various Useful Materials for Wrapping
③ Wrapping: An Old Custom We Should End
④ Paper: What Makes an Object a Present
⑤ How Can We Choose Proper Wrapping Paper?
22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? 
There is an important difference between having an ideal and 
making a rule to live by. The ideal may be a perfect and 
flawless standard that one would be proud to attain. Such an 
ideal provides you with a guide, but it should not be a daily 
standard. Making the ideal into a rule is digging oneself a trap. 
If you constantly fall into the trap, you feel so bad about 
yourself that it becomes increasingly hard to keep going. The 
rule needs to be clear, and to direct you toward the ideal if that 
is what you want, but it also needs to be realistic, if it is not to 
undermine your self-esteem. That is why it makes more sense 
to do the best you can ― rather than aim for perfection.
① difficulties of setting realistic goals
② why rules to live by need to be realistic
③ common characteristics of perfectionists
④ how self-esteem affects our relationships
⑤ negative effects of detailed goals on our lives

The graph above compares the percentage of the U.S. 
population with the percentage of newspaper readership among 
four different age groups. ① Among the four age groups, the 
18-24 group accounts for the lowest percentage of both 
population and newspaper readership. ② Compared to the 
45-64 age group, the 25-44 age group is 1% more of the 
population but 16% less of the newspaper readership. ③ The 
age group that represents the largest percentage in both 
population and newspaper readership is the 65-plus group. 
④ The percentage gap in newspaper readership between the 
youngest group and the oldest one is 32%. ⑤ The two youngest 
groups have greater population than newspaper readership 
percentage while the two oldest groups have greater newspaper 
readership than population percentage.

26. Icelandic horse에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The Icelandic horse is a breed of horse developed in Iceland. 
Although the horse is small, at times pony-sized, it’s a sturdy 
animal perfectly suited to the rough Icelandic terrain. The first 
horses were introduced by the early settlers and, since no 
other horses have been imported recently, the breeding stock 
remains pure. From the first years of settlement in Iceland to 
the early part of this century, these horses were the primary 
form of transportation in the country. Horsefights were 
organized as a source of entertainment and the meat was 
consumed as a staple. Even today the horse is still used for 
traditional farm work, as well as for leisure activities.

27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Debating is as old as language itself and has taken many 
forms throughout human history. In ancient Rome, debate in the 
Senate ① was critical to the conduct of civil society and the 
justice system. In Greece, advocates for policy changes would 
② routinely make their cases before citizen juries composed of 
hundreds of Athenians. In India, debate was used to ③ settle 
religious controversies and was a very popular form of 
entertainment. Indian kings sponsored great debating contests, 
④ offering prizes for the winners. China has its own ancient 
and distinguished tradition of debate. Beginning in the 2nd 
Century A.D., Taoist and Confucian scholars engaged in a 
practice known as ‘pure talk’ ⑤ which they debated spiritual 
and philosophical issues before audiences in contests that might 
last for a day and a night.
32. Consciousness is one of the most profound puzzles of 
existence, and it is a cutting-edge topic of investigation among 
scientists. How is it that mere physical processes in the brain 
give rise to the subjective, conscious experience? One of the 
promising hypotheses for how consciousness arises comes 
from John Searle. He claims that as an emergent property, the 
processes and elements within the brain cause consciousness, 
but it is                                                    . For example, 
consider a cup of coffee. The liquidity of the coffee is explained 
by the behavior of the molecules that compose it, but none of 
the individual molecules are liquid. Consciousness, like the 
liquidity of brewed coffee, is a property that emerges from the 
behavior of many individual elements that cannot be reduced or 
explained by any single element in the system. [3점]

① a simple sum of individual elements 
② not a state of endless mental activities 
③ not a property of any individual elements
④ a process of reducing the size of a single element
⑤ not understood through complex mental processes

Psychologists have noted a strong difference that separates 
Western from Chinese thought: the way each culture explains 
social events. Suppose, (A) , that you see a person 
driving carelessly through a red traffic light. Westerners are 
more likely to criticize the person, assuming he generally cares 
little for the safety of others. In contrast, East Asians including 
Chinese are more likely to believe that the driver has been 
forced to drive fast because he’s in the midst of an emergency. 
Perhaps he’s transporting someone to the hospital, or perhaps 
he’s going to school to pick up a sick child. (B) , the 
person is behaving badly because he’s responding to the 
situation, and not because he’s irresponsible. 
(A) (B)
① for example …… In addition
② for example …… In other words
③ however …… Nevertheless
④ however …… As a result
⑤ instead …… Likewise
34. 다음 글의 마지막에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Yesterday I got up early because I wanted to clean my room 
before school. I began to organize my desk, but then I heard a 
knocking sound from the front door. It was too early in the 
morning for someone to be there. I wondered who it could be. 
Since my parents were still asleep, they didn’t answer the door. 
So I headed downstairs to investigate. At the door I asked, 
“Who is it?” The person replied, “It’s me! Open up.” It was a 
voice I knew very well. “Grandma! I can’t believe you’re here!” 
I screamed as I flung open the door. It was such an unexpected 
delight to see her standing there. I welcomed her with plenty of 
hugs and kisses.
① sad and depressed ② relieved and proud
③ scared and frightened ④ surprised and pleased
⑤ ashamed and embarrassed

35. One of the easiest ways to be likeable and win others over 
is to offer a sincere compliment. Developing awareness of 
others will help you notice things about them to compliment.
① The key is to put your own self-centered thoughts aside 
and become genuinely interested in other people. ② When 
you give people a genuine, sincere compliment about a 
trait or accomplishment, you’ve given them a valuable 
gift. ③ However, too expensive a gift can cause a person to 
feel uncomfortable. ④You make them feel valued, acknowledged, 
and important. ⑤ When people feel this way, their self-esteem 
goes up, they like themselves more, and because of this, they 
find you likeable. 
36. On the surface, some products are easier to sell online 
than others. For instance, anything that can be delivered in a 
digital format is likely to do well online and we have already 
seen the decline of traditional record shops and photo 
processors. ① However, there are many products which 
benefit from being touched or experienced in some way before 
being purchased. ② Thus a customer may wish to test-drive a 
new car before buying it or feel the weight of a piece of furniture 
to assess its solidity. ③ Michael de Kare-Silver suggests that a 
product’s propensity to online selling depends to a certain 
degree on which of the five senses it appeals to. ④ Although not 
all the risks of online shopping can be eliminated, a great deal of 
them can be avoided by choices the customer makes. ⑤Thus, 
products which are sold on the basis of sight or sound alone can 
be sold online relatively easily, whereas those appealing to 
the senses of touch, taste, or smell cannot. [3점]

Dieter Rams, a German industrial designer, is driven by the 
idea that almost everything is noise. He believes very few 
things are essential. His job is to filter through that noise 
until he gets to the essence.  
(A) It took courage, as it always does, to eliminate the 
non-essential. By the sixties this aesthetic started to 
become more and more popular. In time it became the 
design every other record player followed.
(B) For example, when he was the lead designer at a company, 
he was asked to collaborate on a record player. The norm 
at the time was to cover the turntable in a solid wooden lid 
or even to incorporate the player into a piece of living 
room furniture. 
(C) Instead, he and his team removed the clutter and designed 
a player with a clear plastic cover on the top and nothing 
more. It was the first time such a design had been used, 
and it was so revolutionary that people worried it might 
bankrupt the company because nobody would buy it.

Metals are fundamentally different from these other 
materials because they can be hammered into shape.
During the Stone Age, our ancestor’s tools were made of flint, 
wood, and bone. ( ① ) Anyone who has ever tried to make 
anything with these kinds of tools knows how limiting they are: 
if you hit a piece of wood it either cracks or snaps. ( ② ) Not 
only that, they get stronger when you hit them; you can harden 
a blade just by hammering it. ( ③ ) And you can reverse the 
process simply by putting metal in a fire and heating it up, 
which will cause it to get softer. ( ④ ) The first people to 
discover these properties ten thousand years ago had found a 
material that was almost as hard as rock but behaved like a 
plastic and was almost infinitely reusable. ( ⑤ ) In other 
words, they had discovered the perfect material for tools, and 
in particular cutting tools like axes and razors.  
39. 
In this view, people aren’t cold theorizers who are making 
judgments about other creatures. 
Philosophers have long argued about the process people use to 
understand one another. Some believe that we are careful 
theorizers. ( ① ) We come up with hypotheses about how other 
people will behave, and then test those hypotheses against the 
evidence we observe minute by minute. ( ② ) In this theory, 
people come across as rational scientists, constantly weighing 
evidence and testing explanations. ( ③ ) And there’s clear 
evidence that this sort of hypothesis testing is part of how we 
understand one another. ( ④ ) But these days most of the 
research supports the idea that we automatically simulate 
others, and understand what others feel by feeling what they 
are experiencing, in ourselves. ( ⑤ ) They are unconscious 
actors who understand by sharing or at least simulating the 
responses they see in the people around them. [3점]

More than 40 years ago, psychologist Sibylle Escalona 
carried out what has become a classic study of the play 
behaviors of 128 infants and their mothers. Her major finding 
was that, even if the infants had a large variety of toys to 
play with, the sensorimotor play of babies playing alone was 
less sustained than that of babies who had an adult to interact 
with. The mothers seemed to be skilled social directors. 
They tended to adapt the play activities to the immediate 
needs of children by varying their own activities in response 
to what the children were doing. For example, mothers would 
vary the rate at which they offered new play materials and 
introduce variations or increase the intensity of play when the 
children seemed to be losing interest. As a result, the 
mothers were able to sustain their children’s interest in the 
various play activities and thereby increase the length of their 
attention spans. 
* sensorimotor: 감각 운동의

In one study, it was found that the (A)  role played by 
mothers helped infants to be (B)  to their play 
activities for longer than those with limited access to adults.

① guiding …… attentive
② guiding …… indifferent

From the moment instant baking mixes of all kinds were 
introduced in the late 1940s, they had a strong presence in 
American grocery carts, and ultimately at the dinner table. 
However, not all mixes were greeted with equal enthusiasm. 
Housewives were peculiarly reluctant to use instant cake 
mixes, which required simply adding water. Some marketers 
wondered whether the cake mixes were too sweet or 
artificial-tasting. But no one could explain why the mixes 
used to make biscuits, having pretty much the same basic 
ingredients, were so popular, while cake mixes didn’t sell.
One explanation was that the cake mixes simplified the 
process to such an extent that the women did not feel as 
though the cakes they made were “theirs.” Normally, biscuits 
are not a dish by themselves. A housewife could happily 
receive a compliment on a dish that included a purchased 
component without feeling that it was inappropriately earned. 
A cake, on the other hand, is often served by itself and 
represents a complete dish. On top of that, cakes often carry 
great                 significance, symbolizing special occasions. 
A would-be baker would hardly be willing to consider herself 
someone who makes birthday cakes from “just a mix.” Not 
only would she feel humiliated or guilty but she might also 
disappoint her guests. They would feel that they were not 
being treated to something special.

(A)
Jason was ten years old and loved baseball, but he suffered 
from physical disabilities. His father, Bob, wanted to protect 
(a) him, and so he played catch with him in their back yard 
and avoided any community games. One day Bob got home 
from work and asked Jason if he wanted to play catch, but 
Jason hung his head and said no. 
(B)
When Jason finally hit the ball after seven swings, it didn’t go 
far, but the kids who knew Jason started yelling, “Run, Jason! 
Run!” Their voices were soon joined by those of all the 
players, on both teams. Everyone was cheering and Jason’s 
face glowed when (b) he finally scored. He shouted, “I did it 
Daddy! I did it!” Tears slid down Bob’s cheeks as he hugged 
his joyful son. 
(C)
At the coach’s suggestion, Jason was very excited, and 
(c) he hurried to put on his baseball gear. Most of the kids 
on the town team recognized Jason from school, but no one 
from the other team knew him. However, they could see 
that (d) he was different by the way he moved as he ran 
onto the field to hit the ball for his team. To make it easier 
for Jason, the pitcher moved in closer, threw the ball 
gently, and kept throwing until he could hit one. 
(D)
Bob wondered why Jason said no, and when (e) he asked, 
Jason started to cry: “I want to play on a team, Daddy. Why 
won’t you let me play with the other kids?” Although Bob was 
worried that Jason might be teased or mocked by the other 
kids, he decided to take the risk, and so he brought Jason to 
the town baseball field that evening. When they arrived at the 
field, it turned out that a baseball game was about to start. 
Bob talked to the coach about Jason, and the coach invited 
Jason to play.
