The 18th century is called the Golden Age of botanical 
painting, and Georg Dionysius Ehret is often praised as the 
greatest botanical artist of the time. Born in Heidelberg, 
Germany, he was the son of a gardener who taught him much 
about art and nature. As a young man, Ehret traveled around 
Europe, largely on foot, observing plants and developing his 
artistic skills. In Holland, he became acquainted with the 
Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Through his collaborations with 
Linnaeus and others, Ehret provided illustrations for a number 
of significant horticultural publications. Ehret’s reputation for 
scientific accuracy gained him many commissions from wealthy 
patrons, particularly in England, where he eventually settled.
