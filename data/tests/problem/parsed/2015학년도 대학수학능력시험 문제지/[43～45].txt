(A)
In my office, I have a framed letter from a couple of children 
I have never met. The letter holds a special significance for me. 
It reads, “Dear Dr. Brown, thanks for teaching Mr. Wills to 
teach Tisha and Kelly.” Mr. Wills is Jeremy Wills, and (a) he is 
one of my former students. A few years back, he took my 
positive psychology class in college.
(B)
Before long, the reality hit Jeremy hard. Even after 
spending many hours each day preparing lesson plans, it 
became clear that his methods were not working. One of the 
worst moments was when (b) he distributed a math test. 
Many students didn’t even look at the exam. They just put 
their heads on their desks and slept. Jeremy became so 
stressed that he even dreaded going into his classroom.
(C)
After graduation, Jeremy joined an organization that 
recruits future leaders to teach in low-income communities. 
(c) He was assigned to a small school in a poor rural county 
in North Carolina. Later, his assistant principal took note of 
Jeremy’s high expectations and asked him to take over (d) his 
math class. He took charge of about a dozen failing “special ed” 
kids, and Tisha and Kelly were among them. His idealism 
ran high, and he thought he would be able to magically fix 
all of their problems.
(D)
Jeremy knew something had to change. (e) He then thought 
back to my class, remembering how negative emotions can 
drag you down, leaving positive emotions unnoticed. That’s 
when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes 
within the classroom. He borrowed lessons from my positive 
psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students. 
As the students’ attitudes became more optimistic, their 
confidence with math grew too. At the end of the school year, 
80 percent of Jeremy’s students passed the state’s math test.
