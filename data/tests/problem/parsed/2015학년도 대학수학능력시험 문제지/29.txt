Nancy was struggling to see the positive when ① her teen 
daughter was experiencing a negative perspective on her life 
and abilities. In her desire to parent intentionally, ② she went 
into her daughter’s room and noted one positive accomplishment 
she had observed. “I know you’ve been having a hard time 
lately, and you aren’t feeling really good or positive about 
your life. But you did a great job cleaning up your room 
today, and ③ I know that must have been a big effort for you.” 
The next day, to Nancy’s surprise, the teen girl seemed 
somewhat cheerful. In passing, ④ she said, “Mom, thanks for 
saying the positive thing about me yesterday. I was feeling so 
down and couldn’t think of anything good about myself. After 
⑤ you said that positive thing, it helped me see one good 
quality in myself, and I’ve been holding onto those words.”
