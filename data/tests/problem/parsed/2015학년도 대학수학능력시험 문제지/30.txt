While the eye sees at the surface, the ear tends to penetrate 
below the surface. Joachim-Ernst Berendt points out that the ear 
is the only sense that (A) fuses / replaces an ability to measure 
with an ability to judge. We can discern different colors, but 
we can give a precise number to different sounds. Our eyes do 
not let us perceive with this kind of (B) diversity / precision . An 
unmusical person can recognize an octave and, perhaps once 
instructed, a quality of tone, that is, a C or an F-sharp. Berendt 
points out that there are few ‘acoustical illusions’― something 
sounding like something that in fact it is not― while there are 
many optical illusions. The ears do not lie. The sense of 
hearing gives us a remarkable connection with the invisible, 
underlying order of things. Through our ears we gain access to 
vibration, which (C) underlies / undermines everything around 
us. The sense of tone and music in another’s voice gives us an 
enormous amount of information about that person, about her 
stance toward life, about her intentions.
