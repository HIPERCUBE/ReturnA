38.
The researchers had made this happen by lengthening the 
period of daylight to which the peach trees on whose roots 
the insects fed were exposed. 
Exactly how cicadas keep track of time has always intrigued 
researchers, and it has always been assumed that the insects 
must rely on an internal clock. Recently, however, one group 
of scientists working with the 17-year cicada in California 
have suggested that the nymphs use an external cue and that 
they can count. ( ① ) For their experiments they took 
15-year-old nymphs and moved them to an experimental 
enclosure. ( ② ) These nymphs should have taken a further 
two years to emerge as adults, but in fact they took just one 
year. ( ③ ) By doing this, the trees were “tricked” into 
flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once. 
( ④ ) Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid 
concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on. ( ⑤ ) So it 
seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the 
peaks.
