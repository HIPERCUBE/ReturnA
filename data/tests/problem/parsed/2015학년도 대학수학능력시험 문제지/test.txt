18. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
One difference between winners and losers is how they handle 
losing. Even for the best companies and most accomplished 
professionals, long track records of success are punctuated by 
slips, slides, and mini-turnarounds. Even the team that wins 
the game might make mistakes and lag behind for part of it. 
That’s why the ability to recover quickly is so important. 
Troubles are ubiquitous. Surprises can fall from the sky like 
volcanic ash and appear to change everything. That’s why one 
prominent scholar said, “Anything can look like a failure in 
the middle.” Thus, a key factor in high achievement is 
bouncing back from the low points.
① 경영의 전문화는 일류 기업의 조건이다.
② 위기 관리에는 전문가의 조언이 필요하다.
③ 합리적 소비는 필요와 욕구의 구분에서 비롯된다.
④ 폭넓은 인간 관계는 성공의 필수 요소이다.
⑤ 실패를 빨리 극복하는 것이 성공의 열쇠이다.

As I walked to the train station, I felt the warm sun on my 
back. I caught my train on time. It arrived at my destination ten 
minutes early, which was perfect, as I was due to present my 
new idea to the company at 10 a.m. The presentation went better 
than expected, and my manager seemed particularly pleased. 
Later that day, my manager called me into her office. She smiled 
at me and said, “James, you’ve been with us for six years now. 
How would you feel if I were to offer you the Sales Director 
position in London?” Sales Director in London! Wow! This was 
a dream come true for me. I couldn’t believe what I had just heard!

20. Many disciplines are better learned by entering into the 
doing than by mere abstract study. This is often the case with 
the most abstract as well as the seemingly more practical 
disciplines. For example, within the philosophical disciplines, 
logic must be learned through the use of examples and actual 
problem solving. Only after some time and struggle does the 
student begin to develop the insights and intuitions that enable 
him to see the centrality and relevance of this mode of 
thinking. This learning by doing is essential in many of the 
sciences. For instance, only after a good deal of observation do 
the sparks in the bubble chamber become recognizable as the 
specific movements of identifiable particles.
① history of science education
② limitations of learning strategies
③ importance of learning by doing
④ effects of intuition on scientific discoveries
⑤ difference between philosophy and science
21. The most normal and competent child encounters what 
seem like insurmountable problems in living. But by playing 
them out, he may become able to cope with them in a 
step-by-step process. He often does so in symbolic ways that 
are hard for even him to understand, as he is reacting to inner 
processes whose origin may be buried deep in his 
unconscious. This may result in play that makes little sense to 
us at the moment, since we do not know the purposes it 
serves. When there is no immediate danger, it is usually best 
to approve of the child’s play without interfering. Efforts to 
assist him in his struggles, while well intentioned, may divert 
him from seeking and eventually finding the solution that will 
serve him best.
① dangers of playing violent games to mental health
② beneficial influence of playing outdoors in childhood 
③ children’s play as problem solving with minimal intervention 
④ necessity of intervening in disputes between siblings
⑤ parental roles in children’s physical development

22. At some time in their lives, most people pause to reflect on 
their own moral principles and on the practical implications of 
those principles, and they sometimes think about what 
principles people should have or which moral standards can 
be best justified. When a person accepts a moral principle, 
naturally the person believes the principle is important and 
well justified. But there is more to moral principles than that. 
When a principle is part of a person’s moral code, that person 
is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the 
principle, and against behavior that conflicts with that 
principle. The person will tend to feel guilty when his or her 
own conduct violates that principle and to disapprove of 
others whose behavior conflicts with it. Likewise, the person 
will tend to hold in esteem those whose conduct shows an 
abundance of the motivation required by the principle.
① Feeling Guilty? Check Your Self-Esteem First
② Do Not Let Your Moral Principles Change!
③ Moral Integrity: A Principle of Philosophy
④ How Do People Form Their Personalities?
⑤ Moral Principles: Guiding Our Conduct
23. The key to successful risk taking is to understand that the 
actions you’re taking should be the natural next step. One of 
the mistakes we often make when confronting a risk situation 
is our tendency to focus on the end result. Skiers who are 
unsure of themselves often do this. They’ll go to the edge of a 
difficult slope, look all the way down to the bottom, and 
determine that the slope is too steep for them to try. The ones 
that decide to make it change their focus by analyzing what 
they need to do to master the first step, like getting through 
the first mogul on the hill. Once they get there, they 
concentrate on the next mogul, and over the course of the run, 
they end up at the bottom of what others thought was an 
impossible mountain.
* mogul: 모굴(스키의 활주 사면에 있는 단단한 눈 더미)
① Separating the Possible from the Impossible
② Focus on the Next Step, Not the Final Result
③ Start with Ultimate Goals in Mind!
④ The Wonders of Committed Efforts
⑤ Success Through Risk Avoidance
24. Georg Dionysius Ehret에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 
않는 것은?
The 18th century is called the Golden Age of botanical 
painting, and Georg Dionysius Ehret is often praised as the 
greatest botanical artist of the time. Born in Heidelberg, 
Germany, he was the son of a gardener who taught him much 
about art and nature. As a young man, Ehret traveled around 
Europe, largely on foot, observing plants and developing his 
artistic skills. In Holland, he became acquainted with the 
Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Through his collaborations with 
Linnaeus and others, Ehret provided illustrations for a number 
of significant horticultural publications. Ehret’s reputation for 
scientific accuracy gained him many commissions from wealthy 
patrons, particularly in England, where he eventually settled.

During the early stages when the aquaculture industry was 
rapidly expanding, mistakes were made and these were costly 
both in terms of direct losses and in respect of the industry’s 
image. High-density rearing led to outbreaks of infectious 
diseases that in some cases ① devastated not just the caged 
fish, but local wild fish populations too. The negative impact 
on local wildlife inhabiting areas ② close to the fish farms 
continues to be an ongoing public relations problem for the 
industry. Furthermore, a general lack of knowledge and 
insufficient care being taken when fish pens were initially 
constructed ③ meaning that pollution from excess feed and 
fish waste created huge barren underwater deserts. These were 
costly lessons to learn, but now stricter regulations are in 
place to ensure that fish pens are placed in sites ④ where there 
is good water flow to remove fish waste. This, in addition to 
other methods that decrease the overall amount of uneaten 
food, ⑤ has helped aquaculture to clean up its act.


33. According to a renowned French scholar, the growth in the 
size and complexity of human populations was the driving 
force in the evolution of science. Early, small communities had 
to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival; 
their thoughts were focused on food and religion. As 
communities became larger, some people had time to reflect 
and debate. They found that they could understand and predict 
events better if they reduced passion and prejudice, replacing 
these with observation and inference. But while a large 
population may have been necessary, in itself it was not 
sufficient for science to germinate. Some empires were big, 
but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together 
was not beneficial to science, just as it was not beneficial to 
reason. The early nurturing and later flowering of science      
to support 
original thought and freewheeling incentive. The rise in 
commerce and the decline of authoritarian religion allowed 
science to follow reason in seventeenth-century Europe. [3점]
* germinate: 싹트다, 발아하다
① prompted small communities to adopt harsh social norms
② resulted from passion and enthusiasm rather than inference
③ occurred in large communities with strict hierarchical structures
④ were solely attributed to efforts of survival in a small community
⑤ required a large and loosely structured, competitive community

New media can be defined by four characteristics 
simultaneously: they are media at the turn of the 20th and 21st 
centuries which are both integrated and interactive and use 
digital code and hypertext as technical means. It follows that 
their most common alternative names are multimedia, 
interactive media and digital media. By using this definition, 
it is easy to identify media as old or new. (A) , 
traditional television is integrated as it contains images, sound 
and text, but it is not interactive or based on digital code. The 
plain old telephone was interactive, but not integrated as it 
only transmitted speech and sounds and it did not work with 
digital code. In contrast, the new medium of interactive 
television adds interactivity and digital code. (B) , 
the new generations of mobile or fixed telephony are fully 
digitalized and integrated as they add text, pictures or video 
and they are connected to the Internet.

① For example …… Additionally
② Nevertheless …… In other words
③ Therefore …… Additionally
④ For example …… In other words

A currently popular attitude is to blame technology or 
technologists for having brought on the environmental 
problems we face today, and thus to try to slow technological 
advance by blocking economic growth. We believe this view 
to be thoroughly misguided. ① If technology produced 
automobiles that pollute the air, it is because pollution was not 
recognized as a problem which engineers had to consider in 
their designs. ② Solar energy can be a practical alternative 
energy source for us in the foreseeable future. ③ Obviously, 
technology that produces pollution is generally cheaper, but 
now that it has been decided that cleaner cars are wanted, less 
polluting cars will be produced; cars which scarcely pollute at 

all could even be made. ④ This last option, however, would 
require several years and much investment. ⑤ Although 
technology is responsive to the will of the people, it can 
seldom respond instantaneously and is never free.

The impact of color has been studied for decades. For 
example, in a factory, the temperature was maintained at 
72℉ and the walls were painted a cool blue-green. The 
employees complained of the cold.
(A) The psychological effects of warm and cool hues seem to 
be used effectively by the coaches of the Notre Dame 
football team. The locker rooms used for half-time breaks 
were reportedly painted to take advantage of the 
emotional impact of certain hues.
(B) The home-team room was painted a bright red, which 
kept team members excited or even angered. The 
visiting-team room was painted a blue-green, which had a 
calming effect on the team members. The success of this 
application of color can be noted in the records set by 
Notre Dame football teams.
(C) The temperature was maintained at the same level, but the 
walls were painted a warm coral. The employees stopped 
complaining about the temperature and reported they 
were quite comfortable.

(A) They walk only a few miles each day and may use the 
same campsite for several nights. Survival eaters eat 
some dry cereal for breakfast, and are up and walking

(B) Wilderness dining has two extremes: gourmet eaters and 
survival eaters. The first like to make camp at lunchtime 
so they have several hours to set up field ovens; they bake 
cakes and bread and cook multi-course dinners.
(C) They walk dozens of miles every day; lunch is a series of

The researchers had made this happen by lengthening the 
period of daylight to which the peach trees on whose roots 
the insects fed were exposed. 
Exactly how cicadas keep track of time has always intrigued 
researchers, and it has always been assumed that the insects 
must rely on an internal clock. Recently, however, one group 
of scientists working with the 17-year cicada in California 
have suggested that the nymphs use an external cue and that 
they can count. ( ① ) For their experiments they took 
15-year-old nymphs and moved them to an experimental 
enclosure. ( ② ) These nymphs should have taken a further 
two years to emerge as adults, but in fact they took just one 
year. ( ③ ) By doing this, the trees were “tricked” into 
flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once. 
( ④ ) Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid 
concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on. ( ⑤ ) So it 
seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the 
peaks.

They also rated how generally extroverted those fake 
extroverts appeared, based on their recorded voices and 
body language.
Some years ago, a psychologist named Richard Lippa called 
a group of introverts to his lab and asked them to act like 
extroverts while pretending to teach a math class. ( ① ) Then 
he and his team, with video cameras in hand, measured the 
length of their strides, the amount of eye contact they made 
with their “students,” the percentage of time they spent 
talking, and the volume of their speech. ( ② ) Then Lippa 
did the same thing with actual extroverts and compared the 
results. ( ③ ) He found that although the latter group came 
across as more extroverted, some of the fake extroverts were 
surprisingly convincing. ( ④ ) It seems that most of us 
know how to fake it to some extent. ( ⑤ ) Whether or not 
we’re aware that the length of our strides and the amount of 
time we spend talking and smiling mark us as introverts and 
extroverts, we know it unconsciously. [3점]

Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly 
established that certain works have certain effects. Plato is 
sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us 
cowardly; the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress 
such representations. Tolstoy is confident that the artist 
who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those 
feelings on to us; we can no more escape than we could 
escape an infectious disease. In fact, however, the effects 
of art are neither so certain nor so direct. People vary a 
great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and 
in the form which that response takes. Some people may 
indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of 
working out those fantasies in real life. Others may be 
disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence. 
Still others may be left unmoved, neither attracted nor 
disgusted.

Increased size affects group life in a number of ways. There 
is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more 
productive than smaller groups (two or three members). 
Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than 
members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach 
less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences 
may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve 
organizational problems. Members may realize that their 
behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely 
that they can coordinate their actions without making a special 
effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their 
members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone 
to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount 
of influence on decisions.
There is evidence that groups with an even number of 
members differ from groups with an odd number of members. 
The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more 
deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of 
members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups 
with an odd number of members― one side always has a 
numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the 
number five has special significance. Groups of this size 
usually the problems we have just outlined. 
Moreover, they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions 
found in groups of two or three. Groups of five rate high in 
member satisfaction; because of the odd number of members, 
deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur.

(A)
In my office, I have a framed letter from a couple of children 
I have never met. The letter holds a special significance for me. 
It reads, “Dear Dr. Brown, thanks for teaching Mr. Wills to 
teach Tisha and Kelly.” Mr. Wills is Jeremy Wills, and (a) he is 
one of my former students. A few years back, he took my 
positive psychology class in college.
(B)
Before long, the reality hit Jeremy hard. Even after 
spending many hours each day preparing lesson plans, it 
became clear that his methods were not working. One of the 
worst moments was when (b) he distributed a math test. 
Many students didn’t even look at the exam. They just put 
their heads on their desks and slept. Jeremy became so 
stressed that he even dreaded going into his classroom.
(C)
After graduation, Jeremy joined an organization that 
recruits future leaders to teach in low-income communities. 
(c) He was assigned to a small school in a poor rural county 
in North Carolina. Later, his assistant principal took note of 
Jeremy’s high expectations and asked him to take over (d) his 
math class. He took charge of about a dozen failing “special ed” 
kids, and Tisha and Kelly were among them. His idealism 
ran high, and he thought he would be able to magically fix 
all of their problems.
(D)
Jeremy knew something had to change. (e) He then thought 
back to my class, remembering how negative emotions can 
drag you down, leaving positive emotions unnoticed. That’s 
when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes 
within the classroom. He borrowed lessons from my positive 
psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students. 
As the students’ attitudes became more optimistic, their 
confidence with math grew too. At the end of the school year, 
80 percent of Jeremy’s students passed the state’s math test.
