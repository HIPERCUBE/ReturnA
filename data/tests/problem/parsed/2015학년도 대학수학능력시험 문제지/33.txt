33. According to a renowned French scholar, the growth in the 
size and complexity of human populations was the driving 
force in the evolution of science. Early, small communities had 
to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival; 
their thoughts were focused on food and religion. As 
communities became larger, some people had time to reflect 
and debate. They found that they could understand and predict 
events better if they reduced passion and prejudice, replacing 
these with observation and inference. But while a large 
population may have been necessary, in itself it was not 
sufficient for science to germinate. Some empires were big, 
but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together 
was not beneficial to science, just as it was not beneficial to 
reason. The early nurturing and later flowering of science      
to support 
original thought and freewheeling incentive. The rise in 
commerce and the decline of authoritarian religion allowed 
science to follow reason in seventeenth-century Europe. [3점]
