During the early stages when the aquaculture industry was 
rapidly expanding, mistakes were made and these were costly 
both in terms of direct losses and in respect of the industry’s 
image. High-density rearing led to outbreaks of infectious 
diseases that in some cases ① devastated not just the caged 
fish, but local wild fish populations too. The negative impact 
on local wildlife inhabiting areas ② close to the fish farms 
continues to be an ongoing public relations problem for the 
industry. Furthermore, a general lack of knowledge and 
insufficient care being taken when fish pens were initially 
constructed ③ meaning that pollution from excess feed and 
fish waste created huge barren underwater deserts. These were 
costly lessons to learn, but now stricter regulations are in 
place to ensure that fish pens are placed in sites ④ where there 
is good water flow to remove fish waste. This, in addition to 
other methods that decrease the overall amount of uneaten 
food, ⑤ has helped aquaculture to clean up its act.
