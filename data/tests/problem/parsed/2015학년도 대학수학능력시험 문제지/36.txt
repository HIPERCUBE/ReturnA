The impact of color has been studied for decades. For 
example, in a factory, the temperature was maintained at 
72℉ and the walls were painted a cool blue-green. The 
employees complained of the cold.
(A) The psychological effects of warm and cool hues seem to 
be used effectively by the coaches of the Notre Dame 
football team. The locker rooms used for half-time breaks 
were reportedly painted to take advantage of the 
emotional impact of certain hues.
(B) The home-team room was painted a bright red, which 
kept team members excited or even angered. The 
visiting-team room was painted a blue-green, which had a 
calming effect on the team members. The success of this 
application of color can be noted in the records set by 
Notre Dame football teams.
(C) The temperature was maintained at the same level, but the 
walls were painted a warm coral. The employees stopped 
complaining about the temperature and reported they 
were quite comfortable.
