Bright sunlight filters through the ever-present playground
dust. A group of children are playing baseball on the ground.
In the distance, there is the faint sound of shouting, a crowd
coming closer. Then the crowd bursts through the
playground and makes for the airfield. The children see the
crowd surging around the field and charging toward a landing
helicopter. They also run for the helicopter. A famous movie
star Bruce Rain gets out of the helicopter. A boy at the

star takes it and scribbles his autograph on it. He hands the
photograph back to the boy as his bodyguards surround him
and hustle him into a car.
