42. All top performers know they cannot stand still for long.
They always look for ways to improve. Tony Gwynn, the
player who won three batting championships, says, “Once
you think you’re where you want to be, you’re not there any

successful is never to rest on our success, never to feel
like we’ve done it. The moment you feel like you’ve done it,
that’s the beginning of the end. One of the best basketball
players of the 1980s, Larry Bird, is another great example.
In his off season, he works to keep improving his skills.
One summer, for example, Bird lifted weights; another
summer he made a court on his mother’s front lawn, just “to
learn some new moves.”
