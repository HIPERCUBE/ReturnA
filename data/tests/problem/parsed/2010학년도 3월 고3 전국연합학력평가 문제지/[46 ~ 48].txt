(A) South Pole explorer Ernest Shackleton never reached
his goal of crossing Antarctica, but the circumstances that
prevented him from reaching that goal pushed him to
achieve an even more amazing feat. In January 1915
Shackleton’s ship Endurance became trapped in ice off
Antarctica. He and his crew of twenty-seven lived on the
ship trapped in the ice for nine months until they had to
abandon their ship when the ice crushed the boat.
(B) In addition, they had to hunt scarce seals and
penguins for food, and were attacked by killer whales and
sea leopards, which would rise through the ice in search of
prey. Throughout this time, Shackleton demonstrated his
leadership by rationing food, rotating use of the warmer
sleeping bags, and keeping a calm, positive attitude that
helped morale. He also showed great courage as he and five
of his men crossed eight hundred miles of dangerous ocean
to the nearest inhabited island to seek help.
(C) Despite no maps and terrible weather, Shackleton’s
small boat reached the island, where Shackleton and an
even smaller group organized a rescue party to retrieve the
rest of his crew. Despite the perils of living in south polar
waters for almost two years, all twenty-seven men
eventually came back from the expedition. Shackleton never
crossed the South Pole, but he completed the greatest task
of bringing back all of his crew alive.
(D) The day the ship sank, Shackleton wrote his new
goal: “The task is to reach land with all members of the
Expedition.” The group camped on the ice for six months,
until the ice broke up and they took small lifeboats to
nearby uninhabited Elephant Island. During their time on the
ice, boat, and island, Shackleton’s group had to endure
temperatures as low as twenty degrees below zero and had
no daylight from May to July.
