I somewhat disagree with everyone saying Mr. Peterson’s
class is boring and too demanding. I’ve had Mr. Peterson for
Statistics Ⅰ and Ⅱ, and I can honestly say that he is
detail-oriented and expects a lot from his students. But
statistics is about details, facts, and effort among other
things. If you’re looking for an easy A, think about taking an
easier class; you won’t have to complain about homework or
low grades. Mr. Peterson knows his stuff, has a lot of
experience, and is very approachable. When I had him, I
didn’t get many poor remarks; on the rare occasions I did, it
didn’t affect my grade. Overall, this is a class that will give
you as much as you put into it.
