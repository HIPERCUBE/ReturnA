33. Flying off to a foreign country for affordable cosmetic
surgery has been a popular option for years. But now,
because of rising health care costs, travelers are going
abroad for routine surgeries and procedures. By 2012,
experts predict, medical tourism will turn into a $100 billion
international industry with more than 780 million patients
seeking health care abroad. The line between vacation and
health care will continue to blur. Next year Singapore will
open Asia’s first medical hotel, a 260-room luxury
high-rise connected to the east wing of the new hospital in
Farrer Park. The hotel will feature a 500-seat conference
hall, indoor and outdoor gardens, and a spa, as well as
various medical equipment for patients who don’t want to
stay in the hospital. It will add new meaning to the concept
of a healing holiday.
