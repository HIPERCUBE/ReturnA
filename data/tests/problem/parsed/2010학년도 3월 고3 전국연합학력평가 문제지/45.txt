The TRI was one of the most successful environment
programs in American history. Its original goal was
simply to require companies to report their toxic
discharges, so that state and federal governments would
know about existing practices. But to stimulate extensive
reductions, the media placed a spotlight on the worst
offenders, leading them to do much better. The worst
industrial air toxic polluter in New York City, for
example, was subject to an extensive media campaign,
one that led to large-scale emissions reductions.
Hundreds of local and national articles targeted “the top
polluters” in relevant areas. The result was to create a
kind of blacklisting. No company wanted to be ranked
among the worst, which led to a 45 percent decrease of
toxic discharges between 1988 and 1995.
(A) pressure helped solve (B) problems.
(A) (B)
① Media …… environmental
② Media …… economic
③ Peer …… economic
④ Consumer …… cultural
⑤ Consumer …… environmental

(A) South Pole explorer Ernest Shackleton never reached
his goal of crossing Antarctica, but the circumstances that
prevented him from reaching that goal pushed him to
achieve an even more amazing feat. In January 1915
Shackleton’s ship Endurance became trapped in ice off
Antarctica. He and his crew of twenty-seven lived on the
ship trapped in the ice for nine months until they had to
abandon their ship when the ice crushed the boat.
(B) In addition, they had to hunt scarce seals and
penguins for food, and were attacked by killer whales and
sea leopards, which would rise through the ice in search of
prey. Throughout this time, Shackleton demonstrated his
leadership by rationing food, rotating use of the warmer
sleeping bags, and keeping a calm, positive attitude that
helped morale. He also showed great courage as he and five
of his men crossed eight hundred miles of dangerous ocean
to the nearest inhabited island to seek help.
(C) Despite no maps and terrible weather, Shackleton’s
small boat reached the island, where Shackleton and an
even smaller group organized a rescue party to retrieve the
rest of his crew. Despite the perils of living in south polar
waters for almost two years, all twenty-seven men
eventually came back from the expedition. Shackleton never
crossed the South Pole, but he completed the greatest task
of bringing back all of his crew alive.
(D) The day the ship sank, Shackleton wrote his new
goal: “The task is to reach land with all members of the
Expedition.” The group camped on the ice for six months,
until the ice broke up and they took small lifeboats to
nearby uninhabited Elephant Island. During their time on the
ice, boat, and island, Shackleton’s group had to endure
temperatures as low as twenty degrees below zero and had
no daylight from May to July.

Arun was ten years old. He came from a poor family in
India. He kept missing days in his government school. The
teacher tried getting him interested in what the class was
doing, but he was inattentive. She felt that he had a
learning disability.
There was a group near school which helped children
after school hours with homework and with revision of the
day’s subjects. This ‘evening school’, near the slum where
Arun lived, was asked by this teacher if they could spend
more time with him and find out why he missed school and
was so inattentive. After six months (Arun went regularly
to this evening school, never missing a day), the helper
there said that Arun assisted his father in repairing bicycles
and enjoyed this work. So, the evening school helpers began
their program to the government school education
by starting with what Arun knew and liked: bicycles.
From that starting point, he learned about metals, about
physics and chemistry, and he learned two languages. He
then began to follow the lessons in his government school,
and enjoyed studying and learning new things. Arun grew
up to do well in his school-leaving examination, and is now
at a university learning engineering― his main passion.
