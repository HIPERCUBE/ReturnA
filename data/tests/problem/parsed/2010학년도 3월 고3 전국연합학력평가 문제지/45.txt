The TRI was one of the most successful environment
programs in American history. Its original goal was
simply to require companies to report their toxic
discharges, so that state and federal governments would
know about existing practices. But to stimulate extensive
reductions, the media placed a spotlight on the worst
offenders, leading them to do much better. The worst
industrial air toxic polluter in New York City, for
example, was subject to an extensive media campaign,
one that led to large-scale emissions reductions.
Hundreds of local and national articles targeted “the top
polluters” in relevant areas. The result was to create a
kind of blacklisting. No company wanted to be ranked
among the worst, which led to a 45 percent decrease of
toxic discharges between 1988 and 1995.
