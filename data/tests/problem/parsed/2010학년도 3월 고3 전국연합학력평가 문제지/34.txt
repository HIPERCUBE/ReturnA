34. We conducted research to find whether people explain
what happened to them positively or negatively. We gave
questionnaires to one hundred children and their parents.
The findings showed that the mother’s level of optimism and
the child’s level were very similar. This was true of both
sons and daughters. We were surprised at the result that
neither the children’s speaking style nor the mother’s style
bore any resemblance to the father’s style. This tells us
that young children listen to what their primary caretaker
(usually the mother) says. If the child has an optimistic
mother, this is great, but it can be a disaster for the child if
the child has a pessimistic mother.
