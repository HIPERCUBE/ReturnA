Arun was ten years old. He came from a poor family in
India. He kept missing days in his government school. The
teacher tried getting him interested in what the class was
doing, but he was inattentive. She felt that he had a
learning disability.
There was a group near school which helped children
after school hours with homework and with revision of the
day’s subjects. This ‘evening school’, near the slum where
Arun lived, was asked by this teacher if they could spend
more time with him and find out why he missed school and
was so inattentive. After six months (Arun went regularly
to this evening school, never missing a day), the helper
there said that Arun assisted his father in repairing bicycles
and enjoyed this work. So, the evening school helpers began
their program to the government school education
by starting with what Arun knew and liked: bicycles.
From that starting point, he learned about metals, about
physics and chemistry, and he learned two languages. He
then began to follow the lessons in his government school,
and enjoyed studying and learning new things. Arun grew
up to do well in his school-leaving examination, and is now
at a university learning engineering― his main passion.
