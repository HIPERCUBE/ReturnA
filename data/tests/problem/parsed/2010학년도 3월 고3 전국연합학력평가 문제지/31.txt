Scientists are looking into the seas in search of medicines
that may work better, with fewer side effects, than
conventional drugs. ①The ocean has already given us
wonderful drugs derived from salmon, omega-3 fish oils for
heart disease and bone replacements from coral. ②Another
marine medicine in the works is a promising new cancer
drug derived from bacteria that live inside a moss-like sea
creature. ③ Some fish farms tend to use several antibiotic
drugs known to cause cancer to increase their production. ④
Unlike conventional drugs that kill cancer cells, the drug
makes them go back to normal cells. ⑤And some antibiotics
being made from cells in fish may even be effective against
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
