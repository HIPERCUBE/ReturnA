18. 밑줄 친 this가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
I used to hear Chopin, but recently I listen to Mozart
because everybody says listening to Mozart’s music will
make me smart. I also hear many stories including Aesop’s
fables and Andersen’s fairy tales. My favorite story is “The
Frog Prince,” and I’ve almost learned it by heart because
I’ve heard it dozens of times. These days some stories are
told in a foreign language, but I can’t understand them very
well because the language is not my mother tongue. Apart
from listening to music and stories, you will never know
how many things I learn through this. Although I am still
inside my mom and have never seen the world through my
own eyes, I feel I’m quite familiar with the world outside
thanks to this. I can’t wait to see the people who have been
nurturing and communicating with me for nine months.
