I used to hear Chopin, but recently I listen to Mozart
because everybody says listening to Mozart’s music will
make me smart. I also hear many stories including Aesop’s
fables and Andersen’s fairy tales. My favorite story is “The
Frog Prince,” and I’ve almost learned it by heart because
I’ve heard it dozens of times. These days some stories are
told in a foreign language, but I can’t understand them very
well because the language is not my mother tongue. Apart
from listening to music and stories, you will never know
how many things I learn through this. Although I am still
inside my mom and have never seen the world through my
own eyes, I feel I’m quite familiar with the world outside
thanks to this. I can’t wait to see the people who have been
nurturing and communicating with me for nine months.

A salesman called on a young grocer named Barney,
trying to sell him canned corn. The salesman was especially
proud of the fancy label on the can. He said that the
customers wouldn’t be able to resist it, so Barney decided
to give the product a chance. ①He had a small kitchen at
the rear of his store where he tested products. Walking to
the back, ② he tore off the fancy label and deliberately
threw it on the floor. “My customers don’t eat labels. They
eat what’s inside,” ③ he told the salesman, who was
surprised and fell speechless. While ④ he was waiting in
fear, the young grocer opened the can― it was full of hulls!
The grocer didn’t order the canned corn. Word spread and
Barney gained the reputation that ⑤ he sold products of
good quality. * hull: 껍데기, 쭉정이

I somewhat disagree with everyone saying Mr. Peterson’s
class is boring and too demanding. I’ve had Mr. Peterson for
Statistics Ⅰ and Ⅱ, and I can honestly say that he is
detail-oriented and expects a lot from his students. But
statistics is about details, facts, and effort among other
things. If you’re looking for an easy A, think about taking an
easier class; you won’t have to complain about homework or
low grades. Mr. Peterson knows his stuff, has a lot of
experience, and is very approachable. When I had him, I
didn’t get many poor remarks; on the rare occasions I did, it
didn’t affect my grade. Overall, this is a class that will give
you as much as you put into it.
① to decline a job offer
② to recommend a course
③ to hire a new professor
④ to ask for a quick reply
⑤ to complain about grading

coming closer. Then the crowd bursts through the
playground and makes for the airfield. The children see the
crowd surging around the field and charging toward a landing
helicopter. They also run for the helicopter. A famous movie
star Bruce Rain gets out of the helicopter. A boy at the

24. A speaker begins his presentation by reaching into his
pocket, holds up a twenty-dollar bill, and says, “This
twenty is for sale for exactly one dollar. Who wants to buy
it?” Would you leap to your feet to get his attention? Or
would you wait a few seconds, and after a hand or two goes
up, timidly raise your own? If you’re one of the hesitaters,
you’re normal. Once someone else is willing to take a
chance, then our greedy little hands pop up, and we tend to
go along. The faster others’ hands are raised, the greater
the desire, and the more likely we are to be part of it. Our
sense of the value of an object is reinforced by the
that has been created for that object.

25. Women have a more sensitive touch than men because of
their . A professor in McMaster University in
Ontario, Canada and his team measured the surface areas of
index fingers in 100 students and then asked them to feel
surfaces marked with progressively finer grooves. When the
grooves get too narrow for someone’s sense of touch, the
surface feels smooth. On average, men could detect grooves
down to 1.59mm wide, whereas women detected grooves at
1.41mm. The ability to discriminate the grooves on the
surfaces fell by 0.25mm for every square-centimeter
increase in finger area. The team found that sweat pores
and the skin’s touch receptors are more densely packed as
finger size decreases. * groove: 가늘고 긴 홈
① smoother skin ② larger pores
③ cleaner hands ④ thinner bones
⑤ smaller fingers
26. When you are taking an essay test, .
Some experts or teachers must have spent quite a long time
deciding them. Notice the key words. The words in them
have been chosen with great care and mean precisely what
they say. For example, if it asks you to ‘prove’ something,
you should not ‘describe’ or ‘explain’ it. You might get a few
marks even if your answers don’t focus on the word ‘prove’,
but you certainly wouldn’t get full marks. Also, notice
especially where the words are used in the singular and
where they are used in the plural. If a question asks for
‘reasons’, one reason isn’t going to be enough. If it asks for
‘problems’, again one problem isn’t going to be adequate.
① read the questions carefully
② watch out for spelling mistakes
③ use your experience and knowledge
④ distinguish between facts and opinions
⑤ avoid the words used in the given text
27. During the Middle Ages, the Rhine River was a great
European trade route protected by the Holy Roman Empire.
Merchant ships paid a modest toll to safeguard their transit.
However, after the Empire weakened during the thirteenth
century, many freelance barons built castles on the Rhine
and began collecting their own illegal tolls. Each argued that
he had the rights to collect tolls. The growing number of
these “robber baron” tollbooths made shipping unmanageable.
Eventually, the merchants couldn’t afford the tolls. The river
continued to flow, but boatmen would no longer bother
making the journey. Because of the decreased trade, the
European economic pie shrank. Wealth disappeared. As
, everybody lost, even the barons
themselves. * freelance baron: 독립적인 지방 호족
① collecting tolls was prohibited
② technology innovation did not occur
③ all power was concentrated in one person
④ too many people owned pieces of one thing
⑤ merchant groups gained power over the Empire
28. For the first year of sound film, it seemed that audiences
would see any film that “talked.” When audience attendance
dropped by 20 percent in the early part of 1929, however,
film producers had to reexamine their product. Sound had
made almost useless the techniques that directors had
acquired through years of silent films. In effect, sound
. For example, because the noise of the
camera could be picked up by the sound system, the camera
had to be encased in a large heavy soundproof box, which
made the camera stationary. In addition, the actors had to
use the microphones hidden on the set (in telephones,
flower vases, etc.); they could never move away from the
microphones. They often appeared rather odd as they stood
speaking into a vase of flower. [3점]
① increased the cost of producing a movie
② attracted more people to movie theaters
③ forced movie actors to practice a lot more
④ undermined the motion of the motion picture

Would you like to see birds and fish playing together?
Secure two glass vessels having straight sides of the same
① height, one 25 inches in diameter (Figure 1) and the
other 17 inches (Figure 2). The smaller is placed within the
larger, the ② bottoms being covered with moss and
aquarium decorations. Fill the space between the vessels
with water. Cut a piece of copper screen into a ③ circular
form to cover the larger vessel, and hang a bird swing in the
center (Figure 3). Place the screen on top of the vessels so
that the swing will hang in the center of the inner vessel. A
④weight should be placed on top of the screen, over the
smaller vessel, to keep it from floating. Put your canary
birds in the ⑤ outer vessel and some goldfish in the water
between the vessels. Now you have a small world where
birds and fish seem to play together underwater (Figure 4).

For the past two decades, illustrations in children’s books
have become increasingly detailed and obtrusive, while
language has become lessened― sometimes to the point of
extinction. It is not unusual for a book of thirty or more
pages full of repetitive phrases. The artwork is often
marvelous, but the pictures make the language redundant,
and the children have no need to imagine anything when
they read such books. Looking at a picture actively prevents
children younger than nine from creating a mental image,
and can make it difficult for older children. In order to learn
how to read and comprehend, they need to practice making
their own meaning in response to text. They need to have
their innate powers of imagination trained.

38. Adair Paul Neal에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Adair Paul Neal was usually called “Red Adair.” The
nickname “Red” was a natural nickname because of his red
hair, and it became his trademark. Born in Houston, Texas in
1915, he grew up in poverty. He dropped out of high school
to help support the family. Adair held various jobs including
seven years of work in the oil fields before he went into the
army. After the war, Adair went to work for a company
fighting oil well fires. Fearless, he became famous. He was
called out to fires all over the world, including war zones,
because of his company’s experience and expertise.
Hollywood noticed and based a feature film on Adair’s life
starred by John Wayne in 1968. Adair was seventy-nine
years old when he finally retired from firefighting in 1994.

In 2007 scientists discovered a very strange flesh-eating
plant. This plant, called Nepenthes attenboroughii, is so large
that it can swallow and devour rats whole. They are lured
into its slipper-like mouth to drown or die of exhaustion
before being slowly dissolved by digestive enzymes. The
plant is green and red and has a stem that can grow up to
four feet long. It can only be found high up on the
windswept slopes of Mount Victoria in the Philippines. After
hearing of missionaries who had seen “whole rats” being
eaten by the shrub, botanists Stewart McPherson and
Alistair Robinson led a team of scientists to the Asian
nation and uncovered the rare species. This plant was named
after the naturalist broadcaster David Attenborough.

40. While creating a statue, the artist depends on the
appropriate lighting to develop the figure because the quality
of the final product relies on the interplay between light and
shade. So great attention should be paid to lighting when the
finished work is displayed. If a light from a source is
weaker or stronger than when the work was created, the
effect that the sculptor intended may be lost. In painting,
the light and shade give the image shape and solidity that
cannot be altered by an external light in which it is
displayed. When a sculpture is exhibited, however, the
artist’s work is brought to life by light, and its character can
be altered by the control of the light source.

41. Take a liter of rice and pour it all at once through a
funnel and into an empty beaker. Note how long it takes.
Next, take the same rice and pour it, not all at once, but in
a smooth controlled flow and measure how long that process
takes. Which liter of rice gets through more quickly? The
second method takes nearly one-third less time. What
seems slower is actually faster. Likewise, a study conducted
at a jammed tunnel showed that when cars were allowed to
enter the tunnel in the usual way, with no restrictions, the
two-lane tunnel could handle 1,176 cars per hour. But in a
trial, the tunnel authorities limited the number of cars that
could enter the tunnel every two minutes to 44. The result?
The tunnel now handled 1,320 vehicles per hour.

42. All top performers know they cannot stand still for long.
They always look for ways to improve. Tony Gwynn, the
player who won three batting championships, says, “Once
you think you’re where you want to be, you’re not there any
more.” The greatest challenge we have as we become
successful is never to rest on our success, never to feel
like we’ve done it. The moment you feel like you’ve done it,
that’s the beginning of the end. One of the best basketball
players of the 1980s, Larry Bird, is another great example.
In his off season, he works to keep improving his skills.
One summer, for example, Bird lifted weights; another
summer he made a court on his mother’s front lawn, just “to
learn some new moves.”

43. People are wrong to regard play as a frill. Marc Bekoff at
the University of Colorado, studying play behavior in social
animals such as wolves, coyotes, and dogs, concluded that
play allows individuals to try out new things because they
can make mistakes without penalty. “Play encourages taking
reasonable risks,” he says. “It allows you to be flexible and
creative.” The search for novelty and the desire for
something fresh is a hallmark of the state of play. And of
course novelty and freshness are also central to creativity.
At the very least, then, we should equip the next generation
for the inevitable recessions of the future by encouraging
water fights and inviting imaginary friends to join in.

no natural controls in this new territory, they spread

The TRI was one of the most successful environment
programs in American history. Its original goal was
simply to require companies to report their toxic
discharges, so that state and federal governments would
know about existing practices. But to stimulate extensive
reductions, the media placed a spotlight on the worst
offenders, leading them to do much better. The worst
industrial air toxic polluter in New York City, for
example, was subject to an extensive media campaign,
one that led to large-scale emissions reductions.
Hundreds of local and national articles targeted “the top
polluters” in relevant areas. The result was to create a
kind of blacklisting. No company wanted to be ranked
among the worst, which led to a 45 percent decrease of
toxic discharges between 1988 and 1995.

(A) South Pole explorer Ernest Shackleton never reached
his goal of crossing Antarctica, but the circumstances that
prevented him from reaching that goal pushed him to
achieve an even more amazing feat. In January 1915
Shackleton’s ship Endurance became trapped in ice off
Antarctica. He and his crew of twenty-seven lived on the
ship trapped in the ice for nine months until they had to
abandon their ship when the ice crushed the boat.
(B) In addition, they had to hunt scarce seals and
penguins for food, and were attacked by killer whales and
sea leopards, which would rise through the ice in search of
prey. Throughout this time, Shackleton demonstrated his
leadership by rationing food, rotating use of the warmer
sleeping bags, and keeping a calm, positive attitude that
helped morale. He also showed great courage as he and five
of his men crossed eight hundred miles of dangerous ocean
to the nearest inhabited island to seek help.
(C) Despite no maps and terrible weather, Shackleton’s
small boat reached the island, where Shackleton and an
even smaller group organized a rescue party to retrieve the
rest of his crew. Despite the perils of living in south polar
waters for almost two years, all twenty-seven men
eventually came back from the expedition. Shackleton never
crossed the South Pole, but he completed the greatest task
of bringing back all of his crew alive.
(D) The day the ship sank, Shackleton wrote his new
goal: “The task is to reach land with all members of the
Expedition.” The group camped on the ice for six months,
until the ice broke up and they took small lifeboats to
nearby uninhabited Elephant Island. During their time on the
ice, boat, and island, Shackleton’s group had to endure
temperatures as low as twenty degrees below zero and had
no daylight from May to July.

[49 ~ 50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Arun was ten years old. He came from a poor family in
India. He kept missing days in his government school. The
teacher tried getting him interested in what the class was
doing, but he was inattentive. She felt that he had a
learning disability.
There was a group near school which helped children
after school hours with homework and with revision of the
day’s subjects. This ‘evening school’, near the slum where
Arun lived, was asked by this teacher if they could spend
more time with him and find out why he missed school and
was so inattentive. After six months (Arun went regularly
to this evening school, never missing a day), the helper
there said that Arun assisted his father in repairing bicycles
and enjoyed this work. So, the evening school helpers began
their program to the government school education
by starting with what Arun knew and liked: bicycles.
From that starting point, he learned about metals, about
physics and chemistry, and he learned two languages. He
then began to follow the lessons in his government school,
and enjoyed studying and learning new things. Arun grew
up to do well in his school-leaving examination, and is now
at a university learning engineering― his main passion.
