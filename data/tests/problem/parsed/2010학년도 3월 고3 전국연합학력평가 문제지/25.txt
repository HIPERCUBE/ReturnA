25. Women have a more sensitive touch than men because of
their . A professor in McMaster University in
Ontario, Canada and his team measured the surface areas of
index fingers in 100 students and then asked them to feel
surfaces marked with progressively finer grooves. When the
grooves get too narrow for someone’s sense of touch, the
surface feels smooth. On average, men could detect grooves
down to 1.59mm wide, whereas women detected grooves at
1.41mm. The ability to discriminate the grooves on the
surfaces fell by 0.25mm for every square-centimeter
increase in finger area. The team found that sweat pores
and the skin’s touch receptors are more densely packed as
finger size decreases. * groove: 가늘고 긴 홈
