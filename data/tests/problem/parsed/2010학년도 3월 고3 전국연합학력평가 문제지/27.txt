27. During the Middle Ages, the Rhine River was a great
European trade route protected by the Holy Roman Empire.
Merchant ships paid a modest toll to safeguard their transit.
However, after the Empire weakened during the thirteenth
century, many freelance barons built castles on the Rhine
and began collecting their own illegal tolls. Each argued that
he had the rights to collect tolls. The growing number of
these “robber baron” tollbooths made shipping unmanageable.

continued to flow, but boatmen would no longer bother
making the journey. Because of the decreased trade, the
European economic pie shrank. Wealth disappeared. As
