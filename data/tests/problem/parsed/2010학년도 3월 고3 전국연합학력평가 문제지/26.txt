26. When you are taking an essay test, .
Some experts or teachers must have spent quite a long time
deciding them. Notice the key words. The words in them
have been chosen with great care and mean precisely what
they say. For example, if it asks you to ‘prove’ something,
you should not ‘describe’ or ‘explain’ it. You might get a few
marks even if your answers don’t focus on the word ‘prove’,
but you certainly wouldn’t get full marks. Also, notice
especially where the words are used in the singular and
where they are used in the plural. If a question asks for
‘reasons’, one reason isn’t going to be enough. If it asks for
‘problems’, again one problem isn’t going to be adequate.
① read the questions carefully

③ use your experience and knowledge
