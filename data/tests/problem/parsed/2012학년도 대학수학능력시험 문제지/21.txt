Researchers studied two mobile phone companies trying 
to solve a technological problem. One company developed 
what it called a ‘technology shelf,’ created by a small group 
of engineers, on which ① was placed possible technical 
solutions that other teams might use in the future. It also 
created an open-ended conversation among ② its engineers 
in which salespeople and designers were often included. 
The boundaries among business units were deliberately 
ambiguous because more than technical information was 
needed ③ to get a feeling for the problem. However, the 
other company proceeded with more seeming clarity and 
discipline, ④ dividing the problem into its parts. Different 
departments protected their territory. Individuals and teams, 
competing with each other, stopped sharing information. 
The two companies did eventually ⑤ solve the technological 
problem, but the latter company had more difficulty than 
the former.
