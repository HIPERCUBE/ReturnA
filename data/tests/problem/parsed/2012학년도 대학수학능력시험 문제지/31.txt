The term euphemism derives from a Greek word meaning 
‘to speak with good words’ and involves substituting a 
more pleasant, less objectionable way of saying something 
for a blunt or more direct way. Why do people use 
euphemisms? They do so probably to help smooth out the 
‘rough edges’ of life, to make the unbearable bearable 
and the offensive inoffensive. (A) , euphemisms 
can become dangerous when they are used to create 
misperceptions of important issues. (B) , a politician 
may indicate that one of his statements was ‘somewhat at 
variance with the truth,’ meaning that he lied. Even more 
serious examples include describing rotting slums as 
‘substandard housing,’ making the miserable conditions 
appear reasonable and the need for action less important.
