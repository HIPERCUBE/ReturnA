Many people use their cleverness to justify and excuse 
themselves for the messiness of their workspaces. They 
say things like, “I know where everything is.” Or they 
say non-humorous things such as, “A clean desk is a 
sign of a sick mind.” However, people who say they 
know where everything is turn out to be using a large 
amount of their mental capacity and creative energies 
remembering where they placed things, rather than doing 
the job. If they worked in a well-organized environment 
for any length of time, they would be surprised at how 
much more productive they were. If you have a tendency 
to attempt to explain a messy desk or work area, challenge 
yourself to work with a clean desk for an entire day. 
The result will amaze you.
