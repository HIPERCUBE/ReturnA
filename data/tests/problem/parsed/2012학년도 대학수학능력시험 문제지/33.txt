33. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 
적절한 것은?
Even those of us who claim not to be materialistic 
can’t help but form attachments to certain clothes. Like 
fragments from old songs, clothes can (A) evoke / erase
both cherished and painful memories. A worn-thin dress 
may hang in the back of a closet even though it hasn’t 
been worn in years because the faint scent of pine that 
lingers on it is all that remains of someone’s sixteenth 
summer. A(n) (B) impractical / brand-new white scarf might 
be pulled out of a donation bag at the last minute because 
of the promise of elegance it once held for its owner. 
And a ripped T-shirt might be (C) rescued / forgotten  
from the dust rag bin long after the name of the rock 
band once written across it has faded. Clothes document 
personal history for us the same way that fossils chart 
time for archaeologists.
