34. Living things naturally return to a state of balance. 
When we are disturbed by forces acting on us, our inner 
machinery kicks in and returns us to a balanced state of 
equilibrium. Homeostasis is the word we use to describe 
the ability of an organism to maintain internal equilibrium 
by adjusting its physiological processes. Most of the 
systems in animal and human physiology are controlled 
by homeostasis. We don’t like to be off balance. We tend 
to keep things in a stable condition. This system operates 
at all levels. Our blood stays the same temperature. 
Except for extraordinary exceptions, when people find 
ways to intervene using methods more powerful than our 
tendency to equilibrium, our habits, behaviors, thoughts, 
and our quality of life stay pretty much the same too. 
① general tendency of organisms to keep equilibrium
② inner mechanisms to enhance the quality of life
③ physical balance needed for mental equilibrium
④ major differences in animal and human physiology
⑤ biological processes resulting from habitual behaviors
