(A)
When I was a freshman in high school, I won second 
prize in our local newspaper’s essay contest on the theme 
of ‘future career.’ I wrote about wanting to become a 
journalist. We had to collect our prizes at the local variety 
store and, while waiting in line, a little notebook in the 
stationery department caught my eye. (a) It was a black 
and red hardcover book with the word ‘Record’ neatly 
engraved in gold on the cover. I reasoned that since I 
was going to be a journalist, I’d need a very special 
notebook in which to write. So I bought (b) it.
(B)
Then during a serious illness when I was thirty-five, I 
found the little notebook I had purchased twenty years 
earlier. From my sick bed I noticed (c) it on a nearby 
shelf. It was still blank but something told me to write 
my deepest feelings and thoughts, my pain and fear, my 
wishes and dreams, the words of my inner world. This 
was my first ‘official’ journal. And the process of 
journal-keeping through writing and drawing helped heal 
me from a mysterious illness which had defied the 
doctors and their medicines.
(C)
My life changed so much after that. I began listening 
to my own feelings and inner wisdom. The insights I 
gained through journal-keeping led me into a new career 
as an art therapist and teacher of diary writing and drawing. 
More importantly, I learned to play and enjoy life again. 
For instance, several years after recovering from my 
illness, I started skateboarding for the first time in my 
life and loved (d) it. I’m grateful to that high school girl 
that I was for having the sense to buy a little blank 
book. I used it to save my life and to help others.
(D)
But I put the notebook away and promptly forgot about 
(e) it and about becoming a journalist. Painting became 
my great love. Upon graduating from high school, I went 
to college as a fine art major and English minor. After 
becoming a professional artist, marriage followed, then 
the birth of two daughters. A career change came next 
which led to teaching underprivileged young children in 
Los Angeles. The years passed.
