Mediation is a process that has much in common with 
advocacy but is also crucially different. It parallels 
advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of 
negotiation, but differs in so far as mediation involves 
adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties  
rather than taking up the case of one party against 
another. At times, particularly in very complex 
situations, the processes of advocacy and mediation can 
overlap, perhaps with very problematic results, as one 
loses clarity over his or her role. It is therefore 
important, if not essential, to maintain a clear focus in 
undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure 
that the roles do not become blurred and therefore 
potentially counterproductive. For example, a mediator 
who ‘takes sides’ is likely to lose all credibility, as is 
an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position.

① neutrality …… avoid

(A)
When I was a freshman in high school, I won second 
prize in our local newspaper’s essay contest on the theme 
of ‘future career.’ I wrote about wanting to become a 
journalist. We had to collect our prizes at the local variety 
store and, while waiting in line, a little notebook in the 
stationery department caught my eye. (a) It was a black 
and red hardcover book with the word ‘Record’ neatly 
engraved in gold on the cover. I reasoned that since I 
was going to be a journalist, I’d need a very special 
notebook in which to write. So I bought (b) it.
(B)
Then during a serious illness when I was thirty-five, I 
found the little notebook I had purchased twenty years 
earlier. From my sick bed I noticed (c) it on a nearby 
shelf. It was still blank but something told me to write 
my deepest feelings and thoughts, my pain and fear, my 
wishes and dreams, the words of my inner world. This 
was my first ‘official’ journal. And the process of 
journal-keeping through writing and drawing helped heal 
me from a mysterious illness which had defied the 
doctors and their medicines.
(C)
My life changed so much after that. I began listening 
to my own feelings and inner wisdom. The insights I 
gained through journal-keeping led me into a new career 
as an art therapist and teacher of diary writing and drawing. 
More importantly, I learned to play and enjoy life again. 
For instance, several years after recovering from my 
illness, I started skateboarding for the first time in my 
life and loved (d) it. I’m grateful to that high school girl 
that I was for having the sense to buy a little blank 
book. I used it to save my life and to help others.
(D)
But I put the notebook away and promptly forgot about 
(e) it and about becoming a journalist. Painting became 
my great love. Upon graduating from high school, I went 
to college as a fine art major and English minor. After 
becoming a professional artist, marriage followed, then 
the birth of two daughters. A career change came next 
which led to teaching underprivileged young children in 
Los Angeles. The years passed.

Since the beginning of time, the mysterious nature of 
dreaming has led people to believe that dreams were 
messages from the other world. Dreams have been regarded 
as prophetic communications which, when properly decoded, 
would enable us to foretell the future. There is, however, 
absolutely no scientific evidence for this theory. It is 
certainly true that individuals who are concerned about a 
traumatic event, such as the threat of the loss of a loved 
one who is sick, will dream about that loved one more 
than would otherwise be the case. If the dreamer then calls 
and finds that the loved one has died, it is understandable 
for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition 
of that death. But this is a mistake. It is simply a(n) 
correspondence between a situation about 
which one has intense concern and the occurrence of the 
event that one fears.
To prove the existence of premonitory dreams, scientific 
evidence must be obtained. We would need to do studies 
in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream 
life and judges are asked to make correspondences between 
these dream events and events that occurred in real life. A 
problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in 
premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples 
of ‘hits,’ but they never tell you how many of their 
premonitory dreams ‘missed.’ To do a scientific study of 
dream prophecy, we would need to establish some base of 
how commonly  correspondences occur between 
dream and waking reality. Until we have that evidence, 
it is better to believe that the assumption is false.
