During the 1997 Kyoto negotiations, Brazil made a 
suggestion that has since become known as the Brazilian 
Proposal. ① Its idea was that countries should now share 
the burden of emissions cuts according to how historically 
responsible they were for the problem. ② In other words, 
we should calculate what concentration of greenhouse 
gases each country has put into the atmosphere over time 
and use those figures to allocate emissions cuts. ③ That 
would mean, for instance, that countries such as Germany 
and the United Kingdom, which have been emitting for 
longer than most countries, would bear a larger share 
than their current emissions implied. ④ Greenhouse gases 
have been known to absorb heat and hold this heat in the 
atmosphere, instead of reflecting it back into space. ⑤ It 
would also mean that big emitters that had developed 
their industries more recently, such as Australia, would 
bear less of a share.
