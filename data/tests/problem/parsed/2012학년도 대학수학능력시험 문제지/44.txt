The DNA extracted from these bits of whale skin not 
only identifies the individuals in the group, but also 
reveals their relationships to each other. 
Sperm whales travel in social groups that cooperate to 
defend and protect each other, and may even share 
suckling of calves. ( ① ) It is difficult to determine the 
membership of these groups from sightings alone, because 
of the practical difficulties of observing whale behavior, 
most of which happens underwater. ( ② ) To make 
things even more difficult, sperm whales can travel across 
entire oceans and can dive to a depth of a kilometer.   
( ③ ) Biologists who study whale behavior generally 
have to be content with hanging around in boats, waiting 
for their subjects to surface. ( ④ ) But when they do 
surface, in addition to taking photos which allow 
individual whales to be identified, biologists can zip over 
in worryingly small boats and pick up the bits of skin 
that the whales leave behind on the surface when they 
re-submerge. ( ⑤ ) This has allowed researchers to 
describe sperm whale social groups in detail.
