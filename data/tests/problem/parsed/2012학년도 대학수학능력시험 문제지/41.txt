41. Emotional eaters manifest their problem in lots of 
different ways. For many people, one of the classic signs 
of emotional eating is night eating. Night eaters are often 
eating in response to anxiety or to the emotional turmoil 
they’ve experienced throughout the day. Boredom and 
loneliness are also more likely to come to the surface 
when the rush of the day is done and the night stretches 
ahead. Sometimes emotional eating is a reaction to a 
specific situation. You had a bad day at work. The kids 
have been so demanding that you are completely worn 
out. You and your significant other are fighting. It 
doesn’t matter what the circumstances are; the end result 
is that 99 times out of 100 you end up on the couch 
with a bowl of chips or bag of cookies in your hand, 
telling yourself it’s the only way you can relax.
