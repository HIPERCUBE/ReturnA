42. Giving people the latitude and flexibility to use their 
judgment and apply their talents rapidly accelerates 
progress. Send a message of respect and inspire people to 
be creative and use their individual talents toward the 
goals of the enterprise. Empower people by letting them 
know that you believe in them and allowing them to take 
action. Trusting people and empowering them also allows 
you to focus on the things you need to accomplish. Ellyn 
McColgan says, “I used to say to people all the time, ‘I 
can help you figure out just about any problem you 
throw at me, but is that really what you want from me?’ 
They would look at me funny and say, ‘Not really.’ I 
would say, ‘I think what you would like is to do a great 
job and then give me an opportunity to say, ‘Great job!’’ 
Then they would respond, ‘Yes, that’s true.’”
