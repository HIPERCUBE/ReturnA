shaped by the technological characteristics of the medium 
concerned. Access to TV sets and telephones is not the 
same as access to computers and networks.
(A) However, multi­functionality also results in extremely 
different applications, both advanced, with many 
opportunities to learn and build a career, and simple, 
mainly focused on entertainment. Other characteristics 
decreasing equality of access are the complexity, 
expensiveness and lack of user­friendliness of many 
contemporary new media.

they are multi­purpose or multi­functional technologies 
enabling all kinds of information, communication, transaction, 
work, education and entertainment.

more people gain access, the more valuable a connection 
becomes. [3점]
