When we examine individual behavior and the impact of 
perception on that behavior, it is important to remember 
that people see what they either want to see or are trained 
to see. (A) , in terms of human relations, the 
manager must try to understand the worker’s perception of 
reality. Employees willingly accept management’s methods 
only when they perceive those methods to be in the 
employees’ best interests. Otherwise, they will resort to 
such perceptual traps as selective perception and 
stereotyping. (B) , Harvey Lester, a new employee, 
has been having trouble mastering his new job. His boss, 
Lois, tells him that if he does not improve, she will have 
to let him go. Feeling that he is on the verge of being

designed to improve output is interpreted as a threat 
resulting in a resignation. Each party interpreted the action 
differently.
