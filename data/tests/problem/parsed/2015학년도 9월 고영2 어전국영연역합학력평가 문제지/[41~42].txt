Like few other institutions in American life, baseball, 
football, basketball, and hockey are a source of social glue 
and civic pride. From Yankee Stadium in New York to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco, sports stadiums are the 
cathedrals of our civil religion, public spaces that gather 
people from different walks of life in rituals of loss and hope. 
But professional sports is not only a source of civic 
identity. It is also a business. And in recent decades, the 
money in sports has been crowding out the community. It 
would be an exaggeration to say that naming rights and 
corporate sponsorships have ruined the experience of 
rooting for the home team. Still, changing the name of a 
civic landmark changes its meaning. This is one reason 
why Detroit fans mourned when Tiger Stadium, named for 
the team, gave way to Comerica Park, named for a bank.
When fans go to the ballpark or arena, they don’t go 
primarily for the sake of a civic experience. They go to see 
David Ortiz hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth, or to 
see Tom Brady throw a touchdown pass in the final seconds 
of the game. But the         character of the setting 
conveys a civic teaching ―that we are all in this together, 
that for a few hours at least, we share a sense of place and 
civic pride. As stadiums become less like landmarks and 
more like billboards, the social bonds and civic sentiments 
they inspire fade.
