In a crowded world, an unmanaged commons cannot 
possibly work. That is an important qualification. If the 
world is not crowded, a commons may in fact be the 
best method of distribution. 
(A) A plainsman could kill an American bison, cut out only 
the tongue for his dinner, and discard the rest of the 
animal. He was not being wasteful in any important 
sense. Nor did it much matter how a lonely American 
frontiersman disposed of his waste. 
(B) For example, when the pioneers spread out across the 
United States, the most efficient way was to treat all 
the game in the wild as an unmanaged commons because 
for a long time humans couldn’t do any real damage. 
(C) Today, with only a few thousand bison left, we would 
be outraged by such careless behavior. As the 
population in the United States became denser, the 
land’s natural chemical and biological recycling processes 
were overloaded. Careful management of these resources 
became necessary, from bison to oil and water.
