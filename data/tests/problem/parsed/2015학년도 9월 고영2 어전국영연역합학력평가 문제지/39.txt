The old idea of innate intelligence has had a major effect 
on this categorizing and labelling of children.
In the last twenty years or so research on the brain has 
radically changed the way intelligence is understood. There 
is now considerable controversy surrounding the notion of 
general intelligence. ( ① ) Some of our intelligence may 
indeed be inherited, but our life experience is now thought 
to have a profound effect upon intelligence. ( ② ) Scientists 
have suggested that intelligence changes and modifies as one 
progresses through life. ( ③ ) This finding has not yet 
impacted on schooling in any significant way. ( ④ ) When 
asked to describe a class they had met for the first time, 
some teachers immediately divided the children into three 
groups, the bright, the middle­of­the­road and the “no 
hopers.” ( ⑤ ) It has contributed to many children growing 
up with the mistaken idea that they are not intelligent and 
cannot succeed in education.
