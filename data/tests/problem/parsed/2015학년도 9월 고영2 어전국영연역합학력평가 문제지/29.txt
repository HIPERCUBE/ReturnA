Many times I have noticed coaches and parents choose the 
wrong time to explain concepts to children. A perfect example 
of this is while the children are playing a game. As a coach, 
the only time I would talk strategy was during a time­out or 
after the game. This is because it is really difficult for 
children to play and listen at the same time. I would only say 
words of encouragement while the children were playing. You 
might have seen a father watching his son playing a game in a 
field, yelling at him to point out his errors. The game 
continues to be played while the child is trying to pay 
attention to what his father is telling him. Children need to be 
able to concentrate on the task at hand. Children can play, or 
they can listen, but like adults, it’s almost impossible for them 
to do both at once.
