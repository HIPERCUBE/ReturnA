적절한 것은? [3점]
The best thing I did as a manager was to make every 
person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. 
I had started doing this just to simplify the task of 
managing people. But then I noticed a deeper result: 
defining roles (A) increased / reduced  conflict. Most fights 
inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the 
same responsibilities. Startup companies face an especially 
high risk of this since job roles are (B) fluid / solid  at the 
early stages. Eliminating competition makes it easier for 
everyone to build the kinds of long­term relationships that 
transcend mere professionalism. More than that, internal 
peace is what enables a startup to survive at all. When a 
startup fails, we often imagine it surrendering to predatory 
rivals in a competitive ecosystem. But every company is 
also its own ecosystem, and internal conflict makes it  
(C) immune / vulnerable  to outside threats.
* transcend: 초월하다
