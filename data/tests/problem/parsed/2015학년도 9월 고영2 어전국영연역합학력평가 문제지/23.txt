The first humans who figured out how to write things 
down around 5,000 years ago were in essence trying to 
increase the capacity of their hippocampus, part of the 
brain’s memory system. They effectively extended the 
natural limits of human memory by preserving some of their 
memories on clay tablets and cave walls, and later, papyrus 
and parchment. Later, we developed other mechanisms ―
such as calendars, filing cabinets, computers, and 
smartphones ― to help us organize and store the information 
we’ve written down. When our computer or smartphone 
starts to run slowly, we might buy a larger memory card. 
That memory is both a metaphor and a physical reality. We 
are off­loading a great deal of the processing that our 
neurons would normally do to an external device that then 
becomes an extension of our own brains, a neural enhancer.
