25. Brooks Stevens에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Brooks Stevens was born in 1911 in Milwaukee. When he 
was struck down with polio at 8, his limbs stiffened and his 
right arm became virtually useless. Doctors predicted that he 
would not be able to walk again. Stevens’ father, however, 
was not a believer in bed rest. He piled sketchpads and model 
kits next to the boy’s bed and encouraged him to build 
miniature airplanes and boats. Stevens enrolled at Cornell 
University to study architecture but left Cornell without a 
diploma. Later, he returned to Milwaukee to work as an 
inventory manager. Bored and restless, he persuaded the head 
of his company to let him redesign some of the product labels. 
This opportunity was the first step towards Stevens’ career as 
an industrial designer. He opened his first office in 1935 and 
later created his own Auto Museum, which displayed both 
vehicles of his own design and those that he admired.
