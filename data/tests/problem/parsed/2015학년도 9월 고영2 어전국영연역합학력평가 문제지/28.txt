The ability to think about why things work and what may 
be causing problems when events do not go as ① expected 
seems like an obvious aspect of the way we think. It is 
interesting that this ability to think about why things happen 
is one of the key abilities that separates human abilities from 
②those of just about every other animal on the planet. 
Asking why allows people to create explanations. Issac 
Newton didn’t just see an apple ③ fall from a tree. He used 
that observation to help him figure out why it fell. Your car 
mechanic doesn’t just observe ④ that your car is not working. 
He figures out why it is not working using knowledge about 
why it usually does work properly. And anyone who has 
spent time with a five­year­old ⑤ knowing that children this 
age can test the limits of your patience by trying to get 
explanations for why everything works as it does.
