(A)
In Mesa, I met a woman named Mazi, who shared her story. 
In 1979, Mazi was living with her son and her mother in 
Ajmer. Many dogs roamed the streets in Ajmer, and that 
summer Mazi befriended one. Every day a little brown dog 
came to her home, searching for food and shelter from the hot 
sun. Mazi looked forward to the visits, especially when (a) she 
noticed the dog’s belly swelling with a litter of puppies. With 
the monsoon season approaching, Mazi, like everyone else in 
Ajmer, prepared for two to three months of intensified rainfall.
(B)
And then, (b) she turned around and repeated the 
whole exhausting effort in reverse: back to the door, 
through the house, and up to the roof, while holding the 
dog above the water. “I continue to be amazed at the 
enormous physical strength and strength of purpose that 
filled me that day,” Mazi stressed, “especially since I 
didn’t know how to swim! But, I loved that little dog. I 
was so afraid (c) she would be swept away before I could 
reach her! Since then I have known: I have strength!”
(C)
Strength emerged in the form of determination, and it 
rose within Mazi like the water rising around her. 
Without hesitation, she worked her way down the stairs 
and through the house. Pushing through chest­high water, 
hardly able to see in the darkness, Mazi finally reached 
the front door. There, with a mixture of resolve and 
physical strength, (d) she forced the door open and 
pressed on through the floodwater to the wall. Despite 
the pressure of the water, Mazi stood steadily and lifted 
the dog from the wall. 
(D)
That summer, the rains were heavy. On July 19, when the 
water reached flood proportions, Mazi, her son, and her mom 
climbed the stairs of their one­story home to the rooftop. As 
the sky darkened and the rain poured, they watched as cattle 
and furniture rushed by in a massive, muddy river. “Suddenly, 
I noticed a dog ―that dog ―standing dangerously on the wall 
surrounding our house. It was as if my heart burst open,” 
(e) she said. “I had to save her.”
