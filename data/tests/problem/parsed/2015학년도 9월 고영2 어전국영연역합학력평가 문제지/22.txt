Anxiety has been around for thousands of years. 
According to evolutionary psychologists, it is adaptive to 
the extent that it helped our ancestors avoid situations in 
which the margin of error between life and death was slim. 
Anxiety warned people when their lives were in danger: not 
only from wild tigers, cave bears, hungry hyenas, and other 
animals stalking the landscape, but also from hostile, 
competing tribes. Being on alert helped ancient people fight 
predators, flee from enemies, or “freeze,” blending in, as if 
camouflaged, so they wouldn’t be noticed. It mobilized them 
to react to real threats to their survival. It pushed them 
into keeping their children out of harm’s way. Anxiety thus 
persisted through evolution in a majority of the population 
because it was (and can be) an advantageous, life­saving 
trait.
