Whenever you find yourself reacting differently than you 
would if you had unlimited time, you’re acting out of 
neediness and won’t be reading people clearly. Stop and 
consider alternative courses of action before you go forward. 
It’s often best to find a temporary solution to begin with, 
and decide on a permanent one later. The parents urgently 
seeking child care could put their immediate efforts into 
convincing a friend or family member to help out for a week 
or two, buying them time to look for permanent help. If they 
can afford it, they can hire a professional nanny for a while. 
Temporary solutions may be more expensive or inconvenient in 
the short run, but they’ll give you the time you need to make 
a wise choice about your long­term selection.
