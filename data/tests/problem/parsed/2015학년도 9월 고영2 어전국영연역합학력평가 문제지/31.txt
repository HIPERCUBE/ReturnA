31. John Wooden, the great UCLA basketball coach who 
produced 10 NCAA championship teams in 12 years during 
the 1960s and 1970s, perfectly exemplified the power of    
. In the fascinating film documentary The 
UCLA Dynasty, one player recalled, “There was a way to 
do everything. You could have taken UCLA people who 
played in 1955, 1965, 1970, and 1975; put them on the 
same team; and they would have been able to play with 
each other, instantly.” Wooden ran his drills with rare 
modifications over the course of three decades. Drills would 
start and end like clockwork, the same drills performed 
before the national championship as at the beginning of the 
season so that, in the words of a star player, “By the time 
the games came along, they just became memorized 
exhibitions of brilliance.” [3점]
