18. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Whenever you find yourself reacting differently than you 
would if you had unlimited time, you’re acting out of 
neediness and won’t be reading people clearly. Stop and 
consider alternative courses of action before you go forward. 
It’s often best to find a temporary solution to begin with, 
and decide on a permanent one later. The parents urgently 
seeking child care could put their immediate efforts into 
convincing a friend or family member to help out for a week 
or two, buying them time to look for permanent help. If they 
can afford it, they can hire a professional nanny for a while. 
Temporary solutions may be more expensive or inconvenient in 
the short run, but they’ll give you the time you need to make 
a wise choice about your long­term selection. 
① 시급한 상황일수록 원칙에 따라 행동하라.
② 집단의 성공을 위해 개인의 불편을 감수하라.
③ 자신의 능력에 맞는 단기적 목표를 수립하라.
④ 의사 결정 시 시간과 비용을 최우선으로 고려하라.
⑤ 임시방편을 통해 현명한 선택을 할 시간을 확보하라.
19. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘She’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
She just couldn’t take her eyes off it. Nor, for that 
matter, could she wait to try it on. Quickly she slipped off 
her own plain red coat. She was breathing fast now, she 
couldn’t help it, and her eyes were stretched very wide. 
But, the feel of that fur! The great black coat seemed to 
slide onto her almost by itself, like a second skin. It was 
the strangest feeling! She looked into the mirror. She looked 
wonderful, beautiful, and rich, all at the same time. And the 
sense of power that it gave her! In this coat she could walk 
into any place she wanted and people would come running 
around her like rabbits. The whole thing was just too 
wonderful for words! 
① delighted and excited ② calm and relieved
③ envious and irritated ④ disappointed and angry
⑤ ashamed and embarrassed

The running boy was way ahead of him, but Roy figured 
① he could stay close enough to keep him in sight. He 
knew the kid couldn’t go at full speed forever. ② He 
followed him for several blocks ― over fences, through 
shrubbery, weaving through barking dogs and lawn 
sprinklers. Eventually Roy felt himself tiring. This kid is 
amazing, ③ he thought. Maybe he’s practicing for the track 
team. Once Roy thought he saw the boy glance over ④ his 
shoulder, as if he knew he was being pursued, but Roy 
couldn’t be certain. The boy was still far ahead of him, and 
Roy was gulping like a beached trout. His shirt was soaked 
and sweat poured off ⑤ his forehead, stinging his eyes.

22. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Anxiety has been around for thousands of years. 
According to evolutionary psychologists, it is adaptive to 
the extent that it helped our ancestors avoid situations in 
which the margin of error between life and death was slim. 
Anxiety warned people when their lives were in danger: not 
only from wild tigers, cave bears, hungry hyenas, and other 
animals stalking the landscape, but also from hostile, 
competing tribes. Being on alert helped ancient people fight 
predators, flee from enemies, or “freeze,” blending in, as if 
camouflaged, so they wouldn’t be noticed. It mobilized them 
to react to real threats to their survival. It pushed them 
into keeping their children out of harm’s way. Anxiety thus 
persisted through evolution in a majority of the population 
because it was (and can be) an advantageous, life­saving 
trait.                        
* camouflaged: 위장한
① Don’t Be Anxious, Just Be Ready!
② How Anxiety Helped Us to Survive
③ Living Simply in an Anxious World
④ Humans and Animals: Friends or Enemies? 
⑤ Various Emotions: the Products of Evolution
23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
The first humans who figured out how to write things 
down around 5,000 years ago were in essence trying to 
increase the capacity of their hippocampus, part of the 
brain’s memory system. They effectively extended the 
natural limits of human memory by preserving some of their 
memories on clay tablets and cave walls, and later, papyrus 
and parchment. Later, we developed other mechanisms ―
such as calendars, filing cabinets, computers, and 
smartphones ― to help us organize and store the information 
we’ve written down. When our computer or smartphone 
starts to run slowly, we might buy a larger memory card. 
That memory is both a metaphor and a physical reality. We 
are off­loading a great deal of the processing that our 
neurons would normally do to an external device that then 
becomes an extension of our own brains, a neural enhancer.
* parchment: 양피지
① ways of preserving written documents
② human efforts to extend the memory capacity
③ reasons to be independent of smart technology
④ necessity of brain exercises for mental strength 
⑤ rapid enhancement of the brain’s multitasking ability

The graph above shows the U.S. population’s average 
daily consumption of calories from sugar drinks from 2005 
to 2008. ① In each age group, consumption of calories from 
sugar drinks is higher in males than females. ② In both 
genders, consumption of calories from sugar drinks 
increases until ages 12­19 and then decreases with age.   
③ Consumption of calories of males never falls below 70 
kcal while that of females falls to 42 kcal in ages 60 and 
over. ④ The highest consumption of calories from sugar 
drinks is more than four times as much as the lowest 
consumption in each gender, respectively. ⑤ The gap 
between males’ and females’ consumption of calories from 
sugar drinks is the smallest among the group aged 2­5.
25. Brooks Stevens에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Brooks Stevens was born in 1911 in Milwaukee. When he 
was struck down with polio at 8, his limbs stiffened and his 
right arm became virtually useless. Doctors predicted that he 
would not be able to walk again. Stevens’ father, however, 
was not a believer in bed rest. He piled sketchpads and model 
kits next to the boy’s bed and encouraged him to build 
miniature airplanes and boats. Stevens enrolled at Cornell 
University to study architecture but left Cornell without a 
diploma. Later, he returned to Milwaukee to work as an 
inventory manager. Bored and restless, he persuaded the head 
of his company to let him redesign some of the product labels. 
This opportunity was the first step towards Stevens’ career as 
an industrial designer. He opened his first office in 1935 and 
later created his own Auto Museum, which displayed both 
vehicles of his own design and those that he admired.
* polio: 소아마비
① 여덟 살 때 병을 앓아 오른팔을 거의 쓸 수 없게 되었다.

The ability to think about why things work and what may 
be causing problems when events do not go as ① expected 
seems like an obvious aspect of the way we think. It is 
interesting that this ability to think about why things happen 
is one of the key abilities that separates human abilities from 
②those of just about every other animal on the planet. 
Asking why allows people to create explanations. Issac 
Newton didn’t just see an apple ③ fall from a tree. He used 
that observation to help him figure out why it fell. Your car 
mechanic doesn’t just observe ④ that your car is not working. 
He figures out why it is not working using knowledge about 
why it usually does work properly. And anyone who has 
spent time with a five­year­old ⑤ knowing that children this 
age can test the limits of your patience by trying to get 
explanations for why everything works as it does. 


33. What distinguishes recycling is not its importance, but 
rather the ease with which individuals can participate, and 
the visibility of actions taken to promote the common good. 
You may care passionately about the threat of global 
warming or the destruction of the rain forests ― but you 
can’t have an immediate effect on these problems that is 
perceptible to yourself or others. The rain forest salvation 
truck doesn’t make weekly pickups, let alone the clean air 
truck. When a public opinion poll in 1990 asked people 
what they had done in connection with environmental 
problems, 80 to 85% answered that they or their 
households had participated in various aspects of recycling; 
no other significant steps had been taken by a majority of 
respondents. Like the drunk looking for his wallet under

When we examine individual behavior and the impact of 
perception on that behavior, it is important to remember 
that people see what they either want to see or are trained 
to see. (A) , in terms of human relations, the 
manager must try to understand the worker’s perception of 
reality. Employees willingly accept management’s methods 
only when they perceive those methods to be in the 
employees’ best interests. Otherwise, they will resort to 
such perceptual traps as selective perception and 
stereotyping. (B) , Harvey Lester, a new employee, 
has been having trouble mastering his new job. His boss, 
Lois, tells him that if he does not improve, she will have 
to let him go. Feeling that he is on the verge of being 
fired, Harvey quits. What Lois saw as a mild warning 
designed to improve output is interpreted as a threat 
resulting in a resignation. Each party interpreted the action 
differently.

It is impossible to imagine a modern city without glass. 
① On the one hand, we expect our buildings to protect 
us from the weather: this is what they are for, after all. 
② And yet, faced with a prospective new home or place of 
work, one of the first questions people ask is: how much 
natural light is there? ③ The glass buildings that rise every 
day in a modern city are the engineering answer to these 
conflicting desires: to be at once sheltered from the wind, 
the cold, and the rain, to be secure from intrusion and 
thieves, but not to live in darkness. ④ Although glass is an 
affordable building material, glass engineering is expensive, 
causing the glass building market to be exclusive. ⑤ The 
l if e  we lead indoors, which for many of us is the vast majority of our time, is made light and delightful by glass.

The potential of access to a particular medium is 
shaped by the technological characteristics of the medium 
concerned. Access to TV sets and telephones is not the 
same as access to computers and networks.
(A) However, multi­functionality also results in extremely 
different applications, both advanced, with many 
opportunities to learn and build a career, and simple, 
mainly focused on entertainment. Other characteristics 
decreasing equality of access are the complexity, 
expensiveness and lack of user­friendliness of many 
contemporary new media.
(B) All media have characteristics supporting and discouraging 
access. Computers and their networks support access because 
they are multi­purpose or multi­functional technologies 
enabling all kinds of information, communication, transaction, 
work, education and entertainment.
(C) So, there are useful applications for everybody. Moreover, 
the extension of networks produces network effects: the 
more people gain access, the more valuable a connection 
becomes. [3점]

In a crowded world, an unmanaged commons cannot 
possibly work. That is an important qualification. If the 
world is not crowded, a commons may in fact be the 
best method of distribution. 
(A) A plainsman could kill an American bison, cut out only 
the tongue for his dinner, and discard the rest of the 
animal. He was not being wasteful in any important 
sense. Nor did it much matter how a lonely American 
frontiersman disposed of his waste. 
(B) For example, when the pioneers spread out across the 
United States, the most efficient way was to treat all 
the game in the wild as an unmanaged commons because 
for a long time humans couldn’t do any real damage. 
(C) Today, with only a few thousand bison left, we would 
be outraged by such careless behavior. As the 
population in the United States became denser, the 
land’s natural chemical and biological recycling processes 
were overloaded. Careful management of these resources 
became necessary, from bison to oil and water.

In desperation, many Irish farmers resorted to cultivating 
wetlands or rocky hillsides.

The Irish overreliance on potatoes was worsened by certain 
economic trends in the early 19th century. ( ① ) The 
development of the British textile industry, for example, 
made the traditional handicraft sector useless, destroying a 
key mechanism for achieving food security for the Irish 
rural poor. ( ② ) A second negative trend was falling real 
wages and rising rents, which gradually reduced the relative 
standard of living of wage­dependent Irish. ( ③ ) But this 
unproductive land left such farmers at a chronic risk of 
starvation. ( ④ ) Another sign of Irish poverty was the 
increased reliance of the poor on the “lumper” variety of 
potato, a watery, tasteless potato that nonetheless could 
produce impressive yields even on substandard soil. ( ⑤ ) 
Unfortunately this potato proved particularly vulnerable to 
the potato blight of 1845­52.

The old idea of innate intelligence has had a major effect 
on this categorizing and labelling of children.
In the last twenty years or so research on the brain has 
radically changed the way intelligence is understood. There 
is now considerable controversy surrounding the notion of 
general intelligence. ( ① ) Some of our intelligence may 
indeed be inherited, but our life experience is now thought 
to have a profound effect upon intelligence. ( ② ) Scientists 
have suggested that intelligence changes and modifies as one 
progresses through life. ( ③ ) This finding has not yet 
impacted on schooling in any significant way. ( ④ ) When 
asked to describe a class they had met for the first time, 
some teachers immediately divided the children into three 
groups, the bright, the middle­of­the­road and the “no 
hopers.” ( ⑤ ) It has contributed to many children growing 
up with the mistaken idea that they are not intelligent and 
cannot succeed in education.

(B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?  Research by Paul Slovic of Decision Research and the 
University of Oregon shows that people who are otherwise 
caring and would go out of their way to help another 
individual become indifferent to the suffering of the 
masses. In one experiment, people were given $5 to 
donate to lessen hunger overseas. The first choice was to 
give the money to a particular child, Rokia, a 
seven­year­old in Mali. The second choice was to help 
twenty­one million hungry Africans. The third choice was 
to help Rokia, but as just one of many victims of hunger. 
Can you guess which choice was most popular? Slovic 
reported that donations to the individual, Rokia, were far 
greater than donations to the second choice, the statistical 
portrayal of the hunger crisis. That’s not particularly 
surprising. But what is surprising, and some would say 
discouraging, is that adding the statistical realities of the 
larger hunger problem to Rokia’s story significantly 
reduced the contributions to Rokia.

Like few other institutions in American life, baseball, 
football, basketball, and hockey are a source of social glue 
and civic pride. From Yankee Stadium in New York to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco, sports stadiums are the 
cathedrals of our civil religion, public spaces that gather 
people from different walks of life in rituals of loss and hope. 
But professional sports is not only a source of civic 
identity. It is also a business. And in recent decades, the 
money in sports has been crowding out the community. It 
would be an exaggeration to say that naming rights and 
corporate sponsorships have ruined the experience of 
rooting for the home team. Still, changing the name of a 
civic landmark changes its meaning. This is one reason 
why Detroit fans mourned when Tiger Stadium, named for 
the team, gave way to Comerica Park, named for a bank.
When fans go to the ballpark or arena, they don’t go 
primarily for the sake of a civic experience. They go to see 
David Ortiz hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth, or to 
see Tom Brady throw a touchdown pass in the final seconds 
of the game. But the         character of the setting 
conveys a civic teaching ―that we are all in this together, 
that for a few hours at least, we share a sense of place and 
civic pride. As stadiums become less like landmarks and 
more like billboards, the social bonds and civic sentiments 
they inspire fade.

In Mesa, I met a woman named Mazi, who shared her story. 
In 1979, Mazi was living with her son and her mother in 
Ajmer. Many dogs roamed the streets in Ajmer, and that 
summer Mazi befriended one. Every day a little brown dog 
came to her home, searching for food and shelter from the hot 
sun. Mazi looked forward to the visits, especially when (a) she 
noticed the dog’s belly swelling with a litter of puppies. With 
the monsoon season approaching, Mazi, like everyone else in 
Ajmer, prepared for two to three months of intensified rainfall.
(B)
And then, (b) she turned around and repeated the 
whole exhausting effort in reverse: back to the door, 
through the house, and up to the roof, while holding the 
dog above the water. “I continue to be amazed at the 
enormous physical strength and strength of purpose that 
filled me that day,” Mazi stressed, “especially since I 
didn’t know how to swim! But, I loved that little dog. I 
was so afraid (c) she would be swept away before I could 
reach her! Since then I have known: I have strength!”
(C)
Strength emerged in the form of determination, and it 
rose within Mazi like the water rising around her. 
Without hesitation, she worked her way down the stairs 
and through the house. Pushing through chest­high water, 
hardly able to see in the darkness, Mazi finally reached 
the front door. There, with a mixture of resolve and 
physical strength, (d) she forced the door open and 
pressed on through the floodwater to the wall. Despite 
the pressure of the water, Mazi stood steadily and lifted 
the dog from the wall. 
(D)
That summer, the rains were heavy. On July 19, when the 
water reached flood proportions, Mazi, her son, and her mom 
climbed the stairs of their one­story home to the rooftop. As 
the sky darkened and the rain poured, they watched as cattle 
and furniture rushed by in a massive, muddy river. “Suddenly, 
I noticed a dog ―that dog ―standing dangerously on the wall 
surrounding our house. It was as if my heart burst open,” 
(e) she said. “I had to save her.”
