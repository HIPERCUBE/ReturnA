(B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?  Research by Paul Slovic of Decision Research and the 
University of Oregon shows that people who are otherwise 
caring and would go out of their way to help another 
individual become indifferent to the suffering of the 
masses. In one experiment, people were given $5 to 
donate to lessen hunger overseas. The first choice was to 
give the money to a particular child, Rokia, a 
seven­year­old in Mali. The second choice was to help 
twenty­one million hungry Africans. The third choice was 
to help Rokia, but as just one of many victims of hunger. 
Can you guess which choice was most popular? Slovic 
reported that donations to the individual, Rokia, were far 
greater than donations to the second choice, the statistical 
portrayal of the hunger crisis. That’s not particularly 
surprising. But what is surprising, and some would say 
discouraging, is that adding the statistical realities of the 
larger hunger problem to Rokia’s story significantly 
reduced the contributions to Rokia.
