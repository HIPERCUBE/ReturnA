daily consumption of calories from sugar drinks from 2005 
to 2008. ① In each age group, consumption of calories from

③ Consumption of calories of males never falls below 70 
kcal while that of females falls to 42 kcal in ages 60 and 
over. ④ The highest consumption of calories from sugar 
drinks is more than four times as much as the lowest 
consumption in each gender, respectively. ⑤ The gap 
between males’ and females’ consumption of calories from 
sugar drinks is the smallest among the group aged 2­5.
