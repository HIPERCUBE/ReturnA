“Aerobic” means “with oxygen.” It’s not surprising that 
the demands you make on your body when you ask it to 
sustain an aerobic activity train your lungs to deliver 
oxygen and your heart ① to pump out greater amounts of 
blood to carry that oxygen to your working muscles. 
Your body also responds to this challenge by producing 
and storing something ② referred to as aerobic enzymes. 
These enzymes help you burn more fat, which is another 
reason why aerobic exercise has ③ such a pronounced 
effect on your body fat. This effect, which is often 
overlooked, is a primary reason why people ④ do aerobic 
exercises establish a new metabolism and a leaner body. 
Yet another benefit of aerobic training is ⑤ that it 
enables your muscles to better use oxygen to perform 
work over extended periods of time.
