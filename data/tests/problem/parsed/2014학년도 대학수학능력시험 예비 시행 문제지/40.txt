Classification allows us to focus on one or two features 
and see something in terms of those characteristics alone. 
To classify plants and animals, we have to ignore all the 
variations that distinguish one plant from another and 
one animal from another. We have to focus only on 
those aspects that are shared by all plants and that 
differentiate them from all animals. We ignore the great 
variation that exists within each group and reduce its 
members to the common ground that ties all the 
members of that group together. As a result, we come to 
see objects in terms of their membership in a particular 
group, and we miss seeing that each is more than its 
group membership. Trapped by the category of doors, we 
become blind to the three-by-seven-foot pieces of wood 
that are right in front of us.
