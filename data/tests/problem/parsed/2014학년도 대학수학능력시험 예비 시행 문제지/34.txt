34. A good place for business leaders to start the process 
of building trust is by becoming more            to 
their employees. Getting out of the office and mixing 
with employees is a simple solution to a very common 
trust problem. In organizational improvement workshops, 
we often ask, “What is the single greatest barrier to 
improving communication and trust between you and your 
manager?” In many cases, the first response is, “I never 
see her. She’s always in a meeting.” The employees 
cannot develop a perception of trust with higher-ups 
when some don’t even know what they look like. If 
leaders seldom come out of the office, choosing to 
communicate through email instead, they are no longer a 
part of that organization. [3점]
