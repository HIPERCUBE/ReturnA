34. As they try to maneuver through times of guilt and 
austerity, marketers seek tactics that they hope will 
overcome consumers’ guilt and negative self-regard― and 
will as a result revive consumption. New research on 
consumer behavior suggests that an effective tactic can 
be to acknowledge consumers’ unconscious attempts 
. Research has shown that 
people engage in compensatory behavior when their 
self-image deviates from its standard level. In other words, 
when a person’s self-image dips, the individual tries to 
compensate for this negative self-regard by, for example, 
refraining from purchasing or consuming a guilty pleasure.

standard level, the individual is inclined to give in to 
behaviors that are otherwise associated with feelings of 
guilt.  [3점]
