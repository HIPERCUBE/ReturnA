Color adds beauty to our lives, but it does more than that. 
Color serves important signaling functions, both natural and 
contrived by humans. The natural and human-made world 
provides many color signals that help us identify things. I

color helps facilitate perceptual organization, the process by 
which small elements become grouped perceptually into 
larger objects. Color perception greatly facilitates the ability 
to tell one object from another and especially to pick out 
objects within scenes, an ability crucial to the survival of 
many species. (B) , consider a monkey searching 
for fruit in the forest. A monkey with good color vision 
easily detects red fruit against a green background, but a 
color-blind monkey would find it more difficult to find the 
fruit. Color vision thus enhances the contrast of objects that, 
if they didn’t appear colored, would appear more similar.
