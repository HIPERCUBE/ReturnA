26. 밑줄 친 she[her]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? 
Sarah kept walking until a combination of curiosity and 
hunger drove ① her into an old convenience store. 
Pushing open its glass door, ② she was sucked once 
again into that other, earlier time. The storekeeper, the 
only other occupant of the place, was a wrinkled old 
woman in a faded lavender-print dress. She didn’t bother 
greeting Sarah but continued to sit motionless, conserving 
③ her energy as she watched a collection of counter 
goods that might have sprung straight out of Sarah’s 
childhood. A price list stuck up crooked beside the candy 
told her ④ she could buy half a loaf of oversweetened 
white bread, if she wanted, or a scoop of frozen peas. 
There was nothing here that Sarah felt like eating. She 
nodded at the woman, who once again failed to 
acknowledge ⑤ her, and left the shop.
