(A)
About eight years ago storyteller Melissa Heckler 
arrived at a school ready to tell a few tales. Her 
classroom audience included children at risk because of 
learning difficulties, poverty, and other problems. The 
school suggested that Heckler not tell any family stories, 
assuming that the last thing such kids wanted to hear or 
talk about was family life. So (a) she told the students 
folk tales. “To everyone’s surprise, the kids who were 
most at risk were the most responsive,” says Heckler. 
“They used the stories as a mask― as a way to tell 
their own secrets.”
(B)
Heckler also asks the kids to collect stories from 
family members and friends. To make telling those 
stories a playful activity during class, (b) she sometimes 
has the children present their stories as if they were 
doing a radio program, complete with a student 
moderator and guest appearances by student storytellers. 
Or they might act out a TV show and tell the tales to a 
video camera. Other times the kids simply share the 
stories with their classmates. 
(C)
Regardless of how the stories are staged, the children 
continually surprise Heckler with their honesty and their 
revelations. “One girl’s father was a firefighter,” remembers 
Heckler, “and she told a story about her father’s being 
injured on the job. When the girl told the story, she 
showed so much dignity, and from that day, the other 
kids treated (c) her differently, more kindly. Telling their 
own stories gives them a chance to express their heart 
and their strengths. They begin to see their own 
richness.”
(D)
Heckler’s repertoire does not stop with folk tales. (d) She 
also uses personal stories, her own and the children’s, to 
draw the kids out. She may have the children ask her 
questions, or (e) she may simply tell a tale about herself. 
“It doesn’t matter whether you’ve had a rough life or a 
privileged one. What matters is that you’re telling them 
your story,” explains Heckler. “They have to sense that 
what you’re telling them is real. They need to see you as 
a person. That will help them open up and tell their 
stories.”
