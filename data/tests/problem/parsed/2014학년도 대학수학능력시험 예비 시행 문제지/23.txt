One of the rules for success is that it doesn’t matter 
where you’re coming from; all that matters is where 
you’re going. Almost everyone has the uneasy feeling 
that they have wasted a good deal of their time and their 
potential in the past. Unfortunately, many people use 
these feelings of regret as brakes that they set on their 
own lives. Instead of rededicating themselves to the 
exciting months and years ahead, they allow themselves 
to be overwhelmed with the mistakes that they made in 
the past. Don’t let this happen to you. Instead, think 
about the future and where you are going. Think about 
what you can do to create the kind of future you 
imagine for yourself. Your resolve to be future-oriented 
will give you energy and enthusiasm. And your future is 
limited only by your imagination.
