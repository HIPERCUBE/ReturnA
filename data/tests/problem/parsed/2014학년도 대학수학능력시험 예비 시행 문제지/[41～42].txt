Before 1969, a watch was just a watch. There were 
manual and automatic-winding watches, calendar 
watches, and many other types of watches. All were 
powered by mechanical-movement systems, and accuracy 
was of the utmost importance. In 1969, quartz watches 
were introduced. They were much more accurate than 
previous watches― and much cheaper. Within a decade 
of their introduction, quartz watches dominated the 
industry. Mechanical watch makers faced two obvious 
but unattractive options: Attempt a highly uncertain 
transition to produce quartz movement or redouble 
efforts to improve the price and performance of their 
mechanical-movement devices, thereby merely narrowing, 
but not closing, the performance gap with quartz.
Insightful firms, however, recognized a third option. 
They realized that the rise of the quartz watch meant that 
for the first time, consumers could choose between 
mechanical and nonmechanical watches. In other words, 
the introduction of nonmechanical watches made some 
consumers aware of their preference for “mechanicalness.” 
These watchmakers began their products 
with this type of consumer in mind. One result was a shift 
from the industry norm of hiding watch mechanisms 
within the case to making parts visible in order to show 
off the increasingly complicated, visually stimulating 
mechanical movements.
Clearly, the niche of consumers who valued the mechanical 
quality of a watch was smaller than the larger watch 
market. However, these consumers were willing to pay a 
higher price. And perhaps more important, this niche was 
immune to attack from quartz watchmakers.
