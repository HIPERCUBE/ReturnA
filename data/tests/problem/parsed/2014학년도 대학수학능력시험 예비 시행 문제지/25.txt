The National Park Service says 1,825 Burmese pythons 
have been caught in and around the Florida Everglades 
since 2000. One of the largest― over 16 feet long and 
weighing 156 pounds― was caught just in January. The 
Burmese pythons have been joined in the swamps by 
other discarded pets: African pythons and other kinds of 
snakes. They are rapidly vacuuming the Everglades clean 
of native wildlife. One python even tried to eat a live 
alligator. The National Park Service says that in areas 
where the snakes are known to be active, sightings of 
medium-size mammals have dropped by as much as 99 
percent. It’s not hard to envision what happens next. 
With their prey exhausted, the snakes will begin moving 
out of the Everglades in search of food― pets, for 
example. Florida Senator Bill Nelson says that snakes 
don’t belong in the Everglades in the first place, “and 
they certainly don’t belong in people’s backyards.”
