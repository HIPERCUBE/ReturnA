35. One time a person on my team came to me with a 
problem she was having at work. As she explained her 
struggles and feelings, I tried to figure out what exactly 
was bothering her. Her emotions were soon clear to me―
or at least I thought they were clear― as she began to 
cry. I went around the desk to give her a hug and 
reassure her, thinking that was what she wanted and 
needed from me. But I had gotten the situation all wrong. 
She absolutely recoiled. She wasn’t sad. She was angry. 
She didn’t want me to do anything other than listen and 
acknowledge the truth of the matter. She went on to tell 
me the issues that were causing her grief. I had to wait 
and let her tell me what she meant. True listening 
is .
① bridging the gap between different viewpoints
② simulating the speaker’s emotions and feelings
③ working together to build a lasting relationship
④ showing how you feel toward the people around you
⑤ creating a space for people to tell you what they mean
