30. Thistlegorm에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Packed full of artifacts and lying in the clear waters of 
the Red Sea, the Thistlegorm is perhaps the most famous 
of all shipwrecks for divers. Her fame comes at a price, 
however, with great numbers of divers crawling through 
the structure every day. The Thistlegorm first came to the 
attention of the global diving community in the 1950s, 
when she was discovered and filmed by Jacques Cousteau. 
Her location remained a secret until 1992, when she was 
rediscovered by recreational divers, and she has since 
become the most popular diving wreck in the entire Red 
Sea. The Thistlegorm was a World War II armed merchant 
vessel, 126m in length, carrying supplies to the British 8th 
Army in North Africa. Packed with machinery and 
weapons, she was spotted in the northern Red Sea by a 
German bomber on the 6th October 1941. Two bombs 
entered her Number Four hold, causing a huge explosion 
that cut her in half; she sank immediately with the loss 
of nine souls.
