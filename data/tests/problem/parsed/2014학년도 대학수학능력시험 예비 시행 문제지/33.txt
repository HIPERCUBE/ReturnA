33. During the hundreds of millions of years that plants 
have been living on our planet, they have become 
amazingly self-sufficient. In addition to establishing a 
useful relationship with the sun, plants have learned  
. When plants die, they seem 
to just fall on the ground and rot, getting eaten by many 
bugs and worms. However, researchers were shocked to 
discover that dead plants get consumed only by particular 
bacteria and fungi. Plants know how to attract to their 
own rotting only those microorganisms and earthworms 
that will produce beneficial minerals for the soil where 
the plants’ siblings will grow. One way plants attract 
particular microorganisms into their soil is by 
concentrating more sugars in their roots. Thus roots such 
as carrots and potatoes are always much sweeter than the 
rest of the plant. Apparently, the quality of the soil is 
critically important, not only as a source of water and 
minerals for plants but for their very survival.
