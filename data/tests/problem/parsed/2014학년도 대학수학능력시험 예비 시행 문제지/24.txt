Music is an art that depends on re-creation. When you 
look at a painting, a piece of sculpture, or a building, 
you experience exactly what the artist created without 
involving an intervening person. Not so with music. 
Someone must bring it to life; it requires an intermediary. 
A few compositions exist only on discs or tape, and in 
such cases there is no performing intermediary. In some 
types of music, such as jazz, the performer is the creator 
of the music because, to a degree, it is made up as the 
performer goes along. However, in most cases even 
composers can’t remember or express their own music 
completely. They can’t play several instruments at once, 
and they can’t perform their music if they are not 
physically present. So other performers are needed.
