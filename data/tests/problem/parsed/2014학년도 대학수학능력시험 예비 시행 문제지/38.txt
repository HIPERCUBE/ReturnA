Here is an uncomfortable math problem: By 2045 
Earth’s population will likely have swelled from seven 
to nine billion people.
(A) Julian Cribb, author of The Coming Famine, says higher 
yielding crop varieties and more efficient farming 
methods will be crucial. So will waste reduction. Cribb 
and other experts urge cities to reclaim nutrients and 
water from waste streams and preserve farmland.
(B) Poor countries, they say, can improve crop storage and 
packaging. And rich nations could cut back on 
resource-intensive foods like meat. In fact, wherever 
easy access to cheap food means people buy more than 
they consume, we could all start by shopping smarter―
and cleaning our plates.
(C) To fill all those stomachs―while accounting for shifting 
consumption patterns, climate change, and a finite 
amount of farmland and drinkable water― some experts 
say global food production will have to double. How 
can we make the numbers add up?
① (A) - (C) - (B) ② (B) - (A) - (C)
③ (B) - (C) - (A) ④ (C) - (A) - (B)
⑤ (C) - (B) - (A)
