36. In my mind, we do not invent laws in mathematics and 
science, but rather we discover them. . 
I believe that mathematical laws go beyond us and our 
physical reality. The statement “3 + 1 = 8” is false. Was the 
statement false before the discovery of integers? I believe it 
was. Numbers and mathematics exist whether humans know 
about them or not. Martin Gardner once stated this idea as: 
“If two dinosaurs met two other dinosaurs in a clearing, 
there would be four of them even though the animals 
would be too stupid to know that.” In other words, four 
dinosaurs are now in the clearing, whether or not humans 
are around to appreciate this fact. [3점]
