A great belt of desert stretches nearly halfway around 
the world. Starting in North India, it passes west through 
Pakistan and Afghanistan, ① continues through the Near 
East, crosses Africa as the Sahara, and leaping the 
Atlantic, ends in Mexico and the Southwest United 
States. In and near this and similar zones, perhaps one 
quarter of the world’s population lives in buildings 
constructed of sun-dried mud. The desert is both ② harsh 
and generous. The intense heat, cold, and scarcity of 
water in this environment are well known; but the desert 
also provides ③ insufficient means with which people can 
shelter themselves against these extremes. For thousands 
of years, earth has been used as ④ building material in 
the desert and dry savannah. Mud architecture is highly 
⑤ resistant to temperature change and insulates against 
the day’s heat and the night’s cold.
