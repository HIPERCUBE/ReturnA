32. There is a long and honorable history of procrastination 
to suggest that many ideas and decisions may well improve 
if postponed. It is something of a truism that to put off 
making a decision is itself a decision. The parliamentary 
process is essentially a system of delay and deliberation. 
So, for that matter, is the creation of a great painting, or an 
entrée, or a book, or a building like Blenheim Palace, 
which took the Duke of Marlborough’s architects and 
laborers 15 years to construct. In the process, the design 
can mellow and marinate. Indeed,  can be the 
assassin of elegance. As T.H. White, author of Sword in 
the Stone, once wrote, time “is not meant to be devoured 
in an hour or a day, but to be consumed delicately and 
gradually and without haste.” In other words, what you 
don’t necessarily have to do today, by all means put off 
until tomorrow. [3점]
