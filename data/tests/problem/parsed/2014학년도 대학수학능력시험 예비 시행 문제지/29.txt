The graph shows the living species index from 1970 to 
2000, which indicates trends in the world’s biodiversity 
populations of species living in land, freshwater, and 
marine ecosystems. ① Compared to 1970, all the indexes 
fell by 30 to 50 percent in 2000. ② Between 1975 and 
1980, while the marine species index declined, the 
freshwater species index increased. ③ In 1985 the freshwater 
species index was the highest, followed by the land 
species index and the marine species index. ④The freshwater 
species index decreased the least compared to the other 
indexes between 1990 and 1995. ⑤ The marine species 
index, the highest among the three in 2000, indicated an 
increase between 1999 and 2000.
