One of the rules for success is that it doesn’t matter 
where you’re coming from; all that matters is where 
you’re going. Almost everyone has the uneasy feeling 
that they have wasted a good deal of their time and their 
potential in the past. Unfortunately, many people use 
these feelings of regret as brakes that they set on their 
own lives. Instead of rededicating themselves to the 
exciting months and years ahead, they allow themselves 
to be overwhelmed with the mistakes that they made in 
the past. Don’t let this happen to you. Instead, think 
about the future and where you are going. Think about 
what you can do to create the kind of future you 
imagine for yourself. Your resolve to be future-oriented 
will give you energy and enthusiasm. And your future is 
limited only by your imagination.
① 상상력을 억압하지 마라. 
② 잠재력을 최대한 활용하라.
③ 실현 가능한 목표를 뚜렷이 설정하라.
④ 과거에 집착하지 말고 미래에 집중하라.
⑤ 과거의 경험으로부터 일의 우선순위를 정하라.
24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Music is an art that depends on re-creation. When you 
look at a painting, a piece of sculpture, or a building, 
you experience exactly what the artist created without 
involving an intervening person. Not so with music. 
Someone must bring it to life; it requires an intermediary. 
A few compositions exist only on discs or tape, and in 
such cases there is no performing intermediary. In some 
types of music, such as jazz, the performer is the creator 
of the music because, to a degree, it is made up as the 
performer goes along. However, in most cases even 
composers can’t remember or express their own music 
completely. They can’t play several instruments at once, 
and they can’t perform their music if they are not 
physically present. So other performers are needed. 
* intermediary: 중개자
① Music is brought to life by performers.
② Listeners’ appreciation completes music.
③ Composers are the genuine creators of music.
④ Composers rarely create music out of nothing.
⑤ Music depends on the audience for interpretation.
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
The National Park Service says 1,825 Burmese pythons 
have been caught in and around the Florida Everglades 
since 2000. One of the largest― over 16 feet long and 
weighing 156 pounds― was caught just in January. The 
Burmese pythons have been joined in the swamps by 
other discarded pets: African pythons and other kinds of 
snakes. They are rapidly vacuuming the Everglades clean 
of native wildlife. One python even tried to eat a live 
alligator. The National Park Service says that in areas 
where the snakes are known to be active, sightings of 
medium-size mammals have dropped by as much as 99 
percent. It’s not hard to envision what happens next. 
With their prey exhausted, the snakes will begin moving 
out of the Everglades in search of food― pets, for 
example. Florida Senator Bill Nelson says that snakes 
don’t belong in the Everglades in the first place, “and 
they certainly don’t belong in people’s backyards.”

③ Pet Pythons in People’s Backyards in Florida
④ Pythons in Florida: A Successful Transplantation

26. 밑줄 친 she[her]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? 
Sarah kept walking until a combination of curiosity and 
hunger drove ① her into an old convenience store. 
Pushing open its glass door, ② she was sucked once 
again into that other, earlier time. The storekeeper, the 
only other occupant of the place, was a wrinkled old 
woman in a faded lavender-print dress. She didn’t bother 
greeting Sarah but continued to sit motionless, conserving 
③ her energy as she watched a collection of counter 
goods that might have sprung straight out of Sarah’s 
childhood. A price list stuck up crooked beside the candy 
told her ④ she could buy half a loaf of oversweetened 
white bread, if she wanted, or a scoop of frozen peas. 
There was nothing here that Sarah felt like eating. She 
nodded at the woman, who once again failed to 
acknowledge ⑤ her, and left the shop.
27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
“Aerobic” means “with oxygen.” It’s not surprising that 
the demands you make on your body when you ask it to 
sustain an aerobic activity train your lungs to deliver 
oxygen and your heart ① to pump out greater amounts of 
blood to carry that oxygen to your working muscles. 
Your body also responds to this challenge by producing 
and storing something ② referred to as aerobic enzymes. 
These enzymes help you burn more fat, which is another 
reason why aerobic exercise has ③ such a pronounced 
effect on your body fat. This effect, which is often 
overlooked, is a primary reason why people ④ do aerobic 
exercises establish a new metabolism and a leaner body. 
Yet another benefit of aerobic training is ⑤ that it 
enables your muscles to better use oxygen to perform 
work over extended periods of time. 
28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지

A great belt of desert stretches nearly halfway around 
the world. Starting in North India, it passes west through 
Pakistan and Afghanistan, ① continues through the Near 
East, crosses Africa as the Sahara, and leaping the 
Atlantic, ends in Mexico and the Southwest United 
States. In and near this and similar zones, perhaps one 
quarter of the world’s population lives in buildings 
constructed of sun-dried mud. The desert is both ② harsh 
and generous. The intense heat, cold, and scarcity of 
water in this environment are well known; but the desert 
also provides ③ insufficient means with which people can 
shelter themselves against these extremes. For thousands 
of years, earth has been used as ④ building material in 
the desert and dry savannah. Mud architecture is highly 
⑤ resistant to temperature change and insulates against 
the day’s heat and the night’s cold. 
* insulate: 차단하다

The graph shows the living species index from 1970 to 
2000, which indicates trends in the world’s biodiversity 
populations of species living in land, freshwater, and 
marine ecosystems. ① Compared to 1970, all the indexes 
fell by 30 to 50 percent in 2000. ② Between 1975 and 
1980, while the marine species index declined, the 
freshwater species index increased. ③ In 1985 the freshwater 
species index was the highest, followed by the land 
species index and the marine species index. ④The freshwater 
species index decreased the least compared to the other 
indexes between 1990 and 1995. ⑤ The marine species 
index, the highest among the three in 2000, indicated an 
increase between 1999 and 2000.
30. Thistlegorm에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Packed full of artifacts and lying in the clear waters of 
the Red Sea, the Thistlegorm is perhaps the most famous 
of all shipwrecks for divers. Her fame comes at a price, 
however, with great numbers of divers crawling through 
the structure every day. The Thistlegorm first came to the 
attention of the global diving community in the 1950s, 
when she was discovered and filmed by Jacques Cousteau. 
Her location remained a secret until 1992, when she was 
rediscovered by recreational divers, and she has since 
become the most popular diving wreck in the entire Red 
Sea. The Thistlegorm was a World War II armed merchant 
vessel, 126m in length, carrying supplies to the British 8th 
Army in North Africa. Packed with machinery and 
weapons, she was spotted in the northern Red Sea by a 
German bomber on the 6th October 1941. Two bombs 
entered her Number Four hold, causing a huge explosion 
that cut her in half; she sank immediately with the loss 
of nine souls.
① Red Sea에 있다.
② Jacques Cousteau에 의해 촬영되었다. 
③ 보급품을 수송하는 독일군 군함이었다.
④ 기계류와 무기를 싣고 있었다.
⑤ 폭격을 받고 가라앉았다.


35. One time a person on my team came to me with a 
problem she was having at work. As she explained her 
struggles and feelings, I tried to figure out what exactly 
was bothering her. Her emotions were soon clear to me―
or at least I thought they were clear― as she began to 
cry. I went around the desk to give her a hug and 
reassure her, thinking that was what she wanted and 
needed from me. But I had gotten the situation all wrong. 
She absolutely recoiled. She wasn’t sad. She was angry. 
She didn’t want me to do anything other than listen and 
acknowledge the truth of the matter. She went on to tell 
me the issues that were causing her grief. I had to wait 
and let her tell me what she meant. True listening 
is .
① bridging the gap between different viewpoints
② simulating the speaker’s emotions and feelings
③ working together to build a lasting relationship
④ showing how you feel toward the people around you
⑤ creating a space for people to tell you what they mean
36. In my mind, we do not invent laws in mathematics and 
science, but rather we discover them. . 
I believe that mathematical laws go beyond us and our 
physical reality. The statement “3 + 1 = 8” is false. Was the 
statement false before the discovery of integers? I believe it 
was. Numbers and mathematics exist whether humans know 
about them or not. Martin Gardner once stated this idea as: 
“If two dinosaurs met two other dinosaurs in a clearing, 
there would be four of them even though the animals 
would be too stupid to know that.” In other words, four 
dinosaurs are now in the clearing, whether or not humans 
are around to appreciate this fact. [3점]

① They are subject to changes and modifications
② They have an existence independent from us
③ Most of them originated from numbers
④ They are key to learning basic calculation
⑤ Logical investigations give them true meaning

Color adds beauty to our lives, but it does more than that. 
Color serves important signaling functions, both natural and 
contrived by humans. The natural and human-made world 
provides many color signals that help us identify things. I 
know a banana is ripe when it has turned yellow and I know 
to stop when the traffic light turns red.   (A)   , 
color helps facilitate perceptual organization, the process by 
which small elements become grouped perceptually into 
larger objects. Color perception greatly facilitates the ability 
to tell one object from another and especially to pick out 
objects within scenes, an ability crucial to the survival of 
many species. (B) , consider a monkey searching 
for fruit in the forest. A monkey with good color vision 
easily detects red fruit against a green background, but a 
color-blind monkey would find it more difficult to find the 
fruit. Color vision thus enhances the contrast of objects that, 
if they didn’t appear colored, would appear more similar.
(A) (B)
① In addition …… However 
② In addition …… For example
③ In contrast …… Similarly
④ Nonetheless …… Moreover
⑤ Nonetheless …… On the other hand

Here is an uncomfortable math problem: By 2045 
Earth’s population will likely have swelled from seven 
to nine billion people.
(A) Julian Cribb, author of The Coming Famine, says higher 
yielding crop varieties and more efficient farming 
methods will be crucial. So will waste reduction. Cribb 
and other experts urge cities to reclaim nutrients and 
water from waste streams and preserve farmland.
(B) Poor countries, they say, can improve crop storage and 
packaging. And rich nations could cut back on 
resource-intensive foods like meat. In fact, wherever 
easy access to cheap food means people buy more than 
they consume, we could all start by shopping smarter―
and cleaning our plates.
(C) To fill all those stomachs―while accounting for shifting 
consumption patterns, climate change, and a finite 
amount of farmland and drinkable water― some experts 
say global food production will have to double. How 
can we make the numbers add up?

But they ran out of the special offers so you have to 
buy another of the meals at full price. 
On the way home from work you see an excellent 
bargain: a really good ready meal at 25 percent of the 
usual cost. ( ① ) You snap up one but when you get home 
you feel like having a friend around. ( ② ) You phone, she 
agrees, so you pop out for another bargain. ( ③ ) The 
worst is to come: you heat up both meals and then your 
friend phones to say something has come up and she can’t 
make it. ( ④ ) You have two hot, unreheatable meals: you 
have to throw one away. ( ⑤ ) Despite the fact that the 
meals are identical, economists say, people nearly always 
eat the one for which they paid full price.

Classification allows us to focus on one or two features 
and see something in terms of those characteristics alone. 
To classify plants and animals, we have to ignore all the 
variations that distinguish one plant from another and 
one animal from another. We have to focus only on 
those aspects that are shared by all plants and that 
differentiate them from all animals. We ignore the great 
variation that exists within each group and reduce its 
members to the common ground that ties all the 
members of that group together. As a result, we come to 
see objects in terms of their membership in a particular 
group, and we miss seeing that each is more than its 
group membership. Trapped by the category of doors, we 
become blind to the three-by-seven-foot pieces of wood 
that are right in front of us.
󰀻
In classification, we concentrate on a few features 
(A)  to group members, and in doing so, we 
tend to (B)  individual variations within the 
group.
(A) (B)
① varying …… identify
② existing …… verify
③ special …… prefer
④ important …… include
⑤ common …… overlook
[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. 
Before 1969, a watch was just a watch. There were 
manual and automatic-winding watches, calendar 
watches, and many other types of watches. All were 
powered by mechanical-movement systems, and accuracy 
was of the utmost importance. In 1969, quartz watches 
were introduced. They were much more accurate than 
previous watches― and much cheaper. Within a decade 
of their introduction, quartz watches dominated the 
industry. Mechanical watch makers faced two obvious 
but unattractive options: Attempt a highly uncertain 
transition to produce quartz movement or redouble 
efforts to improve the price and performance of their 
mechanical-movement devices, thereby merely narrowing, 
but not closing, the performance gap with quartz.
Insightful firms, however, recognized a third option. 
They realized that the rise of the quartz watch meant that 
for the first time, consumers could choose between 
mechanical and nonmechanical watches. In other words, 
the introduction of nonmechanical watches made some 
consumers aware of their preference for “mechanicalness.” 
These watchmakers began their products 
with this type of consumer in mind. One result was a shift 
from the industry norm of hiding watch mechanisms 
within the case to making parts visible in order to show 
off the increasingly complicated, visually stimulating 
mechanical movements.
Clearly, the niche of consumers who valued the mechanical 
quality of a watch was smaller than the larger watch 
market. However, these consumers were willing to pay a 
higher price. And perhaps more important, this niche was 
immune to attack from quartz watchmakers.

[43～45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
About eight years ago storyteller Melissa Heckler 
arrived at a school ready to tell a few tales. Her 
classroom audience included children at risk because of 
learning difficulties, poverty, and other problems. The 
school suggested that Heckler not tell any family stories, 
assuming that the last thing such kids wanted to hear or 
talk about was family life. So (a) she told the students 
folk tales. “To everyone’s surprise, the kids who were 
most at risk were the most responsive,” says Heckler. 
“They used the stories as a mask― as a way to tell 
their own secrets.”
(B)
Heckler also asks the kids to collect stories from 
family members and friends. To make telling those 
stories a playful activity during class, (b) she sometimes 
has the children present their stories as if they were 
doing a radio program, complete with a student 
moderator and guest appearances by student storytellers. 
Or they might act out a TV show and tell the tales to a 
video camera. Other times the kids simply share the 
stories with their classmates. 
(C)
Regardless of how the stories are staged, the children 
continually surprise Heckler with their honesty and their 
revelations. “One girl’s father was a firefighter,” remembers 
Heckler, “and she told a story about her father’s being 
injured on the job. When the girl told the story, she 
showed so much dignity, and from that day, the other 
kids treated (c) her differently, more kindly. Telling their 
own stories gives them a chance to express their heart 
and their strengths. They begin to see their own 
richness.”
(D)
Heckler’s repertoire does not stop with folk tales. (d) She 
also uses personal stories, her own and the children’s, to 
draw the kids out. She may have the children ask her 
questions, or (e) she may simply tell a tale about herself. 
“It doesn’t matter whether you’ve had a rough life or a 
privileged one. What matters is that you’re telling them 
your story,” explains Heckler. “They have to sense that 
what you’re telling them is real. They need to see you as 
a person. That will help them open up and tell their 
stories.”
