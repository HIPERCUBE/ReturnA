There are several advantages to a partnership which is an
agreement between two or more people to finance and operate
a business. ①With more than one owner, the ability to raise
funds may be increased, both because two or more partners
may be able to contribute more funds and because their
borrowing capacity may be greater. ②As a partnership may
benefit from the combination of complementary skills of two
or more people, there is a wider pool of knowledge, skills and
contacts. ③ Partnerships can be cost­effective as each partner
specializes in certain aspects of their business. ④ In addition,
partnerships may have a limited life; they may end up with the
withdrawal or death of a partner. ⑤ Partnerships will provide
moral support and allow more creative brainstorming.
