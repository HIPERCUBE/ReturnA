There are several advantages to a partnership which is an
agreement between two or more people to finance and operate
a business. ①With more than one owner, the ability to raise
funds may be increased, both because two or more partners
may be able to contribute more funds and because their
borrowing capacity may be greater. ②As a partnership may
benefit from the combination of complementary skills of two
or more people, there is a wider pool of knowledge, skills and
contacts. ③ Partnerships can be cost­effective as each partner
specializes in certain aspects of their business. ④ In addition,
partnerships may have a limited life; they may end up with the
withdrawal or death of a partner. ⑤ Partnerships will provide
moral support and allow more creative brainstorming.

Most customers who have a negative experience in your
business don’t bother to tell you about it. They just walk
out and never return. So, negative reviews are hard to get.
Once you get them, however, they let you see what customers
expected and what they experienced. With this information,
you can figure out what happened and how you should
respond. Of course, getting negative reviews can be a bitter
experience. However, if you can endure the sting of the
negative comments and really examine the information they
contain, you can improve your customers’ experiences, which
increases customers’ loyalty and brings new customers to you.
① effects of ads on customers’ purchase
② ways to investigate customers’ complaints
③ the value of customers’ negative reviews

36. whistling thorn에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
A whistling thorn is an acacia tree which is commonly
seen on the savannas of East Africa. If you stand next to
the tree, you might hear it whistling. The noise comes from
the wind blowing through holes in swellings at the base of
the thorns, which act like tiny flutes. Thanks to its musical
ability, the acacia tree is called the whistling thorn. The
swollen thorns provide homes for particularly aggressive
types of ants, the acacia ants. In addition, the tree produces
sugary secretions that feed the ants. In return, the ants
protect the tree from animals. In fact, this particular acacia
doesn’t have the toxic chemicals that keep away insects and
animals like other species of acacias do. So, when a giraffe
tries to grab a mouthful of leaves with its tongue, the ants
swarm out of their thorns and attack with vicious stings.
* secretion: 분비액
① 동아프리카의 사바나 지역에 서식한다.

Studies show that people all over the world imagine time
as something spatial. We say that the past is behind us and
the future is in front of us. We think and speak as though
we were actually moving away from a yesterday that is
located over there and towards a tomorrow that is located in
the opposite direction. When we draw a time line, those who
speak English put the past on the left, those who speak
Arabic put the past on the right, and those who speak
Chinese put the past on the bottom. But regardless of our
native tongue, we all put the past someplace and the future
someplace else.

Most of us are already aware of the direct effect we have
on our friends and family; our actions can make them happy
or sad, healthy or sick, even rich or poor. But we rarely
consider that everything we think of, feel, do, or say can
spread far beyond the people we know, through our friends
and family. They also serve as pathways through which we
are influenced by hundreds or even thousands of other
people. In a kind of social chain reaction, we can be deeply
affected by events that happen to people we do not know. It
is as if we can feel the pulse of the social world around us
and respond to its constant rhythm. As part of a social
network, we go beyond ourselves and become a part of
something much larger.
* pulse: 맥박
① We Are Socially Connected
② Family: The Root of Happiness
③ Importance of ‘Give and Take’
④ Society: A Field of Competition
⑤ Side Effects of Social Network Services

As time passes, however, people get used to what they
have and, just like the smell of fresh bread, these
wonderful things disappear from their consciousness.
If you walk into a room that smells of freshly baked
bread, you quickly detect the rather pleasant aroma. ( ① )
However, stay in the room for a few minutes, and the smell
will seem to disappear. ( ② ) In fact, the only way to
reawaken it is to walk out of the room and come back in
again. ( ③ ) Exactly the same concept applies to many
areas of our lives, including happiness. ( ④ ) Everyone has
something to be happy about: a loving partner, good health,
great kids, a satisfying job, or enough food to eat. ( ⑤ )
As the old saying goes, you don’t know what you’ve got till
it’s gone.

There was a series of experiments about factors which
affect the way of people’s behaviors. In the first of the
experiments, commuters gave more money to a charity
collector at the top of an escalator than to one at the
bottom. In another experiment 60 volunteers were asked
to give out an amount of hot chilli sauce to be eaten by
a stranger who they were told disliked hot food. Those
who had been taken up to a stage dished out less than
half the amount than those who had been taken down to
an orchestra pit. And in a third, people were less likely
to inflict punishment on another person after they
ascended steps― and were crueler after they went down
stairs. The link between where we are and how we
behave may sound unlikely, but psychologists say there
are plenty of clues linking the two in real life.
According to the experiments above, people’s (A) is

[41-42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Daniel, a freshman in college, enrolled in a public
speaking course. There was one senior in the class
named Rick, who spoke with authority. Daniel would sit
fascinated by the sound of his voice. Rick would stand
behind the podium, almost motionless, with only the
slightest twist of the wrist or a subtle tilting of his head
to emphasize a point. What confidence! Daniel now had a
role model for speaking.
As he practiced his speech, Daniel literally spent hours
trying to Rick’s deep, resonant musical notes.
As he practiced, his body wanted to dance. But Daniel
restricted his movement, so he could Rick’s
subtle gestures and posturing. His practice was paying
off. He was speaking and moving just like Rick.
One morning in class, Daniel got up to speak. His
voice was deep like Rick’s. His gestures were as subtle
as any Rick had presented. In fact, Daniel felt like he
was Rick! But something wasn’t right. It wasn’t until
after class that Lucy, one of the other students, came up
to Daniel and said, “I liked the ‘friendly’ Daniel more.”
That’s all she had to say. She liked the old Daniel, and
not his imitation of Rick. Daniel took Lucy’s comment to
heart, and two weeks later he delivered his next speech
in a more relaxed and conversational tone of voice. He
talked and moved naturally. He wasn’t acting like
somebody else. And it felt right.
