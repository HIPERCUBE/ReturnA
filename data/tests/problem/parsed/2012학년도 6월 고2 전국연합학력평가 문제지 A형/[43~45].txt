(A)
Sarah and her older cousin Ann went surfing at Binalong
Bay. “Today is the perfect day for surfing,” said Sarah.
She was thrilled to go surfing with her favorite cousin.
Ann was the very person who had taught (a) her how to
surf when she was little. As soon as they arrived at the
beach, they went in and waited to catch the perfect
wave.
(B)
Sarah was then rushed to a hospital for treatment. The
shark’s teeth had bitten down to the bone of her lower
right leg. The bite required more than 200 stitches. But
the wounded teenager said she did not want the shark to
be hunted down and killed. (b) She said, “The shark has
the right to live like any other animal. I was in its
territory. It’s not its fault.”
(C)
When the shark came up to the surface, Ann punched
it repeatedly. The shark let Sarah go. After placing
Sarah on the board, Ann helped (c) her to the shore.
The shark kept chasing them, but luckily a big wave
pushed them toward the shore. They reached the beach
safely and called for help. Ann used the leg rope from
Sarah’s shark­bitten board to stop the loss of blood from
(d) her wound.
(D)
After riding a couple of waves, Sarah and Ann sat on their
boards to take a rest. At that moment, a five­meter
shark bit Sarah on the right leg. Ann was about seven
meters away. (e) She paddled hard to her younger cousin.
The shark attacked Sarah three times under the water; it
bit her leg twice and took a large piece out of her
board.
