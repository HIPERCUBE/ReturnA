Most customers who have a negative experience in your
business don’t bother to tell you about it. They just walk
out and never return. So, negative reviews are hard to get.
Once you get them, however, they let you see what customers
expected and what they experienced. With this information,
you can figure out what happened and how you should
respond. Of course, getting negative reviews can be a bitter
experience. However, if you can endure the sting of the
negative comments and really examine the information they
contain, you can improve your customers’ experiences, which
increases customers’ loyalty and brings new customers to you.
