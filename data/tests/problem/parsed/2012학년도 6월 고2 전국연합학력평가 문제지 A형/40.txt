There was a series of experiments about factors which
affect the way of people’s behaviors. In the first of the
experiments, commuters gave more money to a charity
collector at the top of an escalator than to one at the
bottom. In another experiment 60 volunteers were asked
to give out an amount of hot chilli sauce to be eaten by
a stranger who they were told disliked hot food. Those
who had been taken up to a stage dished out less than
half the amount than those who had been taken down to
an orchestra pit. And in a third, people were less likely
to inflict punishment on another person after they
ascended steps― and were crueler after they went down
stairs. The link between where we are and how we
behave may sound unlikely, but psychologists say there
are plenty of clues linking the two in real life.
According to the experiments above, people’s (A) is
likely to be influenced by the (B) of the place where
they are located.
(A) (B)
① patience atmosphere
② generosity height
③ patience height
④ generosity size

Daniel, a freshman in college, enrolled in a public
speaking course. There was one senior in the class
named Rick, who spoke with authority. Daniel would sit
fascinated by the sound of his voice. Rick would stand
behind the podium, almost motionless, with only the
slightest twist of the wrist or a subtle tilting of his head
to emphasize a point. What confidence! Daniel now had a
role model for speaking.
As he practiced his speech, Daniel literally spent hours
trying to Rick’s deep, resonant musical notes.
As he practiced, his body wanted to dance. But Daniel
restricted his movement, so he could Rick’s
subtle gestures and posturing. His practice was paying
off. He was speaking and moving just like Rick.
One morning in class, Daniel got up to speak. His
voice was deep like Rick’s. His gestures were as subtle
as any Rick had presented. In fact, Daniel felt like he
was Rick! But something wasn’t right. It wasn’t until
after class that Lucy, one of the other students, came up
to Daniel and said, “I liked the ‘friendly’ Daniel more.”
That’s all she had to say. She liked the old Daniel, and
not his imitation of Rick. Daniel took Lucy’s comment to
heart, and two weeks later he delivered his next speech
in a more relaxed and conversational tone of voice. He
talked and moved naturally. He wasn’t acting like
somebody else. And it felt right.
