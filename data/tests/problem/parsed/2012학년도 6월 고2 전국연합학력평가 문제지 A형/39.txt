As time passes, however, people get used to what they
have and, just like the smell of fresh bread, these
wonderful things disappear from their consciousness.
If you walk into a room that smells of freshly baked
bread, you quickly detect the rather pleasant aroma. ( ① )

will seem to disappear. ( ② ) In fact, the only way to
reawaken it is to walk out of the room and come back in
again. ( ③ ) Exactly the same concept applies to many
areas of our lives, including happiness. ( ④ ) Everyone has
something to be happy about: a loving partner, good health,
great kids, a satisfying job, or enough food to eat. ( ⑤ )
As the old saying goes, you don’t know what you’ve got till
it’s gone.
* reawaken: 다시 일깨우다
