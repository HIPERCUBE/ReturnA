Daniel, a freshman in college, enrolled in a public
speaking course. There was one senior in the class
named Rick, who spoke with authority. Daniel would sit
fascinated by the sound of his voice. Rick would stand
behind the podium, almost motionless, with only the
slightest twist of the wrist or a subtle tilting of his head
to emphasize a point. What confidence! Daniel now had a
role model for speaking.
As he practiced his speech, Daniel literally spent hours
trying to Rick’s deep, resonant musical notes.
As he practiced, his body wanted to dance. But Daniel
restricted his movement, so he could Rick’s
subtle gestures and posturing. His practice was paying
off. He was speaking and moving just like Rick.
One morning in class, Daniel got up to speak. His
voice was deep like Rick’s. His gestures were as subtle
as any Rick had presented. In fact, Daniel felt like he
was Rick! But something wasn’t right. It wasn’t until
after class that Lucy, one of the other students, came up
to Daniel and said, “I liked the ‘friendly’ Daniel more.”
That’s all she had to say. She liked the old Daniel, and
not his imitation of Rick. Daniel took Lucy’s comment to
heart, and two weeks later he delivered his next speech
in a more relaxed and conversational tone of voice. He
talked and moved naturally. He wasn’t acting like
somebody else. And it felt right.
