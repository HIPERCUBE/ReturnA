23. 다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?
There is a need out here that your station could fill. Ask
yourself, “What is more widely found in homes and offices
than even computers or TVs?” Answer: the potted plant. But
are these plants healthy and growing? Many times not. I
think a weekly evening program on basic indoor plant care
would be a big hit with your listeners. Rather than
overwhelm your audience with agricultural information, take
a light approach to the subject. Put some fun into describing
plants and plant care. The program could touch on
little­known topics like the effect of office music or
electromagnetic fields on plants. You could even have a
call­in segment for people to ask questions and share their
experiences. Doesn’t this sound like a winner? I think so.

24. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
Some of the things we have to do ① are tiring and annoying.
We must do many of these things regardless of ② how we
feel about them. Doing the dishes day after day can be a
tiring job, but no matter how much we hate it, it must ③ do
sooner or later. However, chores like this can actually be
enjoyable. Perhaps dish washing is a time for listening to
music and ④ singing along. Also, it can be a time for
conversation between family members as we help one
another. If we try to look for the ⑤ hidden treasures and
opportunities in tiring and annoying jobs, they will never fail
to reward us.
25. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? [3점]
There are several advantages to a partnership which is an
agreement between two or more people to finance and operate
a business. ①With more than one owner, the ability to raise
funds may be increased, both because two or more partners
may be able to contribute more funds and because their
borrowing capacity may be greater. ②As a partnership may
benefit from the combination of complementary skills of two
or more people, there is a wider pool of knowledge, skills and
contacts. ③ Partnerships can be cost­effective as each partner
specializes in certain aspects of their business. ④ In addition,
partnerships may have a limited life; they may end up with the
withdrawal or death of a partner. ⑤ Partnerships will provide
moral support and allow more creative brainstorming.

31. It is easy to fall into the habit of criticizing others, even

place. To live a happier, more peaceful life, try to see that

절한 것은?
Our genes determine whether we are morning people or
night owls, and our daily routine needs to be adapted to our
internal clock. If we fight it, we pay dearly. Our society is
better suited to the rhythm of morning people, which is why
the classic late riser often (A) benefits / suffers from what a
scholar calls “social jetlag.” Some high school students have
to go to school at what their bodies consider the middle of
the night; late risers whose efficiency would normally

34. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Most customers who have a negative experience in your
business don’t bother to tell you about it. They just walk
out and never return. So, negative reviews are hard to get.
Once you get them, however, they let you see what customers
expected and what they experienced. With this information,
you can figure out what happened and how you should
respond. Of course, getting negative reviews can be a bitter
experience. However, if you can endure the sting of the
negative comments and really examine the information they
contain, you can improve your customers’ experiences, which
increases customers’ loyalty and brings new customers to you.
① effects of ads on customers’ purchase
② ways to investigate customers’ complaints
③ the value of customers’ negative reviews
④ the importance of correct product information
⑤ how to protect customers’ personal information

The above graph shows the rate of parents who respond
they are doing a “very good” job as a parent or in balancing
work and family. ①Women are more likely than men to say
they are doing a very good job both as a parent and in
balancing work and family. ② Eight­in­ten mothers of younger
children rate themselves as a very good parent, while 63 %
of fathers with younger children do so. ③About two­thirds
of fathers with older children say they are doing a very
good job as a parent. ④More than three quaters of mothers
with older children say they are doing a very good job in
balancing work and family. ⑤ Fathers with older children are
less likely than those with younger children to give
themselves high marks in balancing work and family.
36. whistling thorn에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
A whistling thorn is an acacia tree which is commonly
seen on the savannas of East Africa. If you stand next to
the tree, you might hear it whistling. The noise comes from
the wind blowing through holes in swellings at the base of
the thorns, which act like tiny flutes. Thanks to its musical
ability, the acacia tree is called the whistling thorn. The
swollen thorns provide homes for particularly aggressive
types of ants, the acacia ants. In addition, the tree produces
sugary secretions that feed the ants. In return, the ants
protect the tree from animals. In fact, this particular acacia
doesn’t have the toxic chemicals that keep away insects and
animals like other species of acacias do. So, when a giraffe
tries to grab a mouthful of leaves with its tongue, the ants
swarm out of their thorns and attack with vicious stings.
* secretion: 분비액
① 동아프리카의 사바나 지역에 서식한다.
② 가시 아래 부분의 부푼 곳에 구멍이 있다.

⑤ 자신을 보호하기 위한 독성 물질을 만들어 낸다.
37. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Studies show that people all over the world imagine time
as something spatial. We say that the past is behind us and
the future is in front of us. We think and speak as though
we were actually moving away from a yesterday that is
located over there and towards a tomorrow that is located in
the opposite direction. When we draw a time line, those who
speak English put the past on the left, those who speak
Arabic put the past on the right, and those who speak
Chinese put the past on the bottom. But regardless of our
native tongue, we all put the past someplace and the future
someplace else.

⑤ 개인의 시간관념은 그 사람의 언어에 반영되어 있다.
38. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Most of us are already aware of the direct effect we have
on our friends and family; our actions can make them happy
or sad, healthy or sick, even rich or poor. But we rarely
consider that everything we think of, feel, do, or say can
spread far beyond the people we know, through our friends
and family. They also serve as pathways through which we
are influenced by hundreds or even thousands of other
people. In a kind of social chain reaction, we can be deeply
affected by events that happen to people we do not know. It
is as if we can feel the pulse of the social world around us
and respond to its constant rhythm. As part of a social
network, we go beyond ourselves and become a part of
something much larger.
* pulse: 맥박
① We Are Socially Connected
② Family: The Root of Happiness
③ Importance of ‘Give and Take’
④ Society: A Field of Competition
⑤ Side Effects of Social Network Services

곳은?
As time passes, however, people get used to what they
have and, just like the smell of fresh bread, these
wonderful things disappear from their consciousness.
If you walk into a room that smells of freshly baked
bread, you quickly detect the rather pleasant aroma. ( ① )
However, stay in the room for a few minutes, and the smell
will seem to disappear. ( ② ) In fact, the only way to
reawaken it is to walk out of the room and come back in
again. ( ③ ) Exactly the same concept applies to many
areas of our lives, including happiness. ( ④ ) Everyone has
something to be happy about: a loving partner, good health,
great kids, a satisfying job, or enough food to eat. ( ⑤ )
As the old saying goes, you don’t know what you’ve got till
it’s gone.

There was a series of experiments about factors which
affect the way of people’s behaviors. In the first of the
experiments, commuters gave more money to a charity
collector at the top of an escalator than to one at the
bottom. In another experiment 60 volunteers were asked
to give out an amount of hot chilli sauce to be eaten by
a stranger who they were told disliked hot food. Those
who had been taken up to a stage dished out less than
half the amount than those who had been taken down to
an orchestra pit. And in a third, people were less likely
to inflict punishment on another person after they
ascended steps― and were crueler after they went down
stairs. The link between where we are and how we
behave may sound unlikely, but psychologists say there
are plenty of clues linking the two in real life.
According to the experiments above, people’s (A) is
likely to be influenced by the (B) of the place where
they are located.

[41-42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Daniel, a freshman in college, enrolled in a public
speaking course. There was one senior in the class
named Rick, who spoke with authority. Daniel would sit
fascinated by the sound of his voice. Rick would stand
behind the podium, almost motionless, with only the
slightest twist of the wrist or a subtle tilting of his head
to emphasize a point. What confidence! Daniel now had a
role model for speaking.
As he practiced his speech, Daniel literally spent hours
trying to Rick’s deep, resonant musical notes.
As he practiced, his body wanted to dance. But Daniel
restricted his movement, so he could Rick’s
subtle gestures and posturing. His practice was paying
off. He was speaking and moving just like Rick.
One morning in class, Daniel got up to speak. His
voice was deep like Rick’s. His gestures were as subtle
as any Rick had presented. In fact, Daniel felt like he
was Rick! But something wasn’t right. It wasn’t until
after class that Lucy, one of the other students, came up
to Daniel and said, “I liked the ‘friendly’ Daniel more.”
That’s all she had to say. She liked the old Daniel, and
not his imitation of Rick. Daniel took Lucy’s comment to
heart, and two weeks later he delivered his next speech
in a more relaxed and conversational tone of voice. He
talked and moved naturally. He wasn’t acting like
somebody else. And it felt right.

(A)
Sarah and her older cousin Ann went surfing at Binalong
Bay. “Today is the perfect day for surfing,” said Sarah.
She was thrilled to go surfing with her favorite cousin.
Ann was the very person who had taught (a) her how to
surf when she was little. As soon as they arrived at the
beach, they went in and waited to catch the perfect
wave.
(B)
Sarah was then rushed to a hospital for treatment. The
shark’s teeth had bitten down to the bone of her lower
right leg. The bite required more than 200 stitches. But
the wounded teenager said she did not want the shark to
be hunted down and killed. (b) She said, “The shark has
the right to live like any other animal. I was in its
territory. It’s not its fault.”
(C)
When the shark came up to the surface, Ann punched
it repeatedly. The shark let Sarah go. After placing
Sarah on the board, Ann helped (c) her to the shore.
The shark kept chasing them, but luckily a big wave
pushed them toward the shore. They reached the beach
safely and called for help. Ann used the leg rope from
Sarah’s shark­bitten board to stop the loss of blood from
(d) her wound.
(D)
After riding a couple of waves, Sarah and Ann sat on their
boards to take a rest. At that moment, a five­meter
shark bit Sarah on the right leg. Ann was about seven
meters away. (e) She paddled hard to her younger cousin.
The shark attacked Sarah three times under the water; it
bit her leg twice and took a large piece out of her
board.
