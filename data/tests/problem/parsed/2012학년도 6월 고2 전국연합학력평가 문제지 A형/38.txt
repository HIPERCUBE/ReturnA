Most of us are already aware of the direct effect we have
on our friends and family; our actions can make them happy
or sad, healthy or sick, even rich or poor. But we rarely
consider that everything we think of, feel, do, or say can
spread far beyond the people we know, through our friends
and family. They also serve as pathways through which we
are influenced by hundreds or even thousands of other
people. In a kind of social chain reaction, we can be deeply
affected by events that happen to people we do not know. It
is as if we can feel the pulse of the social world around us
and respond to its constant rhythm. As part of a social
network, we go beyond ourselves and become a part of
something much larger.
