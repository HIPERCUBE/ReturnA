When we want something badly for our children, so badly 
that we behave in ways that aren’t helpful for our kids, it 
can mean we’re trying to fulfill a need for ourselves. It’s 
normal to feel good when your child wins, it’s normal to 
want him to win, but when you need him to win in order to 
feel good about yourself, you have a problem. For example, 
do you feel like having a child who is a winner proves 
you’re a worthwhile parent? Do you crave the recognition of 
being the parent of a star athlete? If you can answer yes to 
either question, you may be trying to feel good about 
yourself through your child’s athletic accomplishments. This 
is a very common problem. Be willing to take an honest 
look at yourself. The payoff is tremendous. You become a 
more aware sports parent who can offer true support and 
encouragement to your child.
