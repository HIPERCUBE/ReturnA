give thanks for the services, so we would like to use 
this letter as an example of the customer’s 
satisfactory remarks in our new brochure if you give

When we want something badly for our children, so badly 
that we behave in ways that aren’t helpful for our kids, it 
can mean we’re trying to fulfill a need for ourselves. It’s 
normal to feel good when your child wins, it’s normal to 
want him to win, but when you need him to win in order to 
feel good about yourself, you have a problem. For example, 
do you feel like having a child who is a winner proves 
you’re a worthwhile parent? Do you crave the recognition of 
being the parent of a star athlete? If you can answer yes to 
either question, you may be trying to feel good about 
yourself through your child’s athletic accomplishments. This 
is a very common problem. Be willing to take an honest 
look at yourself. The payoff is tremendous. You become a 
more aware sports parent who can offer true support and 
encouragement to your child.

The surface of the earth is different from place to place. 
Places differ in terms of population size, language, 
resources, environmental factors, industrial specialization, 
local history, and human activities. It is these differences 
from place to place that generate the demand for 
transportation. People want commodities that are not 
produced locally — for example, fruits, vegetables, televisions, 
shoes, paper, and thousands of other goods — and this desire 
generates the demand for transportation. Businesses need 
resources that are often not available locally, and this need 
generates the demand for transportation. We work, shop, and 
seek entertainment, for the most part, outside our own 
neighborhoods, necessitating a journey to work, to shop, and 
to visit the multiplex. Transportation enables us to carry out 
all these activities.

21. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Tradition is a critical element that cannot be ignored in 
the creation of architecture. Tradition is the essential 
element that allows a new work to connect with people on 
an emotional and intellectual level. The recollection of the 
familiar is one aspect of design that produces pleasure. This 
feeling of pleasure or satisfaction exists because we enjoy a 
sense of security among things that we know and 
understand. References to a previous tradition are a common 
component of most major architectural movements. While 
these movements utilized new technologies and building 
materials, or invented new building forms, each evoked an 
emotional response having its roots in an earlier tradition.
① tradition as an important factor in architecture
② efforts to express feelings in various arts
③ innovation in the use of building materials
④ new technologies utilized in modern buildings
⑤ effects of technological innovations on tradition
22. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
There’s no subject you don’t have permission to write 
about. Students often avoid subjects close to their heart ―
skateboarding, cheerleading, rock music, cars ― because they 
assume that their teachers will regard these topics as 
‘stupid.’ No area of life is stupid to someone who takes it 
seriously. If you follow your affections, you will write well 
and will engage your readers. I’ve read elegant books on 
fishing, mountain climbing, giant sea turtles and many other 
subjects I didn’t think I was interested in. Write about your 
hobbies: cooking, gardening, photography, knitting, jogging, 
sailing, scuba diving. Write about your work: teaching, 
nursing, running a store. Write about a field you enjoyed in 
college and always meant to get back to: history, biography, 
art, archeology. No subject is too specialized if you make an 
honest connection with it when you write about it.

Measures People Take to Maintain Their Physical Health
The above graph shows, by gender, the top five 
measures people took to maintain their physical health in 
2014. ① Above all, the percentage of women was higher 
than that of men in all measures except in doing exercise. 
② Getting enough sleep topped the list for both men and 
women. ③ Eating healthy food was the second most 
common measure for women, which was true also for men. 
④ The percentage of the men receiving regular oral care 
was the same as that of the men spending time with 
friends and family. ⑤ The percentage gap between men and 
women was the biggest in receiving regular oral care, and 
was the smallest in getting enough sleep and in doing 
exercise.
24. Maria Mitchell에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Maria Mitchell was born on August 1, 1818, in Nantucket, 
Massachusetts. Her awareness for astronomy came to life 
when her father began to teach her about the stars with the 
use of his own telescope. At twelve, she aided her father in 
calculating the exact moment of an annular eclipse. And at 
seventeen, she opened her very own school for girls, where 
she taught them science and math. Mitchell rocketed to the 
forefront of American astronomy when she spotted a comet 
through her telescope. For her discovery of the comet, she 
received a gold medal as a recognition from King Frederick 
VII of Denmark. This gave her worldwide fame, since the 
only previous women to discover a comet were the 
astronomers Caroline Herschel and Maria Margarethe Kirch. 
In 1865 Mitchell became a faculty member at Vassar 
College, making her the first female astronomy professor in 
the United States.

Carlos Sanchez’s long­time friend, Frank Sandoval, had 
fallen on hard times and was about to lose ① his home. 
Frank’s wife was sick and their two small children were 
temporarily staying with his mother. Carlos hadn’t talked to 
Frank for several months and decided one day to call him 
and see how ② he was. When Frank confided in Carlos 
about his situation, Carlos immediately went to Frank’s 
home. When he walked in, ③ he was shocked to see his 
friend so thin and frail. He sat down with Frank and asked 
him how much money ④ he needed. Frank told him it was 
hopeless, that it was too much to pay back. Carlos pulled 
out his checkbook and wrote ⑤ him a check for fifty 
thousand dollars. He told Frank that things would get better
― and they did. Three years later, Frank paid Carlos back 
with interest.


33. While there is no denying that exceptional players like 
Emmitt Smith can put points on the board and enhance team 
success, new research suggests there is a limit to the 
benefit top talents bring to a team. Researchers compared 
the amount of individual talent on teams with the teams’ 
success, and they found striking examples of 
_________________________________________. The researchers 
looked at three sports: basketball, soccer, and baseball. In 
each sport, they calculated both the percentage of top talent 
on each team and the teams’ success over several years. 
For both basketball and soccer, they found that top talent 
did in fact predict team success, but only up to a point. 
Furthermore, there was not simply a point of diminishing 
returns with respect to top talent; there was in fact a cost. 
Basketball and soccer teams with the greatest proportion of 
elite athletes performed worse than those with more 
moderate proportions of top level players. [3점]
* diminishing returns: 수확 체감
① more talent hurting the team
② practice leading to perfection
③ top players being more cooperative
④ coaches being the key to team management
⑤ supporters interrupting the flow of the game

Healthy living in individuals lays the foundation for healthy 
living throughout society and the world. For instance, healthy 
relationships depend upon healthy individuals sharing 
personally and working mutually to develop win­win 
agreements on how to grow and maintain the relationship.  
(A)   , healthy parenting depends upon healthy parents. 
Children learn the foundations of how the world works and 
how to develop their personal reality relative to the 
consciousness and behaviors of their parents. They model 
and subconsciously embrace much of their parents’ behavior, 
so it becomes their own. Thus, the beliefs and behaviors of 
parents provide psychological and social information to the 
children that function almost like food does for the body; in 
this case, the information helps build their personal realities 
and shape their behaviors.    (B)   , psychological, social, 
as well as the physical diets provided by parents must all 
be healthy or the children learn to repeat the unhealthy 
patterns of their parents.

Gold is a relatively soft metal, so much so that rings 
are very rarely made from pure gold metal because they 
get scratched quickly.
(A) The answer is that they sit inside the gold crystal 
structure, taking the place of a gold atom, and it is this 
atom substitution inside the crystal lattice of the gold 
that makes it stronger.
(B) But if you alloy gold, by adding a small percentage of 
other metals such as silver or copper, you not only 
change the color of the gold — silver making the gold 
whiter, and copper making the gold redder — you make 
the gold harder, much harder. 
(C) This changing of the properties of metals by very small 
additions of other ingredients is what makes the study 
of metals so fascinating. In the case of gold alloys, you 
might wonder where the silver atoms go.

A female lawyer working for a prestigious New York 
law firm once accompanied the male CEO of a major 
client to Latin America to negotiate a complex deal.
(A) It was the local practice, the colleague suggested, for lawyers to negotiate only with other lawyers, not with 
the businesspeople. Had the woman lawyer insisted on 
participating, she would have spoiled the deal and 
destroyed her credibility.
(B) Before voicing her objections, however, she called a 
colleague back in New York, who told her that he, too, 
had been excluded from preliminary talks during his last 
negotiation in that country. The Latin American 
executive was just looking for a diplomatic way to get 
her out of the picture as a lawyer, not as a woman.
(C) Soon after they arrived, the head of the prospective 
Latin American partner suggested that he and the CEO 
go off together to discuss business ― while his wife and 
the lawyer go shopping. The lawyer was outraged, 
assuming this to be an example of Latin American 
gender bias.

People who struggle in retirement are those who still 
have a “get rich quick” mentality.
The most successful retirees are those who look at 
retirement as a long endeavor that can last 20 or 30 years 
or longer. ( ① ) They don’t throw all of their years of 
preparation away by investing in the next “hot stock” or 
investment idea. ( ② ) They’re very careful with their 
finances; they know they have to make sure that their 
money will last for the rest of their lives. ( ③ ) They stay 
conservative and focused on a finish line that is years and 
years away. ( ④ ) Even though they no longer have the 
comfort of a paycheck coming in, they still put their 
retirement nest egg at risk by chasing every hot tip that 
they get. ( ⑤ ) In other words, they are looking for short 
cuts to bring them financial stability and peace of mind.

However, during the same period, there has been no 
comparable worldwide advance in ethical behavior.
Over the past century, society has witnessed 
extraordinary advances in medicine, science, and technology. 
( ① ) These advances came about because an individual, or 
many individuals, used the full resources of his or her 
intellectual imagination to solve problems that had previously 
been thought to be unsolvable. ( ② ) That is, in part, 
because human beings rarely use the full resources of their 
intellect to solve moral problems. ( ③ ) Exercising moral 
imagination means using our intelligence to devise creative 
and innovative ways to help others. ( ④ ) Concerning 
charity, for example, it means not only providing immediate 
assistance to the impoverished, but also helping the poor in 
ways that will enable them to support themselves and no 
longer need help. ( ⑤ ) Therefore, in any situation in 
which help is required, we should use our intelligence to 
discover the most effective and loving way to help those in 
need. [3점]

By some estimates, music based on oral tradition had 
previously seldom been performed for more than one or two 
generations. ① By contrast, with the coming of records not 
only were the “classics” preserved, but formerly ephemeral 
“hits” could now survive as “oldies.” ② So the music of one 
generation’s youth could be replayed years later to evoke 
memories in some (often quite narrow) age group of people. 
③ Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms of course survived well 
beyond their social and cultural settings, taking on new 
meanings in the recordable world. ④ Bach mostly followed 
the complex rules of his day, while Beethoven challenged 
the rules, thus creating a new musical era. ⑤ Memories of 
falling in love or just being free and having fun also came to 
be linked to tunes that could be recalled or replayed again 
and again throughout life, thanks to the recording.

People tell about their own experiences all the time, 
but they do not necessarily tell about the same 
experience in the same way every time. The telling 
process, even in the relating of a firsthand experience, 
can be a highly inventive process. That is, the art of 
storytelling involves finding good ways to express one’s 
experiences in a way appropriate to the listener. A fine 
line exists, therefore, between invented stories and the 
relation of firsthand experiences. The entertainment 
factor exists in relating firsthand experiences just as it 
does in inventing stories. Nobody wants to listen to what 
happened to you today unless you can make what 
happened appear interesting. The process of livening up 
an experience can involve simply telling that experience 
in such a way as to eliminate the dullest parts, or it 
also can involve ‘improving’ the dull parts by playing 
with the facts.

Ta­Nahesi Coates, a senior editor at The Atlantic 
Monthly, ran a personal blog for years. Coates posts 
daily on a wide array of subjects: movies, politics, 
economic inequalities, the Civil War, TV shows, favorite 
poems, or whether pro football is too dangerous to play. 
Coates, who is African American, is also well known as 
an eloquent writer on race, and he posts about that 
frequently. Yet his blog is amazingly abuse­free: 
comments spill into the hundreds without going off the 
rails. “This is the most hot­button issue in America, and 
folks have managed to keep a fairly level head,” he says. 
The secret is the work Coates puts into his discussion 
board. Before he was a blogger himself, he’d noticed the 
terrible comments at his favorite political blogs. Coates 
realized that negative comments create a loop: they 
poison the atmosphere, chasing off productive posters. 
So when he started his own personal blog, he decided to 
break that loop. The instant he saw something abusive, 
he’d delete it, banning repeat offenders. Meanwhile, he 
went out of his way to encourage the smart folks, 
responding to them personally and publicly, so they’d be 
encouraged to stay and talk. And Coates was unfailingly 
polite and courteous himself, to help set community 
standards. Soon several dozen regular commenters 
emerged, and they got to know each other, talking as 
much to each other as to Coates. Their cohesion helped 
cement the culture of            even more; anyone 
today who looks at the blog can quickly tell this 
community isn’t going to tolerate nastiness.

The last Saturday of each month was always a highlight

sea looks calm. It might look like a perfect spot for 
fishing, but rocks that are too close to the water’s edge 
can be deceptively dangerous.
(B)
When he did so, he started catching really big fish ―
and his mom was delighted with the fresh fish she could 
cook for supper. Adrian gradually realized that it pays to 
listen to people with experience and knowledge of 
dangerous places. He also realized how stupid it was not 
to listen to his dad who gave (b) him precious advice free 
of charge!
(C)
On top of that, (c) he soon knew exactly how to make 
fishermen’s knots and how to untie tricky knots in his 
fishing lines. But Adrian wasn’t always keen to take his 
dad’s advice. When his dad showed him how to bait his 
hook, (d) he said that a little piece of the hook should 
always stick out, but Adrian thought otherwise. He 
thought it logical for the bait to hide the hook, so he 
ignored his dad ― but after quite a few days of catching 
nothing, decided to follow his dad’s advice.
(D)
Many careless fishermen had lost their lives on these 
rocks. Concrete crosses marked the spots where these 
people had been swept into the sea. Adrian had had a few 
narrow escapes when he had ventured too close to the 
edge. (e) He quickly learned to respect the mighty waters 
of the ocean. Adrian’s dad also taught him which kinds of 
bait were suitable for catching various kinds of fish, and 
he also learned which sinkers were right for the different 
fishing areas.
