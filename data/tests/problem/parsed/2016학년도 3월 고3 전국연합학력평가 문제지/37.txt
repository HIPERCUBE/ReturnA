People who struggle in retirement are those who still 
have a “get rich quick” mentality.
The most successful retirees are those who look at 
retirement as a long endeavor that can last 20 or 30 years 
or longer. ( ① ) They don’t throw all of their years of 
preparation away by investing in the next “hot stock” or 
investment idea. ( ② ) They’re very careful with their 
finances; they know they have to make sure that their 
money will last for the rest of their lives. ( ③ ) They stay 
conservative and focused on a finish line that is years and 
years away. ( ④ ) Even though they no longer have the 
comfort of a paycheck coming in, they still put their 
retirement nest egg at risk by chasing every hot tip that 
they get. ( ⑤ ) In other words, they are looking for short 
cuts to bring them financial stability and peace of mind.
