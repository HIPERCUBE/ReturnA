By some estimates, music based on oral tradition had 
previously seldom been performed for more than one or two 
generations. ① By contrast, with the coming of records not 
only were the “classics” preserved, but formerly ephemeral 
“hits” could now survive as “oldies.” ② So the music of one 
generation’s youth could be replayed years later to evoke 
memories in some (often quite narrow) age group of people. 
③ Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms of course survived well 
beyond their social and cultural settings, taking on new 
meanings in the recordable world. ④ Bach mostly followed 
the complex rules of his day, while Beethoven challenged 
the rules, thus creating a new musical era. ⑤ Memories of 
falling in love or just being free and having fun also came to 
be linked to tunes that could be recalled or replayed again 
and again throughout life, thanks to the recording.
