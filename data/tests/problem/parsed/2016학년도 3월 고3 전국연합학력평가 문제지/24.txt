24. Maria Mitchell에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Maria Mitchell was born on August 1, 1818, in Nantucket, 
Massachusetts. Her awareness for astronomy came to life 
when her father began to teach her about the stars with the 
use of his own telescope. At twelve, she aided her father in 
calculating the exact moment of an annular eclipse. And at 
seventeen, she opened her very own school for girls, where 
she taught them science and math. Mitchell rocketed to the 
forefront of American astronomy when she spotted a comet 
through her telescope. For her discovery of the comet, she 
received a gold medal as a recognition from King Frederick 
VII of Denmark. This gave her worldwide fame, since the 
only previous women to discover a comet were the 
astronomers Caroline Herschel and Maria Margarethe Kirch. 
In 1865 Mitchell became a faculty member at Vassar 
College, making her the first female astronomy professor in 
the United States.
