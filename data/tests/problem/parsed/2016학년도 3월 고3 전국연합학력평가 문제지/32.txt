32. History is a discipline. It is the art of __________________. 
As historian John Tosh writes, “All the resources of 
scholarship and all the historian’s powers of imagination 
must be harnessed to the task of bringing the past to life —
or resurrecting it.” The past is messy, but historians make 
sense of the mess by collecting evidence, making meaning of 
it, and organizing it into some kind of discernible pattern. 
History is an exciting act of interpretation — taking the facts 
of the past and weaving them into a compelling narrative. 
The historian works closely with the stuff that has been left 
behind — documents, oral testimony, objects — to make the 
past come alive. As John Arnold has noted, “The sources do 
not ‘speak for themselves’ and never have done so. . . . They 
come alive when the historian reanimates them.” [3점]
