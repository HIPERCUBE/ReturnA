Ta­Nahesi Coates, a senior editor at The Atlantic 
Monthly, ran a personal blog for years. Coates posts 
daily on a wide array of subjects: movies, politics, 
economic inequalities, the Civil War, TV shows, favorite 
poems, or whether pro football is too dangerous to play. 
Coates, who is African American, is also well known as 
an eloquent writer on race, and he posts about that 
frequently. Yet his blog is amazingly abuse­free: 
comments spill into the hundreds without going off the 
rails. “This is the most hot­button issue in America, and 
folks have managed to keep a fairly level head,” he says. 
The secret is the work Coates puts into his discussion 
board. Before he was a blogger himself, he’d noticed the 
terrible comments at his favorite political blogs. Coates 
realized that negative comments create a loop: they 
poison the atmosphere, chasing off productive posters. 
So when he started his own personal blog, he decided to 
break that loop. The instant he saw something abusive, 
he’d delete it, banning repeat offenders. Meanwhile, he 
went out of his way to encourage the smart folks, 
responding to them personally and publicly, so they’d be 
encouraged to stay and talk. And Coates was unfailingly 
polite and courteous himself, to help set community 
standards. Soon several dozen regular commenters 
emerged, and they got to know each other, talking as 
much to each other as to Coates. Their cohesion helped 
cement the culture of            even more; anyone 
today who looks at the blog can quickly tell this 
community isn’t going to tolerate nastiness.
