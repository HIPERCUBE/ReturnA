(A)
The last Saturday of each month was always a highlight 
in Adrian’s life. He and his dad had a regular fishing date. 
Adrian learned a lot about fishing and about life on these 
expeditions. (a) His father pointed out that there are some 
rocks that are too dangerous to go onto, even when the 
sea looks calm. It might look like a perfect spot for 
fishing, but rocks that are too close to the water’s edge 
can be deceptively dangerous.
(B)
When he did so, he started catching really big fish ―
and his mom was delighted with the fresh fish she could 
cook for supper. Adrian gradually realized that it pays to 
listen to people with experience and knowledge of 
dangerous places. He also realized how stupid it was not 
to listen to his dad who gave (b) him precious advice free 
of charge!
(C)
On top of that, (c) he soon knew exactly how to make 
fishermen’s knots and how to untie tricky knots in his 
fishing lines. But Adrian wasn’t always keen to take his 
dad’s advice. When his dad showed him how to bait his 
hook, (d) he said that a little piece of the hook should 
always stick out, but Adrian thought otherwise. He 
thought it logical for the bait to hide the hook, so he 
ignored his dad ― but after quite a few days of catching 
nothing, decided to follow his dad’s advice.
(D)
Many careless fishermen had lost their lives on these 
rocks. Concrete crosses marked the spots where these 
people had been swept into the sea. Adrian had had a few 
narrow escapes when he had ventured too close to the 
edge. (e) He quickly learned to respect the mighty waters 
of the ocean. Adrian’s dad also taught him which kinds of 
bait were suitable for catching various kinds of fish, and 
he also learned which sinkers were right for the different 
fishing areas.
* sinker: (낚싯줄의) 추, 봉돌
