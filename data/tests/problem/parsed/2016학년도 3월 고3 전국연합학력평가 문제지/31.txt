31. It takes time for water to soften a sponge. When you are 
telling an employee, lawn service worker, your teenager, or 
anyone else, what it is that you want them to do, you may

before the receiver really gets what it is you want done. 
That’s not bad. That’s normal communication lag. Be 
___________. When you are asking someone a question, in an 
effort to learn a fact that you feel is important for you to

answer, take it as a signal that you need to rephrase your 
question a little and repeat it again, and again, and again, 
until finally you are heard and answered.
