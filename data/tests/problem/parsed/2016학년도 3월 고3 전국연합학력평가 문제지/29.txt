The basic task of the preschool years is to establish a 
sense of competence and initiative. The core struggle is 
between initiative and guilt. Preschool children begin to 
initiate many of their own activities as they become 
physically and psychologically ready to engage in pursuits of 
their own ① choosing. If they are allowed realistic freedom 
to make some of their own decisions, they tend to develop a 
② positive orientation characterized by confidence in their 
ability to initiate and follow through. If their choices are 
ridiculed, however, they tend to experience a sense of guilt 
and ultimately to withdraw from taking an ③ active stance. 
One middle­aged woman we talked with still finds herself 
extremely vulnerable to being seen as ④ foolish. She recalls 
that during her childhood family members laughed at her 
attempts to perform certain tasks. She took in certain 
messages she received from her family, and these messages 
greatly influenced her attitudes and actions. Even now she 
vividly carries these pictures in her head, and these 
messages ⑤ cease to control her life.
