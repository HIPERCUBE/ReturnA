Gold is a relatively soft metal, so much so that rings 
are very rarely made from pure gold metal because they 
get scratched quickly.
(A) The answer is that they sit inside the gold crystal 
structure, taking the place of a gold atom, and it is this 
atom substitution inside the crystal lattice of the gold 
that makes it stronger.
(B) But if you alloy gold, by adding a small percentage of 
other metals such as silver or copper, you not only 
change the color of the gold — silver making the gold 
whiter, and copper making the gold redder — you make 
the gold harder, much harder. 
(C) This changing of the properties of metals by very small 
additions of other ingredients is what makes the study 
of metals so fascinating. In the case of gold alloys, you 
might wonder where the silver atoms go.
