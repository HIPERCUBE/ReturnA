Tradition is a critical element that cannot be ignored in 
the creation of architecture. Tradition is the essential 
element that allows a new work to connect with people on 
an emotional and intellectual level. The recollection of the 
familiar is one aspect of design that produces pleasure. This 
feeling of pleasure or satisfaction exists because we enjoy a 
sense of security among things that we know and 
understand. References to a previous tradition are a common 
component of most major architectural movements. While 
these movements utilized new technologies and building 
materials, or invented new building forms, each evoked an 
emotional response having its roots in an earlier tradition.
