Dear Ms. Brown,
We are thankful for the complimentary letter you 
have sent to us regarding our service. Letters like this 
keep us motivated and guide us to improve our 
service. We are pleased about your comment as 
customers’ satisfaction is the main motto of our 
service. It’s very rare that the customers take time to 
give thanks for the services, so we would like to use 
this letter as an example of the customer’s 
satisfactory remarks in our new brochure if you give 
us permission to do so. When people see such 
remarks from satisfied customers, they trust the 
service and products more. We hope you will help us 
in this regard. We will be contacting you soon to hear 
your decision regarding putting your remarks in the 
brochure.
Sincerely,
Oliver Watson
