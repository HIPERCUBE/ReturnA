22. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
There’s no subject you don’t have permission to write 
about. Students often avoid subjects close to their heart ―
skateboarding, cheerleading, rock music, cars ― because they 
assume that their teachers will regard these topics as 
‘stupid.’ No area of life is stupid to someone who takes it 
seriously. If you follow your affections, you will write well 
and will engage your readers. I’ve read elegant books on 
fishing, mountain climbing, giant sea turtles and many other 
subjects I didn’t think I was interested in. Write about your 
hobbies: cooking, gardening, photography, knitting, jogging, 
sailing, scuba diving. Write about your work: teaching, 
nursing, running a store. Write about a field you enjoyed in 
college and always meant to get back to: history, biography, 
art, archeology. No subject is too specialized if you make an 
honest connection with it when you write about it.
