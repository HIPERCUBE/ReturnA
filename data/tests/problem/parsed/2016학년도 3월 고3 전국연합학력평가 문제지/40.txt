People tell about their own experiences all the time, 
but they do not necessarily tell about the same 
experience in the same way every time. The telling 
process, even in the relating of a firsthand experience, 
can be a highly inventive process. That is, the art of 
storytelling involves finding good ways to express one’s 
experiences in a way appropriate to the listener. A fine 
line exists, therefore, between invented stories and the 
relation of firsthand experiences. The entertainment 
factor exists in relating firsthand experiences just as it 
does in inventing stories. Nobody wants to listen to what 
happened to you today unless you can make what 
happened appear interesting. The process of livening up 
an experience can involve simply telling that experience 
in such a way as to eliminate the dullest parts, or it 
also can involve ‘improving’ the dull parts by playing 
with the facts.
