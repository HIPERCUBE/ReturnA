29. Here are two multiplication problems; Question 1: What is the
product of 1×2×3×4×5×6×7×8? and Question 2: What is the
product of 8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1? Instead of calculating the
answer, take two or three seconds to make a rough estimate. If
we put these questions side by side, the numbers are the same.
So if we were truly logical beings our answer should be the same
for both. However, we are psychological beings so we take
shortcuts. When we are asked to answer the first question by
itself, the answers average about 500. But when the order of the
numbers is reversed, the answers average well above 2,000. In
the second problem, the product of the first three numbers is high,
and in the first it is low, resulting in hugely different projections.
This shows that .
