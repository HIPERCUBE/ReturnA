36. Five-Foot Shelf에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는것은?
Five-Foot Shelf, called Harvard Classics, is a 51-volume
collection of classic works from world literature, compiled and
edited by Harvard University president Charles W. Eliot.
Throughout his working at Harvard, Eliot had occasionally
remarked that a five-foot shelf would hold books enough to
give a good substitute of a liberal education. As he neared
retirement in 1909, one publisher invited him to compile this
Five-Foot Shelf. With the help of various professors at
Harvard, he completed the collection. He compiled the Classics
not as a “great books” collection but as a course of study
particularly for the young whose early education was cut short.
Unlike similar efforts, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica’s
Great Books, which have been updated and revised over the
years, the Harvard Classics were fixed once for all.
