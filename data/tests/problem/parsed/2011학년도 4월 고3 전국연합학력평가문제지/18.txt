Many city services will not open for some days because of
the budget problems of the city. As part of the 2011 budget,
three reduced-service days were planned for 2011, days which
are unpaid for all affected employees― the Friday after
Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and New Year’s Eve. If you plan
to check out a library book, visit a city clinic or have your
garbage picked up on those days, you had better choose another
day. City Hall, public libraries, health clinics and most city
offices will be closed. Emergency service providers including
police and fire fighters will be working at full strength, but most
services not directly related to public safety will not be
provided, including street sweeping. The 2011 budget
anticipates saving $8.3 million due to the reduced-service days.
