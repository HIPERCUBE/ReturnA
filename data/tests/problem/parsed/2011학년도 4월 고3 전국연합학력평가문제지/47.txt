Rudy Ruettiger came from a large blue-collar family. As a
kid, he had visions of being somebody. He wanted to do
heroic things, such as hitting a home run or going to
University of Notre Dame or, even better, playing football
there. But people would tell him, “You cannot do that. You
are not smart enough. You are not big enough.” School was
always difficult for him because he had difficulty in reading
and spelling. He thought that he could not learn at all, so he
had no hope of getting into any college.
