Although a fish does drink water, its primary method of
obtaining water is through osmosis. The water seeps into its
body through tiny holes in its skin. Osmosis is simply the
movement of a solution such as salt and water through a
membrane such as a fish’s skin until the concentration of the
solution becomes equal on both sides of the membrane.
When a fish lives in salt water, the ocean water contains
more salt than does the liquid in the fish. Thus, osmosis
draws water out of the fish and the fish needs continually to
drink water to refill the liquid being drawn out of its body.
When a fish lives in fresh water, the water has less salt than
does the liquid in the fish and water is drawn through the
fish’s skin into its body. Therefore, a freshwater fish does
not need to drink water.
*membrane: 세포막
A fish in salt water drinks water to (A) the
solution in and out of itself through osmosis, but there is
no (B) for a freshwater fish to drink water.

The of “learning” is “knowing!” Take a minute
and think about this thought. Knowing means that you will
not be looking at the assumptions that exist behind what you
think and know. It means that the thinking process leading to
knowing may never be revisited. The result could be a
persistent determination to hold onto a belief in spite of all
evidence that it should be changed. A “blind person” like this
chooses to reject all new evidence that could change his or
her knowing. He or she becomes stubborn. This blind
condition will prevent him or her from learning life’s lessons
that are necessary for personal growth.
What to do? A person growing in his or her personal
leadership will choose to become keen on his or her biases
and “knowing.” Recognizing that he or she has a knowing will
enable the person to open their minds to new facts, changes
in assumptions, and new evidence that their knowing may
need to be modified, changed, or let go. In this way, it is
possible to learn life’s lessons and grow as a person.
One thing we know is that we live in a world of rapidly
accelerating change. That tells me that we need to be open
to new information, ideas, and experiences so that we do not
become a “blind person.” What action or goal will you set for
yourself to more fully develop your openness to changing
your “knowing” and experience added personal growth?

(A)
Rudy Ruettiger came from a large blue-collar family. As a
kid, he had visions of being somebody. He wanted to do
heroic things, such as hitting a home run or going to
University of Notre Dame or, even better, playing football
there. But people would tell him, “You cannot do that. You
are not smart enough. You are not big enough.” School was
always difficult for him because he had difficulty in reading
and spelling. He thought that he could not learn at all, so he
had no hope of getting into any college.
(B)
(a) He knocked on the door of the faculty residence hall
and said, “Now, tell me how to get here.” The man who
answered the door was a priest who was the former
president of Notre Dame. He thought Rudy was distracted
but soon he realized that (b) he was a very passionate young
man filled with desire and determination. He called in other
priests to help Rudy. They helped him start the basic classes
there. Instead of people saying he could not do it, he had
people giving him a positive step he could make.
(C)
One day, one of his best friends gave him a Notre Dame
jacket saying, “You were born to wear this jacket.” He knew
Rudy’s dream was to go to Notre Dame. (c) He said to him,
“Life is too short to hold back on your dreams.” He realized
he had to get on with it. It took a lot of courage for him to
leave home without anyone’s help and move toward the
dream. But (d) he packed his bags and arrived at the
University of Notre Dame in the middle of the night.
(D)
This encouragement made it possible for him to do the hard
work he had not done before. They were not guaranteeing
anything, but they were making what had been impossible
possible. Eventually, (e) he ended up not only graduating
from the University of Notre Dame but also making the final
tackle as the last game of the season ended. As people
chanted “Ru-dy! Ru-dy!” he was carried off the field on the
shoulders of his teammates in triumphant glory.
