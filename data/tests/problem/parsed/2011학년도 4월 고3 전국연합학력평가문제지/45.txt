Although a fish does drink water, its primary method of
obtaining water is through osmosis. The water seeps into its
body through tiny holes in its skin. Osmosis is simply the
movement of a solution such as salt and water through a
membrane such as a fish’s skin until the concentration of the
solution becomes equal on both sides of the membrane.
When a fish lives in salt water, the ocean water contains
more salt than does the liquid in the fish. Thus, osmosis
draws water out of the fish and the fish needs continually to
drink water to refill the liquid being drawn out of its body.
When a fish lives in fresh water, the water has less salt than
does the liquid in the fish and water is drawn through the
fish’s skin into its body. Therefore, a freshwater fish does
not need to drink water.
