24. Some plants taste good and are easy to digest, while others are
slightly so. Many others are distasteful or even poisonous. Why?
Plants are products of millions of years of 　　　　　 .
Through all this time and even today, they are subject to many
influences including changes in climate, soil, and water;
competition from other plants; and the scores of plant-eating
animals. If a plant fails to adjust to these external influences,
the result can be serious depletion or even extinction of its
species. But, unlike animals, plants cannot pick up their roots
and race for safety. Nor have many plants taken the offensive
and become predators. So to defend themselves or ensure
survival of their species, most plants have developed elaborate
mechanical, chemical, and reproductive characteristics including
their distinctive tastes.
