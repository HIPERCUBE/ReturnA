One interesting example of self-control strategy imposed by
a government is daylight saving time. Most people think that
daylight saving time is a ① great idea, primarily because they
enjoy the extra hour of daylight during the evening. Of course,
the number of daylight hours on a given day is ② fixed. There
is just only one small but influential change. It is just to set the
clocks ahead one hour, which does nothing to ③ increase the
amount of daylight. The simple change of the labels on the
hours of the day, calling ‘six o’clock’ by the name ‘seven
o’clock,’ affects us all into waking up an hour ④ later. Along
with having more time to enjoy an evening, we end up saving
energy too. Historically, the idea was first suggested by
Benjamin Franklin as an American delegate in Paris. Known to
be stingy, Franklin calculated that thousands of pounds of
candle wax could be ⑤ saved with his idea.
