27. Leonardo’s famous painting the Mona Lisa in the Louvre
museum in Paris demands respect. We are expected to be in
awe of the original master and appreciate the art, the value and
the historical significance. Put a reproduction above your TV
and the image at a glance may appear remarkably similar to
that of the original, except that your wallpaper and your living
room now surround it. The great work of art is deprived of its
presentation and its relationship with the other great works of
art it once shared its room with. The expectations for us to
look carefully with admiration and appreciation are removed.
The context in which we see an image makes a significant
difference to how we respond to the image. When we present
an image for discussion we must remember that we have
removed it from its original context. The original context is
therefore that should be recorded
in your background work or research. [3점]
