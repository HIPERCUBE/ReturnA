40. We cannot read with our eyes immobilized and our mind
asleep. Many people suppose that the writer must put out some
effort, but no work needs to be done by the reader. The
mistake here is to suppose that receiving communication is like
receiving a legacy passively. On the contrary, there can be no
absolutely passive reading. The reader is like the catcher in a
game of baseball. Catching the ball is just as much an activity
as pitching it. The pitcher is the sender in the sense that his
activity initiates the motion of the ball. The catcher is the
receiver in that his activity terminates it. Both are active,
though the actions are different. If anything is passive, it is the
ball itself, whereas the players are active, moving to pitch or
catch. The analogy with writing and reading is almost perfect.
