35. We all worry about getting old. We all worry about getting
sick. But we really worry about losing our minds. Yes, the brain
at middle age has lost a step. Our problems are not imaginary,
and our worries are not unreasonable. But neuroscientists have
found that the middle-aged brain actually has surprising
talents. It has developed powerful systems that can cut through
the intricacies of complex problems to find concrete answers.
It more calmly manages emotions and information than in
younger years. Indeed, one new series of fascinating studies
suggests that the way our brains age may give us a broader
perspective, and even be more creative. Older brains are also
better at making connections. Yes, the old take longer to
assimilate new information. But faced with information that
relates to what they already know, their brains tend to work
quicker and smarter, discerning patterns and jumping to the
logical end point.
