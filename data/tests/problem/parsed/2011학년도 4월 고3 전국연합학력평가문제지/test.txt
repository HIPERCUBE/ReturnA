Many city services will not open for some days because of
the budget problems of the city. As part of the 2011 budget,
three reduced-service days were planned for 2011, days which
are unpaid for all affected employees― the Friday after
Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and New Year’s Eve. If you plan
to check out a library book, visit a city clinic or have your
garbage picked up on those days, you had better choose another
day. City Hall, public libraries, health clinics and most city
offices will be closed. Emergency service providers including
police and fire fighters will be working at full strength, but most
services not directly related to public safety will not be
provided, including street sweeping. The 2011 budget
anticipates saving $8.3 million due to the reduced-service days.

One evening before making a presentation at a sales
conference, Mark discovered that he and the vice president of
sales for a large food products firm were both car lovers. “Do
you read Car Weekly?” the vice president asked. At the time
Mark was not familiar with the publication, but ① he was
curious about it. After the vice president told him about the
magazine,　 ② he made a mental note to subscribe to it.
However, his fellow car lover was one step ahead. The next
morning,　 ③ he handed him a subscription card that he had
pulled out of his most recent issue. Mark was struck by how
thoughtful this small gesture was. After that,　 ④ he uses a
similar technique when he talks with friends and clients about
books. If　⑤ he finds out that there is a really great title they
have not read, he will order a copy and have it sent to them. He
believes that this simple act is effective for relationship building.

Most of us make at least three important decisions in our
lives: where to live, what to do, and whom to do it with. We
choose our towns, our jobs, and our spouses and friends. Making
these decisions ① is such a natural part of adulthood that it is
easy to forget that we are among the first human beings to
make them. For most of recorded history, people lived ②where
they were born, did what their parents had done, and associated
with those who were doing the same. Social and physical
structures were the great dictators ③ that determined how and
where people would spend their lives. This left most folks with
little to decide for ④ themselves. But the industrial and
technological revolutions changed all that, and the resulting
explosion of personal liberty ⑤ creating an array of options,
alternatives, and decisions that our ancestors never faced.

People avoid feedback because they hate being criticized.
Psychologists have a lot of theories about why people are so
(A) sensitive / sensitively to hearing about their own imperfections.
One is that they associate feedback with the critical comments
received in their younger years from parents and teachers.
(B) What /Whatever the cause of our discomfort is, most of us
have to train ourselves to seek feedback and listen carefully
when we hear it. Without that training, the very threat of
critical feedback often leads us to (C) practice / be practiced
destructive, maladaptive behaviors that negatively affect not
only our work but the overall health of our organizations.
(A) (B) (C)
① sensitive …… Whatever …… practice
② sensitive …… Whatever …… be practiced
③ sensitive …… What …… practice
④ sensitively …… Whatever …… practice
⑤ sensitively …… What …… be practiced

A Spanish language school created in Guatemalan village in
1996 offers an example of how tourism can contribute to
conservation. ①The school combines individual language
courses with homestay opportunities and eco-tours.　 ② It
receives around 1,800 tourists yearly and employs almost 100
residents, of whom around 60 percent were previously engaged
in mostly illegal timber extraction and hunting. ③ Careful
monitoring in 2000 has shown that, among the families benefiting
from the business, the majority has significantly reduced old
practices which damaged the environment.　④Numerous animal
and plant species may become extinct soon because of luxury
tourism.　⑤ Furthermore, community-owned private reserves
have been established, and social pressure against hunting has
increased.

No one can overestimate the grave consequences of the
soaring population of senior citizens. Now more and more
elderly people find it difficult to lead a decent life due mainly to
financial hardship. That is, poverty is posing a major challenge
to them. The nation’s welfare budget for the elderly represents
only 16.8 percent of the total welfare spending, hitting the
second lowest among the OECD states. The statistics show
how vulnerable senior citizens are to poverty. It is necessary
for the government to make a sufficient welfare budget for the
elderly. Otherwise, the government cannot avoid criticism that
it has done little to tackle the worsening problem. It is time for
the government to try to increase the welfare spending for the
elderly hit by poverty.

[24 ~ 29] 다음글의빈칸에들어갈말로가장적절한것을고르시오.
24. Some plants taste good and are easy to digest, while others are
slightly so. Many others are distasteful or even poisonous. Why?
Plants are products of millions of years of 　　　　　 .
Through all this time and even today, they are subject to many
influences including changes in climate, soil, and water;
competition from other plants; and the scores of plant-eating
animals. If a plant fails to adjust to these external influences,
the result can be serious depletion or even extinction of its
species. But, unlike animals, plants cannot pick up their roots
and race for safety. Nor have many plants taken the offensive
and become predators. So to defend themselves or ensure
survival of their species, most plants have developed elaborate
mechanical, chemical, and reproductive characteristics including
their distinctive tastes.
① isolation ② adaptation ③ combination
④ contraction ⑤ simplification
25. I think that, in general, there is too much respect paid to the
opinions of others, both in great matters and in small ones.
Take, for example, the matter of expenditure. Very many
people spend money in ways quite different from those that
their natural tastes would demand. They feel that the respect
of their neighbors depends on their possession of a good car
and their ability to give good dinners. However, to be actually
indifferent to is both a strength and
a source of happiness. A society composed of those who do not
bow too much to the cheering crowd is far more interesting and
desirable than one in which all behave alike. People should be
natural, and should follow their spontaneous tastes in so far as
these are not definitely antisocial.
① the public opinion ② the natural flavor
③ the antisocial attitude ④ the consumer pressure
⑤ the political correctness
26. When you feel a strong emotion, you are inclined to do
something vigorously. If you are afraid, you want to run away; if
you are angry, you want to attack. If you are extremely joyful,
your response is less predictable but usually vigorous. However,
you sometimes feel a strong emotion without this vigorous
action. Even in this case, there is still in
your mind. Consider this situation. You are lying in bed when
you hear an intruder break into the house. You might lie there
frozen with fear, feeling a strong emotion but doing nothing.
True, you are not moving, but your heart is racing. You might
continue lying there, hoping the intruder will leave without
noticing you, but you are ready to run away or attack or do
whatever else becomes necessary.
①much violation of privacy ② some readiness for action
③ slim chance of meditation ④ unwanted pressure of attack
⑤ natural instinct for freedom
27. Leonardo’s famous painting the Mona Lisa in the Louvre
museum in Paris demands respect. We are expected to be in
awe of the original master and appreciate the art, the value and
the historical significance. Put a reproduction above your TV
and the image at a glance may appear remarkably similar to
that of the original, except that your wallpaper and your living
room now surround it. The great work of art is deprived of its
presentation and its relationship with the other great works of
art it once shared its room with. The expectations for us to
look carefully with admiration and appreciation are removed.
The context in which we see an image makes a significant
difference to how we respond to the image. When we present
an image for discussion we must remember that we have
removed it from its original context. The original context is
therefore that should be recorded
in your background work or research. [3점]
① a possible substitute of study
② a false image of masterpieces
③ an original source of mistakes
④ a similar presentation of images
⑤ an important frame of reference
28. One of themost important factors that influences an organization’s
response to its external environment is its culture. Organization
culture is the set of important assumptions about the organization
and its goals and practices that members of the company share. In
this way, company’s culture provides a framework that organizes
and directs people’s behavior on the job. Thus, the culture of an
organization . For example,
the way people dress and behave, the way they interact with
each other and with customers, and the qualities that are likely
to be valued by their managers are usually quite different at a
bank than they are at a rock-music company, and different
again at a law firm or an advertising agency.
① becomes easily ignored by people
② aligns with the cooperative environment
③ promotes members’ loyalty to the group
④ shows variety depending on the workplace
⑤ influences the relationship between members
29. Here are two multiplication problems; Question 1: What is the
product of 1×2×3×4×5×6×7×8? and Question 2: What is the
product of 8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1? Instead of calculating the
answer, take two or three seconds to make a rough estimate. If
we put these questions side by side, the numbers are the same.
So if we were truly logical beings our answer should be the same
for both. However, we are psychological beings so we take
shortcuts. When we are asked to answer the first question by
itself, the answers average about 500. But when the order of the
numbers is reversed, the answers average well above 2,000. In
the second problem, the product of the first three numbers is high,
and in the first it is low, resulting in hugely different projections.
This shows that .

① the way we avoid problems controls the way we think
② the attention-grabbing effort has a good result on life
③ the first information has a large influence on what follows
④ the close observation of the result makes right judgement
⑤ the answer to the first question misleads the next question

My husband is a busy physician. He rarely has dinner with us.
However, this afternoon he called me and said he would come
back home earlier after finishing the last operation. He also
asked me not to call while he was operating. After hanging up
the phone, I was in a rush to get dinner ready letting my baby
girl play with her new favorite toy, my cellular phone. After a
while, I heard my phone ring. I tried to take the phone away
from my baby girl, but she hung it up. The phone rang again
and I answered. A nurse’s voice said that my husband wanted
to know why I called so many times and see if there was an
emergency. I could not understand what was going on, so I
checked the call log. I was at a loss to find out that my baby
girl had dialed her father six times in about five minutes.

31. (A)~(C)에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말을바르게짝지은것은?
Some families work better together if there is a set of house
rules. These (A) prohibit / prescribe the expectations for behaviors
and guidelines for the family to live together as a group.
Well-defined house rules can become quite important during
the adolescent years. Having these rules discussed and
written down can avoid conflicts over what behaviors are
acceptable. When there is a particular problem in following a
rule, then the parents may want to implement associated
consequences if the rule is (B) broken / obeyed . However, the
rules should be fair and consistent and should involve input
from the teen. Adolescents may be eager to participate in the
(C) abolishment / establishment of such rules when they find
out that they might include a rule they like such as, “No one
will enter someone else’s room without knocking first.” Rules
are mainly needed for teen or family member behaviors that
are a problem.
(A) (B) (C)
① prohibit …… obeyed …… abolishment
② prohibit …… broken …… establishment
③ prescribe …… broken …… abolishment
④ prescribe …… obeyed …… abolishment
⑤ prescribe …… broken …… establishment

One interesting example of self-control strategy imposed by
a government is daylight saving time. Most people think that
daylight saving time is a ① great idea, primarily because they
enjoy the extra hour of daylight during the evening. Of course,
the number of daylight hours on a given day is ② fixed. There
is just only one small but influential change. It is just to set the
clocks ahead one hour, which does nothing to ③ increase the
amount of daylight. The simple change of the labels on the
hours of the day, calling ‘six o’clock’ by the name ‘seven
o’clock,’ affects us all into waking up an hour ④ later. Along
with having more time to enjoy an evening, we end up saving
energy too. Historically, the idea was first suggested by
Benjamin Franklin as an American delegate in Paris. Known to
be stingy, Franklin calculated that thousands of pounds of
candle wax could be ⑤ saved with his idea.

The battle to minimize the surface is something we see all
over the natural world. For example, groups of newborn
birds and animals huddle together into a ball minimizing
exposed surface so as to keep them warm. (A) ,
the members of a herd of cattle or a school of fish seeking to
minimize the opportunities for predators will gather themselves
into a circular group to minimize the surface that the
predator can attack. When it is dry, the cactus contracts like
an accordion to minimize the surface area exposed to the sun
and retain as much water as possible. (B) , there are
many situations where a large surface area is important. For
a tree that draws moisture and nutrients from the air, it is
good to maximize its surface area with lots of leafy surfaces.
(A) (B)
① Instead …… In contrast
② Besides …… Consequently
③ However …… Otherwise
④ Likewise …… Conversely

34. Many studies show that a lack of knowledge about nutrition
leads to unhealthy eating habits and obesity in the young.
Moreover, with the increasing number of dual-income families,
parents are finding it more difficult to teach their children how
to eat well. To fill the gap, governments need to put the emphasis
on nutrition education in the classroom. The aim of this education
should be to teach young students how to eat more healthily.
Young students need to have a better relationship with food,
learning about what is on their plate and how it gets there.
With this education young children can get interested in what
they are eating and break bad eating habits. Nutrition education
in schools can help more students eat balanced diets that
include more vegetables and have a healthy life.

① the need for nutrition education in schools
② the absence of education about health care
③ the relationship between food and health
④ disadvantages of unhealthy eating habits
⑤ tips for parents to keep children safe
35. We all worry about getting old. We all worry about getting
sick. But we really worry about losing our minds. Yes, the brain
at middle age has lost a step. Our problems are not imaginary,
and our worries are not unreasonable. But neuroscientists have
found that the middle-aged brain actually has surprising
talents. It has developed powerful systems that can cut through
the intricacies of complex problems to find concrete answers.
It more calmly manages emotions and information than in
younger years. Indeed, one new series of fascinating studies
suggests that the way our brains age may give us a broader
perspective, and even be more creative. Older brains are also
better at making connections. Yes, the old take longer to
assimilate new information. But faced with information that
relates to what they already know, their brains tend to work
quicker and smarter, discerning patterns and jumping to the
logical end point.
①ways to delay brain aging
② the problems of getting old
③ benefits of the brain with aging
④ effects of exercise on creativity
⑤ the importance of logical thinking
36. Five-Foot Shelf에 대한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는것은?
Five-Foot Shelf, called Harvard Classics, is a 51-volume
collection of classic works from world literature, compiled and
edited by Harvard University president Charles W. Eliot.
Throughout his working at Harvard, Eliot had occasionally
remarked that a five-foot shelf would hold books enough to
give a good substitute of a liberal education. As he neared
retirement in 1909, one publisher invited him to compile this
Five-Foot Shelf. With the help of various professors at
Harvard, he completed the collection. He compiled the Classics
not as a “great books” collection but as a course of study
particularly for the young whose early education was cut short.
Unlike similar efforts, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica’s
Great Books, which have been updated and revised over the
years, the Harvard Classics were fixed once for all.

The National Zoological Gardens is the largest in South Africa
and is regarded as one of the top zoos in the world. Established
in 1899, the grounds cover an area of 75 hectares. The main
functions of the zoo are conservation, education, research and
the recreational needs of its visitors. It has over 200 mammals
and 80 bird species, of which about 70 are classified as highly
endangered. Apart from its enclosures, which are designed to
resemble the animals’ natural habitat, there is an animal
nursery, veterinary hospital and farmyard area. The zoo has an
education program, which includes courses for adults and for
school children during school holidays. Facilities include
cable-car rides commanding a superb view over the zoo, a train
which transports people to the different sections of the zoo, a
restaurant, a conference facility, a souvenir shop, and picnic
facilities.

38. A few years ago, a university professor tried a little but
impressive experiment. He sent Christmas cards to a sample of
perfect strangers. Although he expected some reaction, the
response he received was amazing. Holiday cards addressed to
him came pouring back from the people who had never met nor
heard of him. The great majority of those who returned a card
never inquired into the identity of the unknown professor. They
received his holiday greeting card, and they automatically sent
one in return. While small in scope, this study nicely shows one
action of the most potent weapons to influence our behavior.
That is the rule for mutuality. The rule says that we should try
to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.

39. Over the last fifty years computer modeling has become a
central part of scientific research. With this, scientists can predict
earthquakes, how disease spreads, and many other complex
phenomena. However, it is just an aid to scientists for calculating
predictions from their theories. Experiments will always be
necessary to test these predictions against reality. Computer
modeling is like a sophisticated way of using pen and paper to
calculate the predictions of a scientific theory. Computers may
yield important predictions about complex phenomena, but the
predictions they make can never be relied on without
experimental confirmation. After the computer has made its
predictions, these should be compared with scientific experiments.

40. We cannot read with our eyes immobilized and our mind
asleep. Many people suppose that the writer must put out some
effort, but no work needs to be done by the reader. The
mistake here is to suppose that receiving communication is like
receiving a legacy passively. On the contrary, there can be no
absolutely passive reading. The reader is like the catcher in a
game of baseball. Catching the ball is just as much an activity
as pitching it. The pitcher is the sender in the sense that his
activity initiates the motion of the ball. The catcher is the
receiver in that his activity terminates it. Both are active,
though the actions are different. If anything is passive, it is the
ball itself, whereas the players are active, moving to pitch or
catch. The analogy with writing and reading is almost perfect.
①What Disturbs Your Reading?
② Reading: Just a Passive Activity?
③ Effective Strategies in Fast Reading
④ Interactions: What Matters in Baseball
⑤ Initiating and Terminating Communication
41. Today, employers are increasingly confronted with the
problem of retaining talented personnel. The management
should expend time and effort in devising ways to reduce
employee turnover. Most of all, the policies of an organization
should be employee-oriented. This can be achieved by
conducting open-door meetings and encouraging staff
participation in making important decisions. Another important
method to help reduce turnover is by hiring the right people for
the job. It is the responsibility of the management team to
conduct thorough research of the candidate before recruitment.
Though money is not the only reason for high conflict, a
competitive pay could go a long way in motivating an employee.
Competent staff expect their pay to be on par with their peers
working in other organizations. It should also be ensured that
employees are not overworked.
①When to Transfer Your Position
② How to Stop Employee Turnover
③ Absolute Advantages of Job Change
④ Encouraging Employee Performance
⑤ Competitiveness of Powerful Management

present-day scientists search for patterns and trends in
natural phenomena.
(A) This cycle consists of 235 lunar periods and is the point
where both the solar and lunar years are harmonized. They
also acquired a vast amount of astrological information from
the Babylonians.
(B) In fact, ancient Chinese astronomers were keen observers of
the skies, and they made some of the earliest astronomical
accomplishments. One of them was their calculation of “the
cycle of nineteen years.”
(C) The information enabled them to develop a cycle to predict
both lunar and solar eclipses and instruments to measure the
movement of heavenly bodies― at least 500 years before
the west accomplished the same tasks.

On the other hand, those who are emotionally illiterate
blunder their way through lives marked by misunderstanding,
frustrations, and failed relationships.
What is the secret of human happiness and fulfillment? Philosophers,
prophets, and other sages have debated this question since ancient
times without arriving at a satisfactory resolution. ( ① ) The
advance of psychology in the last century has raised the hope of a
scientific answer to the secret. ( ② ) Perhaps, in psychological
view, systematic, empirical study of human success and failure will
tell us how we should live. ( ③ ) Recently psychological
experiments showed that understanding the emotions of oneself
and others is the key to a satisfying life. ( ④ ) For example,
those people who are self-aware and responsive to others
manage their affairs with wisdom and grace, even in adverse
circumstances. ( ⑤ ) A scientific understanding of this emotional
intelligence may allow us to train our emotional skills so that we
can live more fulfilling and productive lives.

Although a fish does drink water, its primary method of
obtaining water is through osmosis. The water seeps into its
body through tiny holes in its skin. Osmosis is simply the
movement of a solution such as salt and water through a
membrane such as a fish’s skin until the concentration of the
solution becomes equal on both sides of the membrane.
When a fish lives in salt water, the ocean water contains
more salt than does the liquid in the fish. Thus, osmosis
draws water out of the fish and the fish needs continually to
drink water to refill the liquid being drawn out of its body.
When a fish lives in fresh water, the water has less salt than
does the liquid in the fish and water is drawn through the
fish’s skin into its body. Therefore, a freshwater fish does
not need to drink water.
*membrane: 세포막
A fish in salt water drinks water to (A) the
solution in and out of itself through osmosis, but there is
no (B) for a freshwater fish to drink water.

The of “learning” is “knowing!” Take a minute
and think about this thought. Knowing means that you will
not be looking at the assumptions that exist behind what you
think and know. It means that the thinking process leading to
knowing may never be revisited. The result could be a
persistent determination to hold onto a belief in spite of all
evidence that it should be changed. A “blind person” like this
chooses to reject all new evidence that could change his or
her knowing. He or she becomes stubborn. This blind
condition will prevent him or her from learning life’s lessons
that are necessary for personal growth.
What to do? A person growing in his or her personal
leadership will choose to become keen on his or her biases
and “knowing.” Recognizing that he or she has a knowing will
enable the person to open their minds to new facts, changes
in assumptions, and new evidence that their knowing may
need to be modified, changed, or let go. In this way, it is
possible to learn life’s lessons and grow as a person.
One thing we know is that we live in a world of rapidly
accelerating change. That tells me that we need to be open
to new information, ideas, and experiences so that we do not
become a “blind person.” What action or goal will you set for
yourself to more fully develop your openness to changing
your “knowing” and experience added personal growth?

(A)
Rudy Ruettiger came from a large blue-collar family. As a
kid, he had visions of being somebody. He wanted to do
heroic things, such as hitting a home run or going to
University of Notre Dame or, even better, playing football
there. But people would tell him, “You cannot do that. You
are not smart enough. You are not big enough.” School was
always difficult for him because he had difficulty in reading
and spelling. He thought that he could not learn at all, so he
had no hope of getting into any college.

(B)
(a) He knocked on the door of the faculty residence hall
and said, “Now, tell me how to get here.” The man who
answered the door was a priest who was the former
president of Notre Dame. He thought Rudy was distracted
but soon he realized that (b) he was a very passionate young
man filled with desire and determination. He called in other
priests to help Rudy. They helped him start the basic classes
there. Instead of people saying he could not do it, he had
people giving him a positive step he could make.
(C)
One day, one of his best friends gave him a Notre Dame
jacket saying, “You were born to wear this jacket.” He knew
Rudy’s dream was to go to Notre Dame. (c) He said to him,
“Life is too short to hold back on your dreams.” He realized
he had to get on with it. It took a lot of courage for him to
leave home without anyone’s help and move toward the
dream. But (d) he packed his bags and arrived at the
University of Notre Dame in the middle of the night.
(D)
This encouragement made it possible for him to do the hard
work he had not done before. They were not guaranteeing
anything, but they were making what had been impossible
possible. Eventually, (e) he ended up not only graduating
from the University of Notre Dame but also making the final
tackle as the last game of the season ended. As people
chanted “Ru-dy! Ru-dy!” he was carried off the field on the
shoulders of his teammates in triumphant glory.
