The graph above shows the production of sustainable energy in
Korea from four different sources from 2003 to 2008. ① Since
2003, production of the energy from wind power increased and it
exceeded 90,000 toe in 2008. ② Production of the energy from
solar thermal power was at its peak in 2004, and then decreased
steadily.③ In 2008, production of the energy from solar photovoltaic
power was less than twice as much as that of the energy from solar
thermal power. ④The gap between production of the energy
from solar photovoltaic power and production of the energy from
geothermal power wasbiggest in 2008. ⑤Production of the energy
from three sources except the solar thermal power increased
from 2003 to 2008.
