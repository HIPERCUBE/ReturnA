(A)
Rudy Ruettiger came from a large blue-collar family. As a
kid, he had visions of being somebody. He wanted to do
heroic things, such as hitting a home run or going to
University of Notre Dame or, even better, playing football
there. But people would tell him, “You cannot do that. You
are not smart enough. You are not big enough.” School was
always difficult for him because he had difficulty in reading
and spelling. He thought that he could not learn at all, so he
had no hope of getting into any college.
(B)
(a) He knocked on the door of the faculty residence hall
and said, “Now, tell me how to get here.” The man who
answered the door was a priest who was the former
president of Notre Dame. He thought Rudy was distracted
but soon he realized that (b) he was a very passionate young
man filled with desire and determination. He called in other
priests to help Rudy. They helped him start the basic classes
there. Instead of people saying he could not do it, he had
people giving him a positive step he could make.
(C)
One day, one of his best friends gave him a Notre Dame
jacket saying, “You were born to wear this jacket.” He knew
Rudy’s dream was to go to Notre Dame. (c) He said to him,
“Life is too short to hold back on your dreams.” He realized
he had to get on with it. It took a lot of courage for him to
leave home without anyone’s help and move toward the
dream. But (d) he packed his bags and arrived at the
University of Notre Dame in the middle of the night.
(D)
This encouragement made it possible for him to do the hard
work he had not done before. They were not guaranteeing
anything, but they were making what had been impossible
possible. Eventually, (e) he ended up not only graduating
from the University of Notre Dame but also making the final
tackle as the last game of the season ended. As people
chanted “Ru-dy! Ru-dy!” he was carried off the field on the
shoulders of his teammates in triumphant glory.
