My husband is a busy physician. He rarely has dinner with us.
However, this afternoon he called me and said he would come
back home earlier after finishing the last operation. He also
asked me not to call while he was operating. After hanging up
the phone, I was in a rush to get dinner ready letting my baby
girl play with her new favorite toy, my cellular phone. After a
while, I heard my phone ring. I tried to take the phone away
from my baby girl, but she hung it up. The phone rang again
and I answered. A nurse’s voice said that my husband wanted
to know why I called so many times and see if there was an
emergency. I could not understand what was going on, so I
checked the call log. I was at a loss to find out that my baby
girl had dialed her father six times in about five minutes.
