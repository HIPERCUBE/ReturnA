34. Many studies show that a lack of knowledge about nutrition
leads to unhealthy eating habits and obesity in the young.
Moreover, with the increasing number of dual-income families,
parents are finding it more difficult to teach their children how
to eat well. To fill the gap, governments need to put the emphasis
on nutrition education in the classroom. The aim of this education
should be to teach young students how to eat more healthily.
Young students need to have a better relationship with food,
learning about what is on their plate and how it gets there.
With this education young children can get interested in what
they are eating and break bad eating habits. Nutrition education
in schools can help more students eat balanced diets that
include more vegetables and have a healthy life.
