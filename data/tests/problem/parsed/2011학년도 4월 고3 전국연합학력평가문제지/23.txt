No one can overestimate the grave consequences of the
soaring population of senior citizens. Now more and more
elderly people find it difficult to lead a decent life due mainly to
financial hardship. That is, poverty is posing a major challenge
to them. The nation’s welfare budget for the elderly represents
only 16.8 percent of the total welfare spending, hitting the
second lowest among the OECD states. The statistics show
how vulnerable senior citizens are to poverty. It is necessary
for the government to make a sufficient welfare budget for the
elderly. Otherwise, the government cannot avoid criticism that
it has done little to tackle the worsening problem. It is time for
the government to try to increase the welfare spending for the
elderly hit by poverty.
