Most of us make at least three important decisions in our
lives: where to live, what to do, and whom to do it with. We
choose our towns, our jobs, and our spouses and friends. Making
these decisions ① is such a natural part of adulthood that it is
easy to forget that we are among the first human beings to
make them. For most of recorded history, people lived ②where
they were born, did what their parents had done, and associated
with those who were doing the same. Social and physical
structures were the great dictators ③ that determined how and
where people would spend their lives. This left most folks with
little to decide for ④ themselves. But the industrial and
technological revolutions changed all that, and the resulting
explosion of personal liberty ⑤ creating an array of options,
alternatives, and decisions that our ancestors never faced.
