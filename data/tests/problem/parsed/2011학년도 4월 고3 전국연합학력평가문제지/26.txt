26. When you feel a strong emotion, you are inclined to do
something vigorously. If you are afraid, you want to run away; if
you are angry, you want to attack. If you are extremely joyful,
your response is less predictable but usually vigorous. However,
you sometimes feel a strong emotion without this vigorous
action. Even in this case, there is still in
your mind. Consider this situation. You are lying in bed when
you hear an intruder break into the house. You might lie there
frozen with fear, feeling a strong emotion but doing nothing.
True, you are not moving, but your heart is racing. You might
continue lying there, hoping the intruder will leave without
noticing you, but you are ready to run away or attack or do
whatever else becomes necessary.
