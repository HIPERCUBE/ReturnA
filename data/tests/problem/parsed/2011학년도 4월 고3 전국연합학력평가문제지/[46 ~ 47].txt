The of “learning” is “knowing!” Take a minute
and think about this thought. Knowing means that you will
not be looking at the assumptions that exist behind what you
think and know. It means that the thinking process leading to
knowing may never be revisited. The result could be a
persistent determination to hold onto a belief in spite of all
evidence that it should be changed. A “blind person” like this
chooses to reject all new evidence that could change his or
her knowing. He or she becomes stubborn. This blind
condition will prevent him or her from learning life’s lessons
that are necessary for personal growth.
What to do? A person growing in his or her personal
leadership will choose to become keen on his or her biases
and “knowing.” Recognizing that he or she has a knowing will
enable the person to open their minds to new facts, changes
in assumptions, and new evidence that their knowing may
need to be modified, changed, or let go. In this way, it is
possible to learn life’s lessons and grow as a person.
One thing we know is that we live in a world of rapidly
accelerating change. That tells me that we need to be open
to new information, ideas, and experiences so that we do not
become a “blind person.” What action or goal will you set for
yourself to more fully develop your openness to changing
your “knowing” and experience added personal growth?
