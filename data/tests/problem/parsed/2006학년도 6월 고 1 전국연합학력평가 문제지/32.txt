Italy is one of the countries with a lower birth rate in the
world. Its lower birth rate has several causes. One cause is
that in the 1970s an increase of ① unemployment left people
feeling financially insecure. They chose to have ② fewer
children. Another cause is that more people moved from rural
to urban areas. The cost of living and raising children in the
city was ③ lower, so people didn't have many children. The
third reason is that ④more women now have careers outside
of the home. The final reason is that many adults want a
lifestyle that they can enjoy themselves in ⑤ small families.
