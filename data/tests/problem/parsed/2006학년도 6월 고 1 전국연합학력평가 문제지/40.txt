것은?
In the United States, people enjoy entertaining at home. They
often invite friends over for a meal or a party. When people
invite someone they say like this: “Would you like to come
over for dinner this Friday?” Sometimes, however, people use
expressions that sound like invitations but which are not real
invitations. ( A ) , someone may say, “Please come over for
a meal sometime.” or “Let's get together for lunch soon.” These
are really just polite ways of ending a conversation. They are
not real invitations because they don't mention a specific time
or date. They just show that the person is trying to be
friendly. ( B ) , next time you hear what sounds like an
invitation, listen carefully. Is it a real invitation or is the person
just being friendly?
(A) (B)
① For instance ----- Therefore
② Besides ----- However
③ On the contrary ----- In addition
④ Above all ----- Nevertheless
⑤ In other words ----- Moreover
