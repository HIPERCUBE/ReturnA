39. ‘ I ’에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Here I am! I traveled yesterday for four hours in a train. It's
a funny feeling because I never rode in one before. College is
the biggest, strangest place, so I get lost whenever I leave my
room. I will write you a description later when I'm feeling less
mixed-up. My classes don't begin until Monday morning, and
this is Saturday night. But I wanted to write a letter first, just
to make friends with you. It seems strange to write letters to
someone you don't know. It seems strange for me to write
letters at all―I've never written more than three or four in my
life.
