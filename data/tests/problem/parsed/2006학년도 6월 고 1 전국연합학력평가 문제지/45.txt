others, it means making activities less competitive. One
teacher replaced her school's 1-mile run with a 12-minute
run. That way, everyone finishes at the same time. Even
slow runners can enjoy themselves.

[46-48] 두 사람의 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Person A All forms of sport and entertainment that use
animals should be banned. Animals, like us, can feel fear,
stress, exhaustion, and pain. To use animals for our own
amusement, whether hunting them for sport or making them
perform for us, is cruel. Though humans are a species with
a great amount of power and control over other species, they
have a responsibility not to abuse that power. Using animals
in sports and entertainment is .
Person B We need to keep a balance between human
pleasure and animal welfare. If we regard the animal welfare
as the most important thing, we should ban all sports in
which animals are treated cruelly, or are at high risk of
injury or death. However, some sports are different. Anyone
who works in horse-racing or dog-racing will tell you this:
their interest is to make sure that animals are healthy and
happy to make them do well in racing. They will also tell
you that most of these animals enjoy racing and enjoy
winning.

(A)
When opening the door, he made an amazing change. He
had a wide smile on his face and he hugged his two small
children and gave his wife a kiss. Afterwards, he walked
me to the car. When we passed the tree, my curiosity led
me to ask him about what I had seen him do earlier.
(B)
I hired a carpenter to help me repair an old farmhouse.
He had just finished a hard first day on the job and now
his old pickup truck refused to start. While I drove him
home, he sat in stony silence. On arriving he invited me in
to meet his family. As we walked toward the front door,
he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips of the
branches with both hands.
(C)
“Oh, that's my trouble tree,” he replied. “I know I can't
help having troubles on the job, but one thing's for sure,
troubles don't belong in my house with my wife and
children. So I just hang them up on the tree every night
when I come home. Then in the morning I pick them up
again.” “Funny thing is,” he smiled, “when I come out in
the morning to pick them up, there aren't nearly as many
as I remember hanging up the night before.”
