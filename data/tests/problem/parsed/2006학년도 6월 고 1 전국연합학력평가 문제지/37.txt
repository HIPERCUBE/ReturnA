37. These days many Americans consider pennies as an
annoyance. In fact, many people don’t use them. According to
my class survey, about the two-third of the class finds pennies
bothersome. They take up space and add weight to your
pockets, wallets, and purses. They get in the way when you’re
trying to find other coins. They slow down checkout lines when
you have to search for exact change. And most of the time
when you really need coins, for copy machines, pay phones, or
vending machines, you can’t use pennies anyway.
