43. When we ask our friends for advice, we really want them
to agree with our actions. If they tell us we were wrong to
behave as we had done, we react with surprise and refuse to
accept what they say. If they respond agreeably, we not only
feel accepted but happy to have a wise friend. This hunger for
agreement is probably strongest when we feel the most doubt
about our own actions. So, when our friends ask us for advice
about their behaviors, we had better give positive responses to
them.
