We cannot see thunder, but we can hear ① it. It has the
sound of an explosion. It's like a shot from a gun. ② It has
different sounds. Sometimes ③ it sounds like clapping. Many
people are afraid of ④ it. But it cannot hurt people. Then how
does this phenomenon happen? It is the air pushed by the heat
of lightning, so it makes noises. In this way, thunder always
goes together with lightning . ⑤ It makes thunder. Light travels
faster than sound, so we see lightning before we hear it.

We are all very glad that the new train line has opened to
Euro-Disney just outside Paris. However, I must report that the
trains are very crowded and uncomfortable at the busiest time.
It's waste of money because the trip from Paris is so
unpleasant. In order to attract more visitors to the park, we
must ask the government to put more trains in service during
the peak hours. There are also many tourists who do not speak
French; therefore, we need train employees who speak English
and other languages at the train information desks. If we do
this, I'm sure more visitors will come to Euro-Disney in
comfort and safety.
① to suggest improvements
② to apologize to customers
③ to advertise an amusement park

25. Handel, unlike Bach, was already an accomplished composer
when he journeyed to Italy in 1706. There he composed operas
and oratorios. For his famous oratorio, Messiah, he used a
libretto from the Bible. The Messiah was a great success in
London. All the nobility was present, even the royalty. During
the ‘Hallelujah Chorus,’ the King was so excited that he rose to
his feet. So the whole audience rose. Ever since that time, it
has been the custom for audiences to during the

26. A music teacher wanted to explain to his students the
difference between music and noise. He brought a set of different
sized blocks of wood to the class. The students were surprised
to see him throw the blocks randomly at the wall. Everyone
agreed it was noise. He then took the same blocks and again
threw them at the wall. This time, however, he threw them in a

27. Sign language for the deaf was first systematized in
France during the 18th century by Ebbot Charles. It was
brought to the United States in 1816. Now it is the fourth most
used language in the United States today. In most respects,
sign language is just like any spoken languages, with a rich
vocabulary and a highly rule-governed grammar. The only
difference is that in sign language, information is processed
through the eyes rather than the ears. Thus,
play an important part in conveying information.

② sense of humor and proper attitude
③ foreign culture and international language
④ rich vocabulary and correct grammar

The summer had passed almost without a single raindrop and
once again it was time for the winter farming. Without water,
however, there would be no winter farming: no corns, no sweet
potatoes, no winter rice. By this time, the Hasari's one
remaining cow was nothing but skin and bone. It had been a
long time since he had had any straw to give her. She was fed
on the leaves of the three banana trees which provided a little
shade for his house. One morning Hasari found her lying on
her side with her tongue hanging out. It was then that he
realized that his other animals were going to die.

“You promised to buy me a suit. You said nothing about
wearing Uncle John's suit,” cried Hector. “We know, but we
can't manage it now. Since your Uncle John is the same size
as you, and he is nice enough to lend you his new suit, what's
the difference?” said his mom. Hector felt the blood rushing to
his face. His parents had been preparing his graduation party
for more than a week. ‘They should have spent the money on
my suit instead of on a dumb party,’ he thought.

Usually, the bigger something is, the stronger its gravity.
Gravity is the invisible force that pulls things toward the
ground. The farther out in space you go, the less gravity
there is. (① )When people leave the space shuttle, they have
to stay hooked on the lines. (② ) If they didn't, they would
just float away! (③ ) But things hold gravity to pull others
towards themselves. (④ ) For example, Jupiter is so big that
all of the other planets could fit inside of it. (⑤ ) It has
stronger gravity than all the other planets.

Italy is one of the countries with a lower birth rate in the
world. Its lower birth rate has several causes. One cause is
that in the 1970s an increase of ① unemployment left people
feeling financially insecure. They chose to have ② fewer
children. Another cause is that more people moved from rural
to urban areas. The cost of living and raising children in the
city was ③ lower, so people didn't have many children. The
third reason is that ④more women now have careers outside
of the home. The final reason is that many adults want a
lifestyle that they can enjoy themselves in ⑤ small families.
33. 다음 글에서 필자의 주장으로 가장 적절한 것은?
The article ‘Kids Gone Wild’ reminded me of all the conflicts
that kids are causing. After reading it, I realized how wild I
was when I was a kid. I believe that it's okay for kids to be
wild sometimes because they usually have no ideas what their
actions cause and they need to enjoy their childhood. Adults
don't have to treat kids as the way they are being treated,
because kids are just kids. Adults should treat them in the
same way they wanted to be treated when they were kids.
Adults shouldn't blame kids when they do wrong because
they're innocent and don't know what they're doing.

long. They thought this long, flat head looked like
corn, which was a sign of high class.
(B) They also tied a small ball with the baby's hair so
that it fell between eyes. As the baby looked at it, he
or she later became cross-eyed. This was also a sign
of high class.
(C) They believed all people came from the corn god,
which was considered as the most important god. So
when a child was born, they put the head of the

36. “Put on your hat and coat, or you'll catch a cold.” Or
“Take off the wet clothes before you catch a cold.” You must
have heard these expressions. However, being wet or cold does
not cause colds. It does make it more likely that you will catch
a cold, though. Your body demands heat. No matter how cold it
is outside, your body needs to have a temperature of 36.5℃. If
you become cold, your body must produce extra heat. While
doing this, your body can't make enough germ-fighting cells to
keep the cold germs from attacking you.

37. These days many Americans consider pennies as an
annoyance. In fact, many people don’t use them. According to
my class survey, about the two-third of the class finds pennies
bothersome. They take up space and add weight to your
pockets, wallets, and purses. They get in the way when you’re
trying to find other coins. They slow down checkout lines when
you have to search for exact change. And most of the time
when you really need coins, for copy machines, pay phones, or
vending machines, you can’t use pennies anyway.
① ways to collect coins
② uselessness of pennies
③ size and designs of pennies
④ kinds of coins in America
⑤ procedure of making coins

Here I am! I traveled yesterday for four hours in a train. It's
a funny feeling because I never rode in one before. College is
the biggest, strangest place, so I get lost whenever I leave my
room. I will write you a description later when I'm feeling less
mixed-up. My classes don't begin until Monday morning, and
this is Saturday night. But I wanted to write a letter first, just
to make friends with you. It seems strange to write letters to
someone you don't know. It seems strange for me to write
letters at all―I've never written more than three or four in my
life.

In the United States, people enjoy entertaining at home. They
often invite friends over for a meal or a party. When people
invite someone they say like this: “Would you like to come
over for dinner this Friday?” Sometimes, however, people use
expressions that sound like invitations but which are not real
invitations. ( A ) , someone may say, “Please come over for
a meal sometime.” or “Let's get together for lunch soon.” These
are really just polite ways of ending a conversation. They are
not real invitations because they don't mention a specific time
or date. They just show that the person is trying to be
friendly. ( B ) , next time you hear what sounds like an
invitation, listen carefully. Is it a real invitation or is the person
just being friendly?

41. The organizers of a pop music concert in Hong Kong
recently faced a problem. They were planning a big concert at
Hong Kong Stadium. They expected that about 17,500 people
might attend the concert. The residents living near the stadium
were very angry about all the noise that might come from the
concert. Finally, the organizers came up with a great idea. On
the night of the concert, they gave out 17,500 pairs of gloves
for the audience to wear. When the concertgoers clapped, they
didn't make so much noise, and the nearby residents were no
longer angry about the concert.

42. A long line of excited kids formed in the cafeteria at
Edmunds Elementary School. The students were eager to try
tasty new food―bright green pizza! It may sound like a science
experiment gone bad. It's actually a fresh menu item made with
locally grown vegetables. Edmunds and other public schools in
Burlington, Vermont, are part of a farm-to-school program. The
program brings locally grown fruits and vegetables to the
cafeteria. At least 400 school districts in 23 states serve
farm-fresh food for lunch. The program is good for local
farmers who sell their products to the schools. It's also good
for kids' health to eat more fresh food.

② Some New Ways to Produce More
③ Regular Meals: Secret for Keeping Health

43. When we ask our friends for advice, we really want them
to agree with our actions. If they tell us we were wrong to
behave as we had done, we react with surprise and refuse to
accept what they say. If they respond agreeably, we not only
feel accepted but happy to have a wise friend. This hunger for
agreement is probably strongest when we feel the most doubt
about our own actions. So, when our friends ask us for advice
about their behaviors, we had better give positive responses to
them.
① 충고는 구체적이고 적극적으로 하라.
② 실수하지 않도록 행동을 조심하라.

⑤ 적절한 시기와 장소를 고려하여 충고하라.

44. The young people who buy the clothes in the magazines
are all fashion victims. They dress in the latest styles and
continue to change their image to follow this year's model.
While doing this, they are really making a statement about
themselves that “Look at me, I have no confidence in my own
taste. I want to follow fashion so that other people will not look
down on me.” So, being fashionable and wearing the latest
trends may hide a sense of unease about oneself. Here the
clothes are literally covering up the person's sense of insecurity.
① 패션잡지가 유행을 주도한다.
② 의복은 개인의 사회적 지위를 나타낸다.

⑤ 젊은이들은 자신만의 독특한 개성을 연출하려는 경향이 있다.

According to the experts, kids aged 4 to 12 should
exercise for 60 minutes or more each day. But kids won't
exercise if they don't enjoy it. So physical education teachers
have found new ways to make exercise fun. For some kids,
this means more exciting sports, like rock climbing. For
others, it means making activities less competitive. One
teacher replaced her school's 1-mile run with a 12-minute
run. That way, everyone finishes at the same time. Even
slow runners can enjoy themselves.
Physical education teachers found that more (A) and
less competition (B) the pleasure of exercise for kids.

[46-48] 두 사람의 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Person A All forms of sport and entertainment that use
animals should be banned. Animals, like us, can feel fear,
stress, exhaustion, and pain. To use animals for our own
amusement, whether hunting them for sport or making them
perform for us, is cruel. Though humans are a species with
a great amount of power and control over other species, they
have a responsibility not to abuse that power. Using animals
in sports and entertainment is .
Person B We need to keep a balance between human
pleasure and animal welfare. If we regard the animal welfare
as the most important thing, we should ban all sports in
which animals are treated cruelly, or are at high risk of
injury or death. However, some sports are different. Anyone
who works in horse-racing or dog-racing will tell you this:
their interest is to make sure that animals are healthy and
happy to make them do well in racing. They will also tell
you that most of these animals enjoy racing and enjoy
winning.

When opening the door, he made an amazing change. He
had a wide smile on his face and he hugged his two small
children and gave his wife a kiss. Afterwards, he walked
me to the car. When we passed the tree, my curiosity led
me to ask him about what I had seen him do earlier.
(B)
I hired a carpenter to help me repair an old farmhouse.
He had just finished a hard first day on the job and now
his old pickup truck refused to start. While I drove him
home, he sat in stony silence. On arriving he invited me in
to meet his family. As we walked toward the front door,
he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips of the
branches with both hands.
(C)
“Oh, that's my trouble tree,” he replied. “I know I can't
help having troubles on the job, but one thing's for sure,
troubles don't belong in my house with my wife and
children. So I just hang them up on the tree every night
when I come home. Then in the morning I pick them up
again.” “Funny thing is,” he smiled, “when I come out in
the morning to pick them up, there aren't nearly as many
as I remember hanging up the night before.”
