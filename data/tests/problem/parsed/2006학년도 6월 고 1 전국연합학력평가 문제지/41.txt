41. The organizers of a pop music concert in Hong Kong
recently faced a problem. They were planning a big concert at
Hong Kong Stadium. They expected that about 17,500 people
might attend the concert. The residents living near the stadium
were very angry about all the noise that might come from the
concert. Finally, the organizers came up with a great idea. On
the night of the concert, they gave out 17,500 pairs of gloves
for the audience to wear. When the concertgoers clapped, they
didn't make so much noise, and the nearby residents were no
longer angry about the concert.
