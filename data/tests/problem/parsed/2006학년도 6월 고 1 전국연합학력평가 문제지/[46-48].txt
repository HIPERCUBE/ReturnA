[46-48] 두 사람의 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Person A All forms of sport and entertainment that use
animals should be banned. Animals, like us, can feel fear,
stress, exhaustion, and pain. To use animals for our own
amusement, whether hunting them for sport or making them
perform for us, is cruel. Though humans are a species with
a great amount of power and control over other species, they
have a responsibility not to abuse that power. Using animals
in sports and entertainment is .
Person B We need to keep a balance between human
pleasure and animal welfare. If we regard the animal welfare
as the most important thing, we should ban all sports in
which animals are treated cruelly, or are at high risk of
injury or death. However, some sports are different. Anyone
who works in horse-racing or dog-racing will tell you this:
their interest is to make sure that animals are healthy and
happy to make them do well in racing. They will also tell
you that most of these animals enjoy racing and enjoy
winning.
