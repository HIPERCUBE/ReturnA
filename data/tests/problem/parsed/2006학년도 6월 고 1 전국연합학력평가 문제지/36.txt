36. “Put on your hat and coat, or you'll catch a cold.” Or
“Take off the wet clothes before you catch a cold.” You must
have heard these expressions. However, being wet or cold does
not cause colds. It does make it more likely that you will catch
a cold, though. Your body demands heat. No matter how cold it
is outside, your body needs to have a temperature of 36.5℃. If
you become cold, your body must produce extra heat. While
doing this, your body can't make enough germ-fighting cells to
keep the cold germs from attacking you.
