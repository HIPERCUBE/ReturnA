25. Handel, unlike Bach, was already an accomplished composer
when he journeyed to Italy in 1706. There he composed operas
and oratorios. For his famous oratorio, Messiah, he used a
libretto from the Bible. The Messiah was a great success in
London. All the nobility was present, even the royalty. During
the ‘Hallelujah Chorus,’ the King was so excited that he rose to
his feet. So the whole audience rose. Ever since that time, it
has been the custom for audiences to during the
‘Hallelujah Chorus.’
