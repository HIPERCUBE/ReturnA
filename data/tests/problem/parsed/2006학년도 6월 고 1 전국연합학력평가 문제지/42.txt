42. A long line of excited kids formed in the cafeteria at
Edmunds Elementary School. The students were eager to try
tasty new food―bright green pizza! It may sound like a science
experiment gone bad. It's actually a fresh menu item made with
locally grown vegetables. Edmunds and other public schools in
Burlington, Vermont, are part of a farm-to-school program. The
program brings locally grown fruits and vegetables to the
cafeteria. At least 400 school districts in 23 states serve
farm-fresh food for lunch. The program is good for local
farmers who sell their products to the schools. It's also good
for kids' health to eat more fresh food.
