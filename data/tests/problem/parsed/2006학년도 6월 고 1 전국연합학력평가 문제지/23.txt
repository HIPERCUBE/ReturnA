We are all very glad that the new train line has opened to
Euro-Disney just outside Paris. However, I must report that the
trains are very crowded and uncomfortable at the busiest time.
It's waste of money because the trip from Paris is so
unpleasant. In order to attract more visitors to the park, we
must ask the government to put more trains in service during
the peak hours. There are also many tourists who do not speak
French; therefore, we need train employees who speak English
and other languages at the train information desks. If we do
this, I'm sure more visitors will come to Euro-Disney in
comfort and safety.
