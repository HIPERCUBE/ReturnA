Touch screens let the user interact with a computer by the
touch of a finger, rather than typing on a keyboard or moving
a mouse, providing many advantages. ① One of the significant
advantages of the touch screens is that it's very easy to use.
② The reason is that it's natural to point things with a
finger. ③ In addition, touch screens are usually easy for the
user to learn. ④ A finger touching the screen interrupts the
beams, making an electronic signal. ⑤ You don't need to have
other skills except pointing a finger to have your requests
processed.
