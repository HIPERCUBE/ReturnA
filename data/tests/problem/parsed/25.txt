When selling our ideas, we tend to “overpromise” in our 
enthusiasm for our creation. In our vision of how we hope it 
will be, we leave no room for failure. The result will probably 
be disappointing. Not disastrous, but a little worse than 
expected. No one will say anything, but they just won’t trust 
you quite as much next time. Basically, you’ve blown it. If 
instead you point out the possible weaknesses and how to 
resolve them, you are not only building a trusting relationship 
with your client but you’re able to solve any problems. And if it 
does turn out the way you hoped, it is a bonus.
