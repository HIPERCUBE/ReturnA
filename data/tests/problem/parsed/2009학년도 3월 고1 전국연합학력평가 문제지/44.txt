Then one day I had the opportunity to fly with friends
on a plane to a beautiful resort.
I was scared of air travel. Friends said air travel is safer
than highway travel, but it made no difference to me. ( ① )
I had read many news stories describing crash scenes and
imagined these scenes happening to me. ( ② ) I didn’t want
to miss such a great vacation. ( ③ ) So I spent two weeks
imagining a smooth flight on a beautiful sunny day and an
easy landing. ( ④ ) When the day arrived, I wanted to go
more than any of my friends. ( ⑤ ) To everyone’s surprise,
I got on the plane and flew, loving every minute of it.
