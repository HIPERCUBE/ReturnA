My friend Martin used to complain about the city of Los
Angeles, ①where he lived for three years studying in a
college. He wanted to go around here and there, but he
couldn’t do so ② because of the traffic and the high prices.
Martin thought life would be ③much better if he were able
to move to another city. Right after finishing his program
and ④ received his degree, Martin moved to Boulder. Before
long, however, he began to complain again about the cold
weather and the boring life. He regretted leaving the sunny
weather and the ⑤ exciting lifestyle of Los Angeles.
