(A) My friend Don considered himself a musician. He
played the tambourine in high school, but he wasn’t very
good. (a) He also thought of himself as a singer, but he
seemed to have no talent. Still, Don didn’t give up his
dream of becoming a singer­songwriter, and went to
Nashville, Tennessee.
(B) Years passed, and we almost lost touch with each
other. One day, I got a call from a friend who also knew
Don. “Listen to this,” (b) he said. Then he held the phone
up close to his radio speaker. I heard a good song playing.
“That’s Don,” my friend said. I couldn’t believe it. A song
Don had written and recorded! I thought (c) he had made it.
(C) In Nashville, he bought a used car and slept in it
because he didn’t have enough money. He got a job working
at night so that he could visit record companies during the
day. (d) He learned how to play the guitar. He kept writing
songs and practicing his guitar, knocking on every door of
opportunity.
(D) A few years after the phone call, I also heard that
the popular singer Kenny Rogers had recorded one of Don’s
songs. The title was The Gambler and it was one of the
most famous songs of the time. Don Schlitz has since
written numerous number one songs. (e) He became a
successful composer as a result of his endless efforts.
