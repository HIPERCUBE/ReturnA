24. What is the essence of law? I think the law takes away
the right of revenge from people and gives the right to the

① sharing meals ② going on a diet

the environment to control their body temperature. On the
other hand, dinosaurs controlled their own body temperature.
They did not depend on their surroundings. All of these

own personal standards, it can really make you frustrated.
This is what you can do if you have to live with a messy
roommate: . Otherwise, you can
send wrong messages to your roommate. One is that you
don’t mind doing all the cleaning yourself. Another is that if

32. One of my friends grew up with five brothers and sisters.
There were so many children that her family had little
money for movies and other “going­out” activities. Instead,
her parents filled the house with games of all kinds. All of
the children grew up to be active game­players. Probably

educational. My friend recalls learning how to spell over a
Scrabble board and learning about money over Monopoly.
She adds that it was fun to learn through playing those
games.

33. Even if you often lose your keys, forget where you
parked your car, or cannot find important papers, your
memory stores more information than all the libraries in the
world. You forget an event, and then twenty years later
something will bring back that memory ― a smell, a sound,
a person, or a picture ― and instantly your mind will recall
every detail about the event. Think of how many voices you
recognize on the telephone. Once, a friend whom I hadn’t
talked to in twenty years called me. All he said was “Hello,”
and before he said his name I knew who it was.

② etiquettes of telephone talk
③ the power of human memory
④ the meaning of true friendship
⑤ the process of storing information

so that you will have tools for success later in life. It’s also
important to concentrate on what you can do to make the
world a better place. It is useless to worry that you are not
beautiful enough.

sun or winter cold. They do not need special kinds of soil.
But the gardener who raises irises does have one job to do

crowded, they must be dug up and divided.

The Capilano Bridge is listed in the Guinness Book of
Records as the world’s longest suspension foot bridge. The
bridge is 137 meters long and rises 70 meters above the
Capilano River in Canada. Originally, the bridge was built of
wood and rope in 1889. It helped workers, who cut the
trees from the valley, cross the river. Today, however,
adventure­seeking tourists walk across this narrow, swinging
bridge. Now the bridge is made of steel safely fixed in 13
tons of concrete on either side of the valley.

38. When we were children, it took us a very long time to
get what we really wanted. Of course, we had to get a good
grade to get it. Today, however, kids are growing up in a
world full of goods. They are given all kinds of toy bears
even before they know what the bear is. Most kids do not
even have to wait anxiously for Christmas or their birthday
to have what they want. When I walk into my children’s
room, I wonder what to buy my four­year­old son for
Christmas.

39. Francis Bacon said “Knowledge is power.” But knowledge
alone is not power. Knowledge has value only in the hands
of someone who has the ability to think well. People must
learn how to think well to achieve their dreams. David J.

people’s thinking.” Knowledge should go hand in hand with
the ability to think well. [1점]

Tolkein and C. S. Lewis. Tolkein is known as the author of
The Lord of the Rings and Lewis as The Chronicles of
Narnia. However, only a few readers know about their
friendship and influence on each other. Thanks to the

Lewis died in 1963.

42. Real environmental change depends on us. We can’t wait
for world leaders to take action. We must make changes
ourselves and I believe we can. When we think of our
environment, we have to think of our own responsibilities.
We have to be more environment­friendly. We must not buy
so many things. We must not throw away so many things.
We should carry our own cups. We should eat natural food.
Above all, we should get out into nature. Gandhi said many
years ago that we must change ourselves first to change the
world. Let’s first change ourselves and then change the
world!
① Find New Energy for Future!
② The World Is Getting Smaller!
③ Have Respect for Your Elders!
④ Saving the Earth Starts from You!

On the newly swept beach is one seagull. The sound of

street from the beach to the old town. We turn a corner and
find a group of musicians in front of one of the old buildings
above the sea. They are playing, rather well, something
familiar by Beethoven. At one of the tables in a restaurant

Then one day I had the opportunity to fly with friends
on a plane to a beautiful resort.
I was scared of air travel. Friends said air travel is safer
than highway travel, but it made no difference to me. ( ① )
I had read many news stories describing crash scenes and
imagined these scenes happening to me. ( ② ) I didn’t want
to miss such a great vacation. ( ③ ) So I spent two weeks
imagining a smooth flight on a beautiful sunny day and an
easy landing. ( ④ ) When the day arrived, I wanted to go
more than any of my friends. ( ⑤ ) To everyone’s surprise,
I got on the plane and flew, loving every minute of it.

When we walk into a supermarket, we can find many
tropical fruits. But if we look at the labels, we see
mangoes from India and pineapples from the Philippines.
That usually means they have been flown from those
countries so that we can eat them fresh! A problem
rises here. Air flight increases global warming gases.
Similarly, we can eat our summer fruits like watermelons
and peaches in midwinter. This means a lot of fuel is
burned up to grow them. Again, it adds to the global
warming gases.
The more (A) of fruits we have, the more serious
(B) becomes.

(A) My friend Don considered himself a musician. He
played the tambourine in high school, but he wasn’t very
good. (a) He also thought of himself as a singer, but he
seemed to have no talent. Still, Don didn’t give up his
dream of becoming a singer­songwriter, and went to
Nashville, Tennessee.
(B) Years passed, and we almost lost touch with each
other. One day, I got a call from a friend who also knew
Don. “Listen to this,” (b) he said. Then he held the phone
up close to his radio speaker. I heard a good song playing.
“That’s Don,” my friend said. I couldn’t believe it. A song
Don had written and recorded! I thought (c) he had made it.
(C) In Nashville, he bought a used car and slept in it
because he didn’t have enough money. He got a job working
at night so that he could visit record companies during the
day. (d) He learned how to play the guitar. He kept writing
songs and practicing his guitar, knocking on every door of
opportunity.
(D) A few years after the phone call, I also heard that
the popular singer Kenny Rogers had recorded one of Don’s
songs. The title was The Gambler and it was one of the
most famous songs of the time. Don Schlitz has since
written numerous number one songs. (e) He became a

A month ago, my husband, Mark, had a heart attack and
fell down at the airport on the way back from our trip.
Fortunately, a man kept his heart beating for several
minutes until a medical team arrived. I was very grateful to
that man for saving my husband’s life. However, I didn’t
have time to say thanks to him.
Then one day, my friend, Susan, asked me to let her
daughter live with my family for a few months. Her
daughter was going to attend the college near my house. I
couldn’t say yes right away because I had to take care of
my husband. He still needed some peace and quiet. Though
I explained my situation, Susan repeated her request. I
couldn’t refuse it.
A few days later, Susan and her husband brought their
daughter to my house. While he was parking his car, I led
Susan and her daughter to the living room. I prepared milk
and some cookies, and we began to talk about her
daughter’s college plans. At that moment, her husband came
into the living room. When I turned to him, I found that he
was the very person who had saved my husband at the
airport. I pointed out Mark’s picture to him, and he
recognized Mark and me. At last, I could get a chance to
him.
