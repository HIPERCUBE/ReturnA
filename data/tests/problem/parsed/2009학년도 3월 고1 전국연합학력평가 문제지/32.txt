32. One of my friends grew up with five brothers and sisters.
There were so many children that her family had little
money for movies and other “going­out” activities. Instead,
her parents filled the house with games of all kinds. All of
the children grew up to be active game­players. Probably
playing the games was for fun, but the end results were
educational. My friend recalls learning how to spell over a
Scrabble board and learning about money over Monopoly.
She adds that it was fun to learn through playing those
games.
