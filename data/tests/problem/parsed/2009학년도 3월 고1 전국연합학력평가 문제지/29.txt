One Hand Reach is one of the traditional games played
by people in Alaska. While playing the game, the player
should balance only on one or two hands. The target should
be within the reach of the player’s ① hand. The player
begins by keeping his feet ② off the floor as shown in
Figure 1. Then, to measure the distance, he looks ③ down
at the target hanging from the ceiling as in Figure 2.
Finally, he ④ stretches one of his hands towards the target
as shown in Figure 3. If he ⑤ touches it while balancing on
the other hand, the player succeeds.
