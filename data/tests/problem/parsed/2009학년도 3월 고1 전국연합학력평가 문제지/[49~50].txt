A month ago, my husband, Mark, had a heart attack and
fell down at the airport on the way back from our trip.
Fortunately, a man kept his heart beating for several
minutes until a medical team arrived. I was very grateful to
that man for saving my husband’s life. However, I didn’t
have time to say thanks to him.
Then one day, my friend, Susan, asked me to let her
daughter live with my family for a few months. Her
daughter was going to attend the college near my house. I
couldn’t say yes right away because I had to take care of
my husband. He still needed some peace and quiet. Though
I explained my situation, Susan repeated her request. I
couldn’t refuse it.
A few days later, Susan and her husband brought their
daughter to my house. While he was parking his car, I led
Susan and her daughter to the living room. I prepared milk
and some cookies, and we began to talk about her
daughter’s college plans. At that moment, her husband came
into the living room. When I turned to him, I found that he
was the very person who had saved my husband at the
airport. I pointed out Mark’s picture to him, and he
recognized Mark and me. At last, I could get a chance to
him.
