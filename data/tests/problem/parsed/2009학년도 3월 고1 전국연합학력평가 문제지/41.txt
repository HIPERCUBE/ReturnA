41. If you have an interest in fantasy novels, you have
probably heard the names of two great authors, J. R. R.
Tolkein and C. S. Lewis. Tolkein is known as the author of
The Lord of the Rings and Lewis as The Chronicles of
Narnia. However, only a few readers know about their
friendship and influence on each other. Thanks to the
encouragement of Lewis, Tolkein could complete his great
work. Likewise, Tolkein and his works inspired Lewis to
create Narnia, his fantasy world. Their friendship lasted until
Lewis died in 1963.
