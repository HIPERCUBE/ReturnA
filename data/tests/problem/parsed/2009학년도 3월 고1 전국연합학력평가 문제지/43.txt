On the newly swept beach is one seagull. The sound of
sweet music greets us as we climb the white walled narrow
street from the beach to the old town. We turn a corner and
find a group of musicians in front of one of the old buildings
above the sea. They are playing, rather well, something
familiar by Beethoven. At one of the tables in a restaurant
is a smiling baby in a stroller. Its mother is feeding it from
a jar of baby food. The baby is interested in its food, but it
is also interested in everything else that is going on.
