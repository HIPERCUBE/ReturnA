42. Real environmental change depends on us. We can’t wait
for world leaders to take action. We must make changes
ourselves and I believe we can. When we think of our
environment, we have to think of our own responsibilities.
We have to be more environment­friendly. We must not buy
so many things. We must not throw away so many things.
We should carry our own cups. We should eat natural food.
Above all, we should get out into nature. Gandhi said many
years ago that we must change ourselves first to change the
world. Let’s first change ourselves and then change the
world!
