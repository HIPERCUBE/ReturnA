45. 다음 글의 내용을 한 문장으로 요약하고자 한다. 빈칸 (A)와
(B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
When we walk into a supermarket, we can find many
tropical fruits. But if we look at the labels, we see
mangoes from India and pineapples from the Philippines.
That usually means they have been flown from those
countries so that we can eat them fresh! A problem
rises here. Air flight increases global warming gases.
Similarly, we can eat our summer fruits like watermelons
and peaches in midwinter. This means a lot of fuel is
burned up to grow them. Again, it adds to the global
warming gases.
The more (A) of fruits we have, the more serious
(B) becomes.
(A) (B)
