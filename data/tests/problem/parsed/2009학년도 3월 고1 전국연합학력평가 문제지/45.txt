When we walk into a supermarket, we can find many
tropical fruits. But if we look at the labels, we see
mangoes from India and pineapples from the Philippines.
That usually means they have been flown from those
countries so that we can eat them fresh! A problem
rises here. Air flight increases global warming gases.
Similarly, we can eat our summer fruits like watermelons
and peaches in midwinter. This means a lot of fuel is
burned up to grow them. Again, it adds to the global
warming gases.
The more (A) of fruits we have, the more serious
(B) becomes.
(A) (B)
① choices ······· global warming
② choices ······· water pollution
③ choices ········ economic crisis
④ safety ········ global warming
⑤ safety ········ economic crisis

A month ago, my husband, Mark, had a heart attack and
fell down at the airport on the way back from our trip.
Fortunately, a man kept his heart beating for several
minutes until a medical team arrived. I was very grateful to
that man for saving my husband’s life. However, I didn’t
have time to say thanks to him.
Then one day, my friend, Susan, asked me to let her
daughter live with my family for a few months. Her
daughter was going to attend the college near my house. I
couldn’t say yes right away because I had to take care of
my husband. He still needed some peace and quiet. Though
I explained my situation, Susan repeated her request. I
couldn’t refuse it.
A few days later, Susan and her husband brought their
daughter to my house. While he was parking his car, I led
Susan and her daughter to the living room. I prepared milk
and some cookies, and we began to talk about her
daughter’s college plans. At that moment, her husband came
into the living room. When I turned to him, I found that he
was the very person who had saved my husband at the
airport. I pointed out Mark’s picture to him, and he
recognized Mark and me. At last, I could get a chance to
him.
