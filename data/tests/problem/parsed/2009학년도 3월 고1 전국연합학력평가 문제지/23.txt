There are children who don’t want to learn to read. Do
you know why? ① It’s partly because they think their
parents will stop reading bedtime stories to them if they
can read. ② Usually, children enjoy their parents’ attention
while listening to bedtime stories. ③ The eldest children
become independent at an early age. ④ Probably, they are
afraid that this special attention will disappear if they learn
to read. ⑤ So, they need to be told that their parents will
continue to read bedtime stories even when they learn to
read by themselves.
