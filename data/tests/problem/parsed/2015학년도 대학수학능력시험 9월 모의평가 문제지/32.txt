32. Empathy is a character trait that we value in ourselves 
and in our friends, colleagues, and the professionals who 
serve us. The know-how to be empathetic is central to 
practical wisdom: unless we can understand how others 
think and feel, it’s difficult to know the right thing to do. 
But empathy has its dark side: too much understanding and 
sensitivity, too much seeing things from the other’s 
perspective, can                                        . 
Edmund Pellegrino, a scholar of bioethics, explains it like 
this: “If a physician identifies too closely as co-sufferer 
with the patient, she loses the objectivity essential to the 
most precise assessment of what is wrong, of what can be 
done, and of what should be done to meet those needs. 
Excessive co-suffering also impedes and may even 
paralyze the physician into a state of inaction.”
