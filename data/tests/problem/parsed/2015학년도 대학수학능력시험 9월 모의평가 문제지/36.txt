36.
The study also revealed the commanders had given 
more attention and praise to the crew members for 
whom they had the higher expectations. 
Self-fulfilling prophecies can have a positive side. ( ① ) 
We know that students introduced to their teachers as 
“intellectual bloomers” often do better on achievement 
tests than do their counterparts who lack such a positive 
introduction. ( ② ) In a study of army tank crews, one 
set of tank commanders was told that some members of 
their assigned crews had exceptional abilities while others 
were only average. ( ③ ) In reality, the crew members 
had been assigned randomly so that the two test groups 
were equal in ability. ( ④ ) The commanders later 
reported that the so-called “exceptional” crew members 
performed better than the “average” ones. ( ⑤ ) The 
self-fulfilling effects in these cases strongly suggest that 
managers adopt positive and optimistic approaches toward 
others at work.
