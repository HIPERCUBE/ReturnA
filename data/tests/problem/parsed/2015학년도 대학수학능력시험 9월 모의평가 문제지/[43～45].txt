(A)
Jim Nelson, a junior at Manti High School, was an 
outstanding athlete. He had just made the school 
basketball team, one of the best in the state. But on 
October 23, 1996, most of (a) his athletic future was 
suddenly taken away from him. Jim was riding his 
bicycle at night to visit his friend. The road was very 
steep in some places. It was very dark and difficult to see.
(B)
Because of his injury, Jim wasn’t able to play on the 
basketball team during the rest of that year, but the 
coach did make him equipment manager so that he 
could come and practice. All summer long in 1997, each 
and every night, (b) he practiced making left-handed 
baskets. When the next season arrived, Jim was ready to 
try out for the team― and he made it again!
(C)
As he came around a sloping curve on his bicycle, Jim 
hit a car parked on the side of the road. (c) He ended 
up in the hospital. Besides bad cuts on his head, he 
broke his right arm and was in a cast for two months. 
Jim’s doctor gave him a series of tests. The doctor 
concluded that (d) he had suffered nerve damage and 
that he might never regain the full use of his right arm.
(D)
Jim never became a starter, but he was always the 
first substitute to go in the game. Jim got a chance to 
play in the last 30 seconds of the championship game 
when a starting player sprained (e) his ankle. With 10 
seconds left, Jim balanced the ball in his left hand and 
took the shot. The crowd was deathly quiet until―
swish! He made the three-point-shot left-handed! Jim 
won not only the game but also the hearts of his 
teammates for proving that with determination, no 
obstacle is too great.
