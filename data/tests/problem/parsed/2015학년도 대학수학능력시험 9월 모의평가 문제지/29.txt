A special feature of the real estate rental market is its 
tendency to undergo a severe and prolonged contraction 
phase, more so than with manufactured products. When the 
supply of a manufactured product ① exceeds the demand, 
the manufacturer cuts back on output, and the merchant 
reduces inventory to balance supply and demand. 
However, ② property owners cannot reduce the amount 
of space available for rent in their buildings. Space that 
was constructed to accommodate business and consumer 
needs at the peak of the cycle ③ remains, so vacancy 
rates climb and the downward trend becomes more severe. 
Rental rates generally do not drop below a certain point, 
the ④ maximum that must be charged in order to cover 
operating expenses. Some owners will take space off the 
market rather than lose money on it. A few, unable to 
subsidize the property, will sell at distress prices, and 
lenders will repossess others. These may then be placed 
on the market at lower rental rates, further ⑤ depressing 
the market.
* contraction phase: 경기 수축기(후퇴기)
** distress price: 투매 가격(판매자가 손해를 감수하는 매우 싼 가격)
