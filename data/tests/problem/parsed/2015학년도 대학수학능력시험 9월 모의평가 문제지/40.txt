Experts have found that reading classical texts benefits 
the mind by catching the reader’s attention and triggering 
moments of self-reflection. The brain activity of volunteers 
was monitored as they read classical works. These same 
texts were then “translated” into more straightforward, 
modern language and again the readers’ brains were 
monitored as they read the words. Scans showed that the 
more challenging prose and poetry set off far more 
electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian 
versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as 
it responded to each word and record how it lit up as the 
readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or 
difficult sentence structures. This lighting up lasts long 
enough to shift the brain into a higher gear, encouraging 
further reading. The research also found that reading the 
more challenging version of poetry, in particular, increases 
activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the 
readers to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences 
in light of what they have read. The academics said this 
meant the classics were more useful than self-help books.
