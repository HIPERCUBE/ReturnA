34. In the mid-1900s, John Kenneth Galbraith shocked the 
field of economics when he insisted that consumers do 
not merely participate in the marketplace, they are also 
the product of the systematic deployment of power 
throughout society. Within this deployment of power, 
commercial media ensures that consumers adopt values 
and beliefs that match the general requirements of the 
economy. The individual’s participation in mass behavior 
patterns is                                   .  
Consumers engage in shared patterns of consumption 
because they live within an economic system that 
operates as a belief system. It exercises considerable 
control over the meaning and value of things. When the 
economy functions as a belief system, it establishes 
severe limits on a consumer’s free choice. As consumers, 
our choices are not entirely our own. Our beliefs, values, 
thoughts, and emotions are highly conditioned to match 
the needs of the marketplace. [3점]
