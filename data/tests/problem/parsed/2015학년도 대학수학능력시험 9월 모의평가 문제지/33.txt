33. Bees have their choice of flora according to color. 
Lord Avenbury once made an experiment to see if the 
color of flowers attracted bees. Placing honey on slips of 
paper of different shades, he found that the insects which 
visited them seemed to have a marked preference for 
blue, after which came white, yellow, red, green and 
orange. This finding should be considered for our 
beekeeping planning. If pollination is the prime 
consideration of taming bees and if the crop is identified,  
while planning. 
Let us consider beekeeping near a mustard field. Mustard 
gives tiny yellow flowers full of nectar and pollen. For 
better yield of mustard seeds, pollination is necessary. 
But if there is plenty of blue-colored wild flora nearby, 
bees may prefer the blue flowers to mustard. Although 
we shall get honey and other products, the objective for 
pollination of mustard may be defeated. [3점]
