38. Some researchers investigated the effects of different 
media on children’s ability to produce imaginative responses. 
In one study, children in grades one through four were 
separated randomly into two groups and presented with 
the same fictional story. One group listened to the story 
via radio, while the other group watched the story on a 
television. ① Afterward, all of the children were asked 
what they thought would happen next in the story. ② The 
researchers rated children’s imaginativeness by recording 
the novel elements (such as characters, setting, dialogue, 
and feelings) they used in their responses. ③ Some 
novelists prefer to include as many characters as possible 
in their stories. ④ The children who listened to the radio 
produced more imaginative responses, whereas the children 
who watched the television produced more words that 
repeated the original story. ⑤ Media scholars have used 
this study to illustrate the “visualization hypothesis,” which 
states that children’s exposure to ready-made visual images 
restricts their ability to generate novel images of their own.
