Born in Budapest to a family of bankers, von Neumann 
was undeniably bright. At age eight, ① he had mastered 
calculus. At age twelve, he was reading works aimed at 
professional mathematicians. But ② he also loved to 
invent mechanical toys and became a child expert on 
Byzantine history. When it was time to go off to 
university, he agreed to study chemical engineering as a 
compromise with his father, who feared that ③ his son 
couldn’t make a living as a mathematician. Von Neumann 
kept his bargain by enrolling at the University of 
Budapest and promptly leaving for Berlin, where he spent 
his time doing mathematics, and returning to Budapest at 
the end of every semester to take examinations. He 
published ④ his second mathematics paper, in which he 
gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, at age 
nineteen. By age twenty-five ⑤ he had published ten 
major papers; by age thirty, nearly three dozen.
