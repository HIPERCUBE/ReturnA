But neither are aware of this fact when it comes to 
unmarked crosswalks. 
Studies do show that motorists are more likely to yield 
to pedestrians in marked crosswalks than at unmarked 
crosswalks. But as some researchers found, that does not 
necessarily make things safer. ( ① ) When they compared 
the way pedestrians crossed at both kinds of crosswalks 
on roads with considerable traffic volumes, they found that 
people at unmarked crosswalks tended to look both ways 
more often, waited more often for gaps in traffic, and 
crossed the road more quickly. ( ② ) Researchers suspect 
that both drivers and pedestrians are more aware that 
drivers should yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks. 
( ③ ) Not knowing traffic safety laws, it turns out, is 
actually a good thing for pedestrians. ( ④ ) Because they 
do not know whether cars are supposed to stop, they act 
more cautiously. ( ⑤ ) Marked crosswalks, by contrast, 
may give pedestrians an unrealistic picture of their own 
safety. [3점]
