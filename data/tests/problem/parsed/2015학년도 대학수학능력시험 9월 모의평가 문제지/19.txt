Everybody has moments of doubt about something or 
other from time to time; it is a natural process. The 
challenge is not to let those moments accumulate and 
affect your self-belief. You will always face the challenge 
of other people’s comments and opinion. There are 
people that you feel good being around and others you 
don’t. Some people give you positive energy because 
they believe in you. You feel it and you rise to the 
occasion. Others may always have a negative comment to 
make about what you are doing or talking about. Don’t 
let these comments rock your self-belief. Always question 
the person’s reason for the comment. If it is based on 
fact, you should listen; if not, then it is only their 
opinion. You will need to stay strong.
* rise to the occasion: 위기 상황에서 능력을 발휘하다
① 인맥이 넓은 사람들과 교제하라.
② 성공하기 위해 도전적인 자세를 가지라.
③ 일시적 감정으로 타인을 비판하지 말라. 
④ 좌절감을 느낄 때는 성공한 경험을 생각하라.
⑤ 선별적인 의견 수용으로 자기 확신이 흔들리지 않게 하라.
