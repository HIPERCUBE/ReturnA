18. 밑줄 친 These가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
These come in different shapes and sizes, but they are all
alike in some way. They are tall enough to catch the strong
winds that blow high above the ground. They have a wheel,
which is the part that spins. The wheel has paddles, sails,
or blades for the wind to push against. When the wind
blows, the wheel spins. This makes a push that runs a water
pump or an electricity generator. Water pumped by them can
be stored in tanks, and electricity made when they run can
be stored in batteries. You can use the stored-up water and
the reserved electricity in your home.
