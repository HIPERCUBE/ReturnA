The above figure shows how a spring scale measures the
weight of an object, using a rack and pinion gear system. The
rack is the series of evenly spaced teeth attached to the ①bottom
end of the spring; the pinion is the ② toothed wheel attached to
the dial needle. This system converts the small linear motion of
the stretching spring into a much more visible ③rotary motion of
the dial needle. When you place an object in the basket, the
basket starts ④descending and as it does, the spring stretches.
As the spring stretches, the rack moves downward, and its teeth
cause the pinion to rotate. The farther the rack moves, the more
the pinion turns, and the ⑤ lower the weight indicated by the
needle.
