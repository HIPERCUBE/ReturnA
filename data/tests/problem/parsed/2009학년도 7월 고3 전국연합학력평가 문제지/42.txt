42. Though most people study gi for health reasons, the Russians
may have used it for other purposes. They secretly made a
machine using gi energy. The machine looked like a fighter
pilot’s helmet, but with a lot of wires and computer
attachments on its outside. According to a Russian scientist
who worked on this project, test subjects would put the helmet
on their head, direct their eyes at their target, and concentrate.
After a few seconds the targets would begin to react strangely.
“We were able to achieve success (death) with small animals.
Larger animals and humans would just get hot and sweaty,”
said the scientist. This program was stopped in the mid 1960s,
when Russia decided to focus more on the space race with the
United States to reach the moon.
