32. When a person moves from a cool, rainy, and coastal
region to a hot, dry, and mountainous area, a number of
physiological changes must be undergone that allow survival
in the new environment. The human body changes in order
to regulate body temperature more efficiently. To keep from
overworking the heart, the body’s heart rate slows down.
Additionally, the body perspires less to prevent dehydration.
Furthermore, people who are unaccustomed to living in high
altitudes usually have trouble breathing because of the
decreased oxygen levels. So the human body causes an
increase in red blood cells, which makes it possible for
humans to breathe at higher altitudes.
