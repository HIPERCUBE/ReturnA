26. We volunteer at schools, shelters, and food banks. We give
millions each year to charitable organizations. On a more
intimate level we make chicken soup for sick friends or stop
to help strangers with car trouble. Yet many of us are
reluctant to request aid when we need it. Pride,
embarrassment, not wanting to be a burden, or fear of
rejection can keep us from seeking help, even when we very
well may be in need. Needing help is not a weakness. It
may be a challenge and a risk to ask for help, but that
gives us one more opportunity to grow and learn.
___________________ requires examining our own needs and
accepting areas where there is room for improvement in our
lives. We are called to put aside our egos and admit that we
are not totally self-sufficient.
