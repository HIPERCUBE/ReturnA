(A) During the war with Russia, Napoleon’s troops were
battling in the middle of a small town, when he was
accidentally separated from his men. A group of Russian
Cossacks began chasing him through the twisting streets.
He ran for his life and ducked into a little furrier’s shop. As
he entered the shop, gasping for breath, he saw the furrier
and cried piteously, “Save me! Where can I hide?” The
furrier said, “Quick, under this pile of furs in the corner,”
and he covered him up with many furs.
(B) Napoleon drew himself up to his full height and said to
the furrier indignantly, “How could you ask such a question
of me, the Emperor! Guards, take this impudent man out,
blindfold and execute (a) him. I myself will personally give
the command fire!” The guards dragged him outside, stood
him up against a wall, and blindfolded him. The poor man
could see nothing, but (b) he could hear the movements of
the guards as they slowly shuffled into a line and prepared
their rifles. He could feel the wind chilling his cheeks and
the uncontrollable trembling in his legs.
(C) Then he heard Napoleon clear his throat and call out
slowly, “Ready... aim...” In that moment, knowing that even
these sensations were about to be taken from (c) him
forever, he felt tears pouring down his cheeks. After a long
period of silence, he heard footsteps approaching him and
the blindfold was stripped from his eyes. Still partially
blinded by the sudden sunlight, (d) he saw a powerful glance
looking deeply and intently into his own eyes. Then
Napoleon said softly, “Now you know what it is like.”
(D) No sooner had he finished than the Russian Cossacks
burst in the door, shouting “Where is Napoleon? We saw
him come in.” They tore his shop apart trying to find him.
They poked into the pile of furs with their swords but
didn’t find him. Soon, they gave up and left. After some
time, (e) he crept out from under the furs, unharmed, just as
his guards came in the door. The furrier turned to him and
said timidly, “Excuse me for asking this question of such a
great man, but what was it like to be under those furs,
knowing that the next moment would surely be your last?”
