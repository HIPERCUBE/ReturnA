Imagine a woman working contentedly at an interesting job
for $40,000 a year. A new job opportunity arises that offers
her $60,000. She switches jobs, but, alas, after 6 months, the
new company goes under. The old company is so happy to
take her back, so happy, in fact, that it raises her salary to
$45,000. Is she happy with the raise? Will it even feel like a
raise? The answer is probably no. The $60,000 salary,
however briefly it was available, may establish a new
baseline for her, so that anything less is taken as a loss.
Though six months earlier, a raise from $40,000 to $45,000
would have felt wonderful, now it feels like a cut from
$60,000 to $45,000. What was once good enough, or even
better than that, isn’t good enough any more.
