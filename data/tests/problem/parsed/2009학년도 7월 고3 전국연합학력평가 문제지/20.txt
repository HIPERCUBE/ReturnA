As most of you know, we have been talking for several
months with the people at NJ & K about merging our two
companies. We are pleased that the details have been worked out
and we’ll be combining our businesses. We are looking forward
to a long and successful alliance with NJ & K, since our
products complement each other so well. This notification is to
let you know that we’ll be moving our offices and people to
Montreal. We know that this will be difficult and troublesome for
some of you, but we sincerely believe that it is in the best
interests of our new company. We hope that all of you will join
us in this exciting opportunity.
