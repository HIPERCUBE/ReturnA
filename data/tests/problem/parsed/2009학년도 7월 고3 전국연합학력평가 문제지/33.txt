33. To understand human behavior, it is essential to grasp the
ideas of inferiority. All people develop some sense of inferiority
because they are born completely helpless and remain that way
throughout childhood. It is a normal condition for all people
and a source of all human striving. Life becomes a process of
finding ways to become less inferior. Feelings of inferiority can
be the wellspring of success rather than being considered a
sign of weakness or abnormality. In many cases, the moment
we experience inferiority, we are pulled by the striving for
superiority. The goal of superiority pulls people forward toward
mastery and enables them to overcome obstacles, thus
contributing to the development of human community.
