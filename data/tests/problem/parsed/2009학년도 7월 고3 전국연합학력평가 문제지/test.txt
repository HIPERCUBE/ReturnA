These come in different shapes and sizes, but they are all
alike in some way. They are tall enough to catch the strong
winds that blow high above the ground. They have a wheel,
which is the part that spins. The wheel has paddles, sails,
or blades for the wind to push against. When the wind
blows, the wheel spins. This makes a push that runs a water
pump or an electricity generator. Water pumped by them can
be stored in tanks, and electricity made when they run can
be stored in batteries. You can use the stored-up water and
the reserved electricity in your home.

Would the company really not mail ④ it without the Japanese

Energize your life by starting each day with gratitude. When
you wake up, before you do anything else, stop and count your
blessings. Then find something special about each day ① that
you can be thankful. It’s a great way to get each day ② started
on a positive note, and it can make a major difference throughout
the day. ③Actively practicing gratitude on a regular basis will

will enable you to see opportunities and utilize resources which
may otherwise have remained ④ hidden. So in a very real

appreciate and enjoy. When you do this, those positive things
will grow ⑤ even stronger.

Since our attention is most likely to be drawn to the center
of the screen, movie directors generally place main elements
near or slightly above it. For the purpose of dramatic effects,
however, this standard is often violated. ①They put the
important elements in the top third of the screen to create a
sense of dominance. ② Characters displayed this way look
especially powerful or threatening because they look down on
us or on other characters or objects. ③ Likewise, the actors
and crew are required to follow the directors’ instructions
precisely. ④On the other hand, the opposite effect can be
achieved by locating characters in the lower portion of the
frame. ⑤The characters in this position look especially
vulnerable or helpless.

24. On December 26, 2004, a terrible tsunami occurred in some
Asian countries. More than 250,000 people were killed.
However, Tilly Smith, a ten-year-old British girl, saved over
100 lives using . She was on Maikhao beach
in Thailand, and she noticed that the water started to “go
funny” and the tide went out all of a sudden. Then she
remembered her teacher’s description of a tsunami. Tilly
realized that a tsunami wave was coming, and she shouted
for the people to get off the beach. She knew they had
approximately 10 minutes before the big wave hit land.
Fortunately, the people on the beach and in the nearby hotel
paid attention to her alert and ran to high ground. No one
was killed or hurt in that area because Tilly paid attention in
her geography class.
① lifeboats ② animal behavior
③ map reading ④ a weather forecast
⑤ classroom knowledge
25. A primary source of environmental problems is the fact
that pure air, clean rivers, and other environmental resources
are . Suppose you are raising sheep, and you
and your neighbors share a common piece of land for
grazing. To increase your income, you want to raise more
sheep and graze them on the land. If you do, you may
damage the land by overgrazing, but you will gain the entire
benefit of raising additional sheep and share only part of the
cost of the damage done to the common property. So you add
another sheep to your herd and then perhaps another.
Everyone else using the shared land makes the same
calculation, however, and in their own self-interest, they add
to their herds. Eventually, overgrazing is severe enough to
destroy the commons. In Aristotle’s words, “What is common
to the greatest number gets the least amount of care.”
① limited to humans ② hard to conquer
③ public, not private, goods ④ everlasting property
⑤ obstacles for industrial development
26. We volunteer at schools, shelters, and food banks. We give
millions each year to charitable organizations. On a more
intimate level we make chicken soup for sick friends or stop
to help strangers with car trouble. Yet many of us are
reluctant to request aid when we need it. Pride,
embarrassment, not wanting to be a burden, or fear of
rejection can keep us from seeking help, even when we very
well may be in need. Needing help is not a weakness. It
may be a challenge and a risk to ask for help, but that
gives us one more opportunity to grow and learn.
___________________ requires examining our own needs and
accepting areas where there is room for improvement in our
lives. We are called to put aside our egos and admit that we
are not totally self-sufficient.
① Reaching out to others
② Helping people in need
③ Speaking well of others
④ Finding what makes us work
⑤ Joining the volunteer organization
27. Recently some officials in India started a program designed
to using carnivorous turtles. According
to them, the turtles happily eat both animal and human
corpses. This is significant because among some religious
groups, disposing of bodies in rivers is a common practice.
In addition to their willingness to consume flesh, turtles also
loosen the earth along the river banks, making it easier for
plants to survive at the water’s edge. The plants, in turn,
help fight erosion at the bank, and some plants actually
contribute to the water’s purification. If the turtle experiment
succeeds in a few states, it will be implemented throughout
India. *carnivorous 육식성의
① diversify religious rituals
② clean up and revive rivers
③ preserve endangered animals
④ construct multipurpose dams
⑤ research food chain patterns
28. Some kinds of spiders weave thick white bands of silk
across the centers of their webs. The purpose of these extra
bands is to . The bands
make the webs many times more visible. Scientists
discovered the purpose of the extra bands while observing
the spiders in Florida. They noticed that songbirds would
change their flight directions suddenly just before flying into
clearly marked webs. The white bands seemed to serve as
markers to warn off birds that might tear the webs. The
birds themselves benefited from noticing the webs. Flying
into the webs left their feathers covered with sticky threads.
The same phenomenon was observed in the case of
butterflies and other large insects as well.
① warm the spiders’ bodies
② help the spiders move their prey easily
③ attract birds and insects into spiders’ webs
④ change their colors to escape from natural predators
⑤ prevent birds and large insects from damaging the webs

Reading has always been envied by those who rarely give
themselves that advantage. The man who is not in the habit of
reading is (A) restricted / restored in his immediate world.
His life falls into a set routine; he is limited to contact and
conversation with a few friends and (B)
acquaintances / acquisitions , and he sees only what happens
in his immediate neighborhood. But the moment he takes up a
good book, he is immediately put in touch with one of the
best talkers of the world. This talker leads him to a different
country or a different age. Now to be able to live two hours a
day in a different world and take one’s thoughts off the claims
of the immediate present is, of course, a (C)

The above figure shows how a spring scale measures the
weight of an object, using a rack and pinion gear system. The
rack is the series of evenly spaced teeth attached to the ①bottom
end of the spring; the pinion is the ② toothed wheel attached to
the dial needle. This system converts the small linear motion of
the stretching spring into a much more visible ③rotary motion of
the dial needle. When you place an object in the basket, the
basket starts ④descending and as it does, the spring stretches.
As the spring stretches, the rack moves downward, and its teeth
cause the pinion to rotate. The farther the rack moves, the more
the pinion turns, and the ⑤ lower the weight indicated by the
needle.

While interacting with others, people are also
simultaneously interacting with themselves, somewhat like
talking to themselves. In this internal interaction, they create
within themselves images of the other people and then
interact with these images rather than with the other people.
(A) , when people are interacting outwardly with
others, they are, in reality, interacting inwardly with their
own images of those people. This process contradicts the
popular belief that the world “out there”-such as the other
person-is, by itself, real. If the world out there is real without
being defined as real by us, we will all interact in the same
way with the other person, who, after all, is exactly the same
person. (B) , we do not all interact in the same way
because we are not really interacting with the same person
but instead with our own different images of that person.

32. When a person moves from a cool, rainy, and coastal
region to a hot, dry, and mountainous area, a number of
physiological changes must be undergone that allow survival
in the new environment. The human body changes in order
to regulate body temperature more efficiently. To keep from
overworking the heart, the body’s heart rate slows down.
Additionally, the body perspires less to prevent dehydration.
Furthermore, people who are unaccustomed to living in high
altitudes usually have trouble breathing because of the
decreased oxygen levels. So the human body causes an
increase in red blood cells, which makes it possible for
humans to breathe at higher altitudes.

33. To understand human behavior, it is essential to grasp the
ideas of inferiority. All people develop some sense of inferiority
because they are born completely helpless and remain that way
throughout childhood. It is a normal condition for all people
and a source of all human striving. Life becomes a process of
finding ways to become less inferior. Feelings of inferiority can
be the wellspring of success rather than being considered a
sign of weakness or abnormality. In many cases, the moment
we experience inferiority, we are pulled by the striving for
superiority. The goal of superiority pulls people forward toward
mastery and enables them to overcome obstacles, thus
contributing to the development of human community.
① positive aspects of inferiority
② external motivation for success
③ unpredictability of human behavior
④ the pleasure of achieving our goals
⑤ differences between inferiority and superiority

According to the Korea Tourism Organization, Japanese
visitors accounted for almost half of inbound tourists in 2007
with 2.3 million. Chinese travelers came in second with
420,467. The majority of foreign tourists visiting Seoul come
from non-English speaking countries, but English is still the
dominant language in cyberspace offering information about
Korea. Due to the lack of promotional web sites in foreign
languages other than English, travelers whose mother tongue
is not English have limited access to information about
Korean tourism. It’s time for the government to increase the
budget for foreign language services online. More manpower
needs to be allocated to provide diverse language services for
greater efficiency.

41. Microorganisms live in large numbers in groundwater at
great depths(as much as several thousand meters), where
they constitute a huge biomass. These microbes draw their
energy from reactions involving chemicals and minerals in
rocks. These reactions, aside from serving as a source of
energy for the microbes, continue the weathering process
underground. The chemicals released by the microbes during
these reactions can cause deterioration of water quality.
Groundwater contamination by microbes can be found near
leaky residential septic tanks as well. These containers,
widely used in neighborhoods that lack full sewer networks,
are settling tanks buried at shallow depths in which bacteria
decompose the solid wastes from household sewage.

42. Though most people study gi for health reasons, the Russians
may have used it for other purposes. They secretly made a
machine using gi energy. The machine looked like a fighter
pilot’s helmet, but with a lot of wires and computer
attachments on its outside. According to a Russian scientist
who worked on this project, test subjects would put the helmet
on their head, direct their eyes at their target, and concentrate.
After a few seconds the targets would begin to react strangely.
“We were able to achieve success (death) with small animals.
Larger animals and humans would just get hot and sweaty,”
said the scientist. This program was stopped in the mid 1960s,
when Russia decided to focus more on the space race with the
United States to reach the moon.

The sun was already setting as they reached the bank.
Suddenly the damp earth beneath Shaun’s sneakers gave way.
With a cry he slid down the steep bank. He grabbed wildly
at protruding branches to stop himself, but they all broke in
his hands. The shock of freezing water took Shaun’s breath
away. Before he could react, the strong current swept him
out to the center of the creek. On the bank, Roger raced back
and forth, barking frantically. As his master was carried
down the stream, Roger paralleled his progress on the shore,
watching Shaun. Without hesitation, the dog launched himself
off the bank. Roger tried repeatedly to grasp Shaun’s shirt in
his teeth, but his clumsy efforts just pushed the boy farther

In real life, however, our scripts are far more general and
ambiguous.
When we interact, we behave like actors by following
scripts that we have learned from others. These scripts
essentially tell us how to behave in accordance with our
statuses and roles. But this stage analogy has limitations.
( ① ) On stage, the actors have a detailed script that allows
them to rehearse exactly what they will say and do. ( ② )
They cannot tell us precisely how we are going to act or
how the other person is going to act. ( ③ ) In fact, as we
gain new experiences every day, we constantly revise our
scripts. ( ④ ) It is therefore much more difficult to be well
rehearsed. ( ⑤ ) This means that we have to improvise a
great deal, saying and doing many things that have not
crossed our minds before that very moment.

Imagine a woman working contentedly at an interesting job
for $40,000 a year. A new job opportunity arises that offers
her $60,000. She switches jobs, but, alas, after 6 months, the
new company goes under. The old company is so happy to
take her back, so happy, in fact, that it raises her salary to
$45,000. Is she happy with the raise? Will it even feel like a
raise? The answer is probably no. The $60,000 salary,
however briefly it was available, may establish a new
baseline for her, so that anything less is taken as a loss.
Though six months earlier, a raise from $40,000 to $45,000
would have felt wonderful, now it feels like a cut from
$60,000 to $45,000. What was once good enough, or even
better than that, isn’t good enough any more.

(A) During the war with Russia, Napoleon’s troops were
battling in the middle of a small town, when he was
accidentally separated from his men. A group of Russian
Cossacks began chasing him through the twisting streets.
He ran for his life and ducked into a little furrier’s shop. As
he entered the shop, gasping for breath, he saw the furrier
and cried piteously, “Save me! Where can I hide?” The
furrier said, “Quick, under this pile of furs in the corner,”
and he covered him up with many furs.
(B) Napoleon drew himself up to his full height and said to
the furrier indignantly, “How could you ask such a question
of me, the Emperor! Guards, take this impudent man out,
blindfold and execute (a) him. I myself will personally give
the command fire!” The guards dragged him outside, stood
him up against a wall, and blindfolded him. The poor man
could see nothing, but (b) he could hear the movements of
the guards as they slowly shuffled into a line and prepared
their rifles. He could feel the wind chilling his cheeks and
the uncontrollable trembling in his legs.
(C) Then he heard Napoleon clear his throat and call out
slowly, “Ready... aim...” In that moment, knowing that even
these sensations were about to be taken from (c) him
forever, he felt tears pouring down his cheeks. After a long
period of silence, he heard footsteps approaching him and
the blindfold was stripped from his eyes. Still partially
blinded by the sudden sunlight, (d) he saw a powerful glance
looking deeply and intently into his own eyes. Then
Napoleon said softly, “Now you know what it is like.”
(D) No sooner had he finished than the Russian Cossacks
burst in the door, shouting “Where is Napoleon? We saw
him come in.” They tore his shop apart trying to find him.
They poked into the pile of furs with their swords but
didn’t find him. Soon, they gave up and left. After some
time, (e) he crept out from under the furs, unharmed, just as
his guards came in the door. The furrier turned to him and
said timidly, “Excuse me for asking this question of such a
great man, but what was it like to be under those furs,
knowing that the next moment would surely be your last?”

We were on our way to visit an institution in 1954 with our
three daughters: Mary, twelve, Joan, nine, and Ruth, eighteen
months old. Because of little Ruth, handicapped since birth, we
were making this sad and silent trip. We had been advised to
place her in a special home. “It will be less of a burden,” “
Ruth will be better off with children like herself,” “Your other
children will have a home free of the care of a disabled
person.”
To break the silence, I flipped on the car radio and heard
the voice of a former classmate. I remembered him as a boy
without legs. He was now the president of an organization
employing persons who are disabled. He told of his childhood
and of a conversation with his mother. “When it was time for
another handicapped child to be born,” his mother explained,
“a god and his counselors held a meeting to decide where he
should be sent... where there would be a family to love him.
Well, our family was chosen.”
At this, my wife Edna leaned over and turned off the radio,
her eyes shining with unshed tears. “Let’s go home,” she said.
I touched Ruth’s tiny face. She looked like a beautiful symbol
of innocence. I knew at that moment Ruth was given to us for
a purpose. How miraculous it was that the voice of a friend,
with whom I’d had no contact for twenty years, should that
day speak to me ! Mere coincidence? Or was it a message
from heaven helping us hold on to a little girl who would
enrich our lives immeasurably in the years that followed?
