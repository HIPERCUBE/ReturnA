24. On December 26, 2004, a terrible tsunami occurred in some
Asian countries. More than 250,000 people were killed.
However, Tilly Smith, a ten-year-old British girl, saved over
100 lives using . She was on Maikhao beach
in Thailand, and she noticed that the water started to “go
funny” and the tide went out all of a sudden. Then she
remembered her teacher’s description of a tsunami. Tilly
realized that a tsunami wave was coming, and she shouted
for the people to get off the beach. She knew they had
approximately 10 minutes before the big wave hit land.
Fortunately, the people on the beach and in the nearby hotel
paid attention to her alert and ran to high ground. No one
was killed or hurt in that area because Tilly paid attention in
her geography class.
