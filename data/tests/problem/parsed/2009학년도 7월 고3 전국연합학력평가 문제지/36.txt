Marathon dancing is a dance activity that became popular in
the Great Depression. During this period, many unemployed
people competed in the contests in order to achieve fame or win
monetary prizes. This craze began when Alma Cummings danced
non-stop for 27 hours, wearing out six different partners, gaining
brief national fame for her feat. Realizing that good money could
be made from commercializing the contest, entertainment
promoters systematically held this kind of contest all over the
country. They charged admission to spectators and awarded a
winner with a cash prize. People could enter solo or with a
specific partner. Some competitions lasted from three to four
days and dancers were not even permitted to lie down to sleep.
