25. A primary source of environmental problems is the fact
that pure air, clean rivers, and other environmental resources
are . Suppose you are raising sheep, and you
and your neighbors share a common piece of land for
grazing. To increase your income, you want to raise more
sheep and graze them on the land. If you do, you may
damage the land by overgrazing, but you will gain the entire
benefit of raising additional sheep and share only part of the
cost of the damage done to the common property. So you add
another sheep to your herd and then perhaps another.
Everyone else using the shared land makes the same
calculation, however, and in their own self-interest, they add
to their herds. Eventually, overgrazing is severe enough to
destroy the commons. In Aristotle’s words, “What is common
to the greatest number gets the least amount of care.”
