41. Microorganisms live in large numbers in groundwater at
great depths(as much as several thousand meters), where
they constitute a huge biomass. These microbes draw their
energy from reactions involving chemicals and minerals in
rocks. These reactions, aside from serving as a source of
energy for the microbes, continue the weathering process
underground. The chemicals released by the microbes during
these reactions can cause deterioration of water quality.
Groundwater contamination by microbes can be found near
leaky residential septic tanks as well. These containers,
widely used in neighborhoods that lack full sewer networks,
are settling tanks buried at shallow depths in which bacteria
decompose the solid wastes from household sewage.
