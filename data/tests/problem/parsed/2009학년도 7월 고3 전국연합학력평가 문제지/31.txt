While interacting with others, people are also
simultaneously interacting with themselves, somewhat like
talking to themselves. In this internal interaction, they create
within themselves images of the other people and then
interact with these images rather than with the other people.

others, they are, in reality, interacting inwardly with their
own images of those people. This process contradicts the
popular belief that the world “out there”-such as the other

being defined as real by us, we will all interact in the same
way with the other person, who, after all, is exactly the same
person. (B) , we do not all interact in the same way
because we are not really interacting with the same person
but instead with our own different images of that person.
