27. Recently some officials in India started a program designed
to using carnivorous turtles. According
to them, the turtles happily eat both animal and human
corpses. This is significant because among some religious
groups, disposing of bodies in rivers is a common practice.
In addition to their willingness to consume flesh, turtles also
loosen the earth along the river banks, making it easier for
plants to survive at the water’s edge. The plants, in turn,
help fight erosion at the bank, and some plants actually
contribute to the water’s purification. If the turtle experiment
succeeds in a few states, it will be implemented throughout
India. *carnivorous 육식성의
