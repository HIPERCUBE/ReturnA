Since our attention is most likely to be drawn to the center
of the screen, movie directors generally place main elements
near or slightly above it. For the purpose of dramatic effects,
however, this standard is often violated. ①They put the
important elements in the top third of the screen to create a
sense of dominance. ② Characters displayed this way look
especially powerful or threatening because they look down on
us or on other characters or objects. ③ Likewise, the actors
and crew are required to follow the directors’ instructions
precisely. ④On the other hand, the opposite effect can be
achieved by locating characters in the lower portion of the
frame. ⑤The characters in this position look especially
vulnerable or helpless.
