39. According to a study released in France, the habitats of
wild bird species are shifting in response to global warming,
but not fast enough to keep pace with rising temperatures.
The study showed that the geographic range of 105 birds
species in France ― accounting for 99.5 percent of the
country’s wild avian population ―moved north, on average,
91 kilometers from 1989 through 2006. Average temperatures,
however, shifted northward 273 kilometers over the same
period, nearly three times farther. The fact that some birds
have responded to climate change had already been noted in
individual species. What surprised researchers was that the
shift held true for virtually all birds, and that the gap with
the rising temperatures was big and getting bigger. These
mismatches are likely to become greater over time, and could
eventually threaten some birds with extinction.
① Birds cannot keep up with climate change.
② It is difficult to identify bird migration routes.
③ The number of birds migrating north is increasing.
④ Actions for preventing avian influenza are required.
⑤ Global warming has been increasing the number of birds.
