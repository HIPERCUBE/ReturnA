In real life, however, our scripts are far more general and
ambiguous.
When we interact, we behave like actors by following
scripts that we have learned from others. These scripts
essentially tell us how to behave in accordance with our
statuses and roles. But this stage analogy has limitations.
( ① ) On stage, the actors have a detailed script that allows
them to rehearse exactly what they will say and do. ( ② )
They cannot tell us precisely how we are going to act or
how the other person is going to act. ( ③ ) In fact, as we
gain new experiences every day, we constantly revise our
scripts. ( ④ ) It is therefore much more difficult to be well
rehearsed. ( ⑤ ) This means that we have to improvise a
great deal, saying and doing many things that have not
crossed our minds before that very moment.
