We were on our way to visit an institution in 1954 with our
three daughters: Mary, twelve, Joan, nine, and Ruth, eighteen
months old. Because of little Ruth, handicapped since birth, we
were making this sad and silent trip. We had been advised to
place her in a special home. “It will be less of a burden,” “
Ruth will be better off with children like herself,” “Your other
children will have a home free of the care of a disabled
person.”
To break the silence, I flipped on the car radio and heard
the voice of a former classmate. I remembered him as a boy
without legs. He was now the president of an organization
employing persons who are disabled. He told of his childhood
and of a conversation with his mother. “When it was time for
another handicapped child to be born,” his mother explained,
“a god and his counselors held a meeting to decide where he
should be sent... where there would be a family to love him.
Well, our family was chosen.”
At this, my wife Edna leaned over and turned off the radio,
her eyes shining with unshed tears. “Let’s go home,” she said.
I touched Ruth’s tiny face. She looked like a beautiful symbol
of innocence. I knew at that moment Ruth was given to us for
a purpose. How miraculous it was that the voice of a friend,
with whom I’d had no contact for twenty years, should that
day speak to me ! Mere coincidence? Or was it a message
from heaven helping us hold on to a little girl who would
enrich our lives immeasurably in the years that followed?
