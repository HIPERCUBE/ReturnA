32. Dozens of studies have demonstrated the nature
of self-supervision. For instance, people who were asked to
make tricky choices and trade-offs ― such as setting up a
wedding registry or ordering a new computer ―were worse at
focusing and solving problems than others who had not made
the tough choices. In one study, some people were asked to
restrain their emotions while watching a sad movie about sick
animals. Afterward, they exhibited less physical endurance
than others who had let the tears flow freely. The research
shows that we burn up self-control in a wide variety of
situations: managing the impression we are making on others;
coping with fears; controlling our spending; trying to focus on
simple instructions such as “Don’t think of a white bear”; and
many, many others. [3점]
