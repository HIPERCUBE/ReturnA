One of the most famous highway illusions, “motion
parallax,” puzzled psychologists long before the car was
invented. This phenomenon can be easily glimpsed when you
look out the side window of a moving car.
(A) Obviously, we cannot make them move, no matter how fast
we may drive. What is happening is that as we fixate on an
object in that landscape, our eyes, to maintain their
fixation, must move in a direction opposite to the way we
are going.
(B) The foreground moves past very quickly, while trees and
other objects farther out seem to move by more slowly,
and things far in the distance, like mountains, seem to
move in the same direction as us.
(C) Wherever we fixate in that view, the things we see before
the point of fixation are moving quickly across our retina
opposite to the direction we are moving in, while things
past the point are moving slowly across our retina in the
same direction as we are traveling.
