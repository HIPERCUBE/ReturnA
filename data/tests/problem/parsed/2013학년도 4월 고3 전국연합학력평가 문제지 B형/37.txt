Most people who work are used to setting and pursuing
performance goals. Most workers will give you a blank stare if
you ask what their learning goals are, or they will offer up a
performance goal in disguise. (A) , “I would like to
learn to make more money,” and “I would like to learn to break
eighty in golf,” are simply performance goals with the word
learning inserted. How does a learning goal differ from a
performance goal? Performance is something you do that
brings about an observable change in the external world.
Learning, (B) , is a change that takes place within
the learner, although often as a result of interaction with the
external world. Thus a change in understanding based on new
information or on a new interpretation of old information would
be classified as learning.
