(A)
The sun was shining and most people were lightly dressed.
Everyone, except one girl who was standing apart in front of
the entrance of North Valley High School. She wore a
headscarf and she somehow looked like she didn’t belong
here. Our English teacher, Mrs. Brandon, arrived with the
girl wearing the headscarf coming up behind (a) her. The girl
seemed to be afraid and shy and I somehow felt sorry for
her.
(B)
The next day at school we sat next to each other and I
noticed that everyone was staring at (b) her as if she were a
monster. Then I saw Chloe, the captain of the cheerleading
team, coming right up to us saying that it was silly that she
was still wearing a headscarf in such a modern world. Lara
went red and started to stutter. I got angry at Chloe and told
her that she should tolerate other cultures. She turned red
and walked away, and Lara gave me a strong hug. Now Lara
and I are inseparable. (c) She teaches me some things about
her culture and I explain to her how to make popcorn.
(C)
When I was having a short break after the class, Mrs.
Brandon walked towards me and asked whether I could help
Lara with her English homework after school. Two
afternoons later I stood in front of a big house in the middle
of Beverly Hills with her address, which Mrs. Brandon gave
to me. Lara opened the door with a warm welcome, and I
immediately felt comfortable. I realized that (d) she was not
that afraid and shy. The more she told me about her life, the
more I understood her and her views. I lost track of time
talking with her until late night.
(D)
Mrs. Brandon said that her name was Lara and that she
came from the Middle East. Lara was supposed to introduce
herself but as soon as (e) she opened her mouth everyone
started to laugh. She had an accent sounding as if she had
just learned how to speak. Lara blushed and Mrs. Brandon
needed to calm the laughing class. Next to me, the seat was
not taken, the only one, always at the wrong time. She sat
next to me not saying anything and looking down at the floor.
