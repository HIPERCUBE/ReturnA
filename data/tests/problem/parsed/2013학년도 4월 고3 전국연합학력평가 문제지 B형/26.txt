Sonya asked for my advice about her five-year-old child’s
separation anxiety. “Anna wants to be with me at all times,” she
said. In Anna’s case, there was an early attempt to leave ① her
at a nice, small preschool for half days. She seemed to enjoy
the school, but was having a hard time departing from her
mother in the morning. “She was fearful and clingy and, over
time, ② she started to be more whiny at home and less happy,”
her mother said. I suggested that ③ she stop taking her to
preschool. The result was immediate and dramatic: “I got my
child back,” Sonya said. “She is happy again and self-engaged,
but ④ she is still unable to be away from me.” Anna will regain
her trust and confidence. She needs time in which there is no
reminder of ⑤ her experience of separation from her mother.
