30. Sybilla Masters에 관한다음글의내용과 일치하지않는것은?
Sybilla Masters was the wife of a prominent Philadelphia
merchant. She was also America’s first female inventor. In
1712, she invented a new way to grind corn into meal. Figuring
that this was going to be the next big thing, she was
determined to protect her idea. The State of Pennsylvania
didn’t offer patents at the time, so she set sail for England. It
took Sybilla several years to get what she came for. In the
meantime, she opened a hat store to support herself in London.
What Londoners thought of this energetic female inventor is
largely unrecorded. But in November of 1715, the British
government issued a patent to Thomas Masters for ‘a new
invention found out by Sybilla, his wife.’ Even though it was her
idea, and her years of effort that got the patent, the law
required that it be issued in her husband’s name.
