23. 다음글에서필자가주장하는바로가장적절한것은?
So many problems can be avoided by slowing down and
carefully considering how to proceed in any given situation. In
some instances, of course, there isn’t time to slow down and
we have to just react. But generally we have more time than
we allot ourselves to make decisions and draw conclusions.
Slowing down provides time to consider how an issue has been
framed and whether we have really considered all the relevant
factors. We ought to pause for a moment in order to reconsider
actions that could have serious consequences. Putting on the
mental brakes can stop you, for example, from reacting in anger
to someone on the road ―a situation that can lead to danger. If
more of us would take just a couple extra moments to think an
action through, we would all be much better off.
① 타인의충고에귀를기울여라.
② 한번에한가지일에만집중하라.
③ 현재의주어진상황에서최선을다하라.
④ 역경에굴복하지말고도약의기회로삼아라.
⑤ 행동하기전에여유를갖고생각할시간을가져라.
24. 다음글의 요지로가장 적절한것은?
I have always believed your home tells your story. That
tortoise shell on the wall? There was one exactly like it in my
mother’s house and I can’t see it without thinking about a
thousand family dinners. Those cuff links? They belonged to
somebody I loved; we picked them out on one of the most
perfect days we ever spent together. Each object tells a story
and each story connects us to one another and to the world.
The truth is, things matter. They have to. They are what we
live with and touch each and every day. They represent what
we have seen, who we have loved, and where we hope to go
next. They remind us of the good times and the rough patches,
and everything in between that has made us who we are.
① Things we live with are reflections of ourselves.
② Valuable things come when we don’t expect them.
③ Who we are is more important than what we have.
④ Various collections improve the quality of our lives.
⑤ Old memories matter in keeping social relationships.
25. 다음글의 제목으로가장 적절한것은?
According to the experts who are happiest in their careers,
most people encounter turning points at which they have a clear
choice. This choice is not, as you might think, “Should I stay or
should I go?” It is often a decision about doing something new
on the job: a training opportunity, an offer to take on new
responsibilities, a chance to move into a new area with which
one is unfamiliar. There are a host of possibilities, but the experts
concur on this one point: say yes. As far as work is concerned,
those experts can point to a decision where they were tempted
to say no, where staying the course was more comfortable and
less risky, but they finally decided to give it a go.
① Don’t Be Afraid to Say No
② Don’t Give Up, Hang in There!
③ Be Open to New Opportunities
④ Comfort: An Ultimate Goal in Life
⑤ Why Is Career Training Important?
26. 밑줄친 she[her]가 가리키는대상이나머지넷과다른것은?
Sonya asked for my advice about her five-year-old child’s
separation anxiety. “Anna wants to be with me at all times,” she
said. In Anna’s case, there was an early attempt to leave ① her
at a nice, small preschool for half days. She seemed to enjoy
the school, but was having a hard time departing from her
mother in the morning. “She was fearful and clingy and, over
time, ② she started to be more whiny at home and less happy,”
her mother said. I suggested that ③ she stop taking her to
preschool. The result was immediate and dramatic: “I got my
child back,” Sonya said. “She is happy again and self-engaged,
but ④ she is still unable to be away from me.” Anna will regain
her trust and confidence. She needs time in which there is no
reminder of ⑤ her experience of separation from her mother.
* whiny: 투덜대는
27. 다음글의 밑줄친부분 중, 어법상 틀린것은? [3점]
While digital production on tape has grown quickly and
steadily, there are some notable holdouts in areas of production
① in which film is still largely preferred for image capture. Put
simply, the picture on film still always looks better and more
nuanced visually. Once ② captured on celluloid with the film
look, such footage must then be transferred to a digital tape
format for editing. High-end commercials for many products
promoted across the nation, for example, still ③ are often shot
on film. Here the preference for the film look in glossy national
advertising campaigns ④prevailing. Nonetheless, television
producers have widely accepted that it is the use of camera
lenses ⑤ that more fully determines the “look” of any picture
than whether it is recorded digitally or on celluloid.
28. 다음 글의밑줄친 부분 중, 문맥상낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은
것은?
Pay is most carefully considered when a person is
applying for a job and considering an offer. In general,
people ① accept offers where the monetary compensation is
near the amount that they were hoping for. Over time,
employees often expect to receive raises and/or bonuses,
but these factors are not just about ②money. Employees
want to be compensated fairly for their work. If they are
taking on a heavier workload with more difficult projects, it
is likely they would expect ③ inadequate compensation for
their efforts. Part of this compensation could be monetary,
but often times ④ recognition is just as important. People
love to hear they have done a good job. A ⑤promotion that
includes a title change can be just as meaningful, if not
more meaningful than an increase in salary.
29. 도표의내용과일치하지 않는것은?
The graph above shows the top five categories of U.S.
consumer electronics sales and their share of total revenue in
2010 and 2011. ① PCs accounted for approximately 20 percent
of total revenue, topping the share of total revenue both in
2010 and 2011. ② Video game hardware, however, represented
the lowest percentage of revenue among the top five categories
in 2011, though it had the third highest in the previous year. ③
One noticeable category, which saw the biggest increase in
share of revenue, was tablets/e-readers, with its share more
than doubling between 2010 and 2011. ④Along with
tablets/e-readers, mobile phones also gained an increased
share in 2011, whereas the other three categories showed a
decreased share. ⑤TVs ranked the second highest in share of
revenue in 2010, and did the same in 2011 with only a small
decrease of 1.2%.
30. Sybilla Masters에 관한다음글의내용과 일치하지않는것은?
Sybilla Masters was the wife of a prominent Philadelphia
merchant. She was also America’s first female inventor. In
1712, she invented a new way to grind corn into meal. Figuring
that this was going to be the next big thing, she was
determined to protect her idea. The State of Pennsylvania
didn’t offer patents at the time, so she set sail for England. It
took Sybilla several years to get what she came for. In the
meantime, she opened a hat store to support herself in London.
What Londoners thought of this energetic female inventor is
largely unrecorded. But in November of 1715, the British
government issued a patent to Thomas Masters for ‘a new
invention found out by Sybilla, his wife.’ Even though it was her
idea, and her years of effort that got the patent, the law
required that it be issued in her husband’s name.
① 옥수수를분쇄하는새로운방법을고안했다.
② 펜실베이니아주가특허권을주지않아영국으로갔다.

④ 그녀에대한런던사람들의생각이기록으로많이남아있다.
⑤ 영국정부는그녀의남편에게특허권을발행했다.
[31~36] 다음 글의빈칸에들어갈말로가장적절한것을고르시오.
31. Imagine that you are lying on a bed in a dental clinic. If you
were told “only two times more” versus “only ten times more,”
wouldn’t you use different mental strategies to try to cope?
With either scenario, you would pull out the comforting thought
of “only one more and then it’s the last one” at different times;
you would save your most distracting fantasy for a different
point. information lets us know what internal
coping strategy is likely to work best during a stressor. A
simple example: you have some minor surgery. You are told
that on the first post-surgical day there is going to be a lot of
pain, whereas by the second day, you will just feel a bit achy.
Armed with that information, you are more likely to plan on
watching distracting videos on the first day and to devote day
two to writing poems.
① Tentative ② Deceptive ③ Predictive
④ Subjective ⑤ Alternative
36. We naturally think in terms of cause and effect. And this
helps organize our experience of the world. We think of
ourselves as seeing some things cause other things to happen,
but in terms of our raw sense experience, we just see certain
things happen before other things, and remember having seen
such before-and-after sequences at earlier times. For
example, a rock hits a window, and then the window breaks.
We don’t see a third thing called causation. But we believe it
has happened. The rock hitting the window caused it to break.
But this is not experienced like the flight of the rock or the
shattering of the glass. Experience does not seem to force the
concept of causation on us. We just use it to interpret what
we experience. Cause and effect are categories that could
never be read out of our experience and must therefore be
to attribute such a connection.
[3점]
① learned from the accumulated knowledge of humankind
② made use of as compensation for our lack of imagination
③ clearly distinguished from each other as separate entities
④ brought to that experience by our prior mental disposition
⑤ considered as independent sensory experiences themselves
37. 다음글의 (A), (B)에 들어갈말로 가장적절한 것은?
Most people who work are used to setting and pursuing
performance goals. Most workers will give you a blank stare if
you ask what their learning goals are, or they will offer up a
performance goal in disguise. (A) , “I would like to
learn to make more money,” and “I would like to learn to break
eighty in golf,” are simply performance goals with the word
learning inserted. How does a learning goal differ from a
performance goal? Performance is something you do that
brings about an observable change in the external world.
Learning, (B) , is a change that takes place within
the learner, although often as a result of interaction with the
external world. Thus a change in understanding based on new
information or on a new interpretation of old information would
be classified as learning.
(A) (B)
① However …… in fact
② However …… as a result
③ Moreover …… instead
④ For example …… in the same way
⑤ For example …… on the other hand

One of the most famous highway illusions, “motion
parallax,” puzzled psychologists long before the car was
invented. This phenomenon can be easily glimpsed when you
look out the side window of a moving car.
(A) Obviously, we cannot make them move, no matter how fast
we may drive. What is happening is that as we fixate on an
object in that landscape, our eyes, to maintain their
fixation, must move in a direction opposite to the way we
are going.
(B) The foreground moves past very quickly, while trees and
other objects farther out seem to move by more slowly,
and things far in the distance, like mountains, seem to
move in the same direction as us.
(C) Wherever we fixate in that view, the things we see before
the point of fixation are moving quickly across our retina
opposite to the direction we are moving in, while things
past the point are moving slowly across our retina in the
same direction as we are traveling.
* retina: 망막

Regrettably, this is not the case― not even for the fastest
sprinters in the world.
For most athletes, maximum speed is reached between
40-60m. Once this is achieved, the challenge is to hold this
speed for as long as possible. ( ① ) Young athletes may run
with the belief that they will run faster and faster until they
reach the finishing line. ( ② ) After 60m, all sprinters start to
slow down. ( ③ ) At both maximum speed and decelerating
speed, the challenge for the runner is to maintain their
technique as long as possible. ( ④ ) Vigorous arm actions,
powerful extensions of the rear leg, and applying sprinting
forces through the ball of the foot will all help to hold the speed
as long as possible. ( ⑤ ) Some people observe that great
sprinters start to pull away from other runners toward the
finishing line― this is because these athletes are not slowing
down as fast as their opponents.

Research done for Sesame Street reveals that children do
not actually watch television continuously, but in bursts.
They tune in just enough to get the gist and be sure it makes
sense. In one key experiment, half the children were shown
the program in a room filled with toys. As expected, the
group with toys was distracted and watched the show only
about 47 percent of the time as opposed to 87 percent in the
group without toys. But when the children were tested for
how much of the show they remembered and understood, the
scores were exactly the same. The researchers were led to
the conclusion that the 5-year-olds in the toys group were
attending quite strategically, distributing their attention
between toy play and viewing so that they looked at what
was for them the most informative part of the program.
In an experiment, children with distracting toys showed
a(n) (A) level of retention and comprehension of a
TV program compared with the ones without toys, which
implies that children get information (B) .
(A) (B)
① identical …… selectively
② identical …… accidentally
③ distinct …… passively
④ proper …… thoroughly
⑤ distinct …… purposely
[41~42] 다음 글을읽고, 물음에답하시오.
In the case of a company, it is common to describe culture
as the visible elements of a working environment: casual
Fridays or free sodas in the cafeteria. But as MIT’s Edgar
Schein explains, those things don’t define a culture. They are
just artifacts of it. According to him, culture is a way of
working together toward common goals that people have
followed so frequently and so successfully that they don’t
even think about trying to do things another way. If a culture
has formed, people will autonomously do what they need to
do to be successful.
Those instincts are not formed overnight. Rather, they are
the result of shared learning. In every organization, there is
that first time when a problem or challenge arises. Those
responsible reach a decision together on what to do and how
to do it in order to succeed. If that decision results in a
successful outcome, then the next time when those
employees face a similar type of challenge, they will return
to the same decision and same way of solving the problem.
As long as the way they have chosen keeps working to
solve the problem, the culture will become an internal set of
rules that people will draw upon in making the choices ahead
of them. They will just assume that the way they have been
doing it is the way of doing it. This causes an organization to
become . Managers don’t need to enforce the
rule. People instinctively get on with what needs to be done.

[43~45] 다음 글을읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
The sun was shining and most people were lightly dressed.
Everyone, except one girl who was standing apart in front of
the entrance of North Valley High School. She wore a
headscarf and she somehow looked like she didn’t belong
here. Our English teacher, Mrs. Brandon, arrived with the
girl wearing the headscarf coming up behind (a) her. The girl
seemed to be afraid and shy and I somehow felt sorry for
her.
(B)
The next day at school we sat next to each other and I
noticed that everyone was staring at (b) her as if she were a
monster. Then I saw Chloe, the captain of the cheerleading
team, coming right up to us saying that it was silly that she
was still wearing a headscarf in such a modern world. Lara
went red and started to stutter. I got angry at Chloe and told
her that she should tolerate other cultures. She turned red
and walked away, and Lara gave me a strong hug. Now Lara
and I are inseparable. (c) She teaches me some things about
her culture and I explain to her how to make popcorn.
(C)
When I was having a short break after the class, Mrs.
Brandon walked towards me and asked whether I could help
Lara with her English homework after school. Two
afternoons later I stood in front of a big house in the middle
of Beverly Hills with her address, which Mrs. Brandon gave
to me. Lara opened the door with a warm welcome, and I
immediately felt comfortable. I realized that (d) she was not
that afraid and shy. The more she told me about her life, the
more I understood her and her views. I lost track of time
talking with her until late night.
(D)
Mrs. Brandon said that her name was Lara and that she
came from the Middle East. Lara was supposed to introduce
herself but as soon as (e) she opened her mouth everyone
started to laugh. She had an accent sounding as if she had
just learned how to speak. Lara blushed and Mrs. Brandon
needed to calm the laughing class. Next to me, the seat was
not taken, the only one, always at the wrong time. She sat
next to me not saying anything and looking down at the floor.
