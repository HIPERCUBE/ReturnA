34. Contentment is not supposed to be the same thing as apathy.
Contentment is emotionally accepting your present as being
what it is, without being filled with resentment, frustration, or
irritation at anything you are undergoing. But that is thoroughly
compatible with . You aspire
to be better or to accomplish more. You are not satisfied to
stay where you are existentially, with no further growth and no
further effects for good on your world. You want to be and do
more. This is the dissatisfaction of aspiration. It can be a very
healthy goad to personal growth and fulfillment. As Saint
Augustine put it, “Be always displeased at what you are, if you
desire to attain to what you are not.” [3점]
