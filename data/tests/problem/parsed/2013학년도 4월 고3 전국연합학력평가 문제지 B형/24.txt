I have always believed your home tells your story. That
tortoise shell on the wall? There was one exactly like it in my
mother’s house and I can’t see it without thinking about a
thousand family dinners. Those cuff links? They belonged to
somebody I loved; we picked them out on one of the most
perfect days we ever spent together. Each object tells a story
and each story connects us to one another and to the world.
The truth is, things matter. They have to. They are what we
live with and touch each and every day. They represent what
we have seen, who we have loved, and where we hope to go
next. They remind us of the good times and the rough patches,
and everything in between that has made us who we are.
① Things we live with are reflections of ourselves.
② Valuable things come when we don’t expect them.
③ Who we are is more important than what we have.
④ Various collections improve the quality of our lives.
⑤ Old memories matter in keeping social relationships.
