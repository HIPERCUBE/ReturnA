36. We naturally think in terms of cause and effect. And this
helps organize our experience of the world. We think of
ourselves as seeing some things cause other things to happen,
but in terms of our raw sense experience, we just see certain
things happen before other things, and remember having seen
such before-and-after sequences at earlier times. For
example, a rock hits a window, and then the window breaks.
We don’t see a third thing called causation. But we believe it
has happened. The rock hitting the window caused it to break.
But this is not experienced like the flight of the rock or the
shattering of the glass. Experience does not seem to force the
concept of causation on us. We just use it to interpret what
we experience. Cause and effect are categories that could
never be read out of our experience and must therefore be
to attribute such a connection.
