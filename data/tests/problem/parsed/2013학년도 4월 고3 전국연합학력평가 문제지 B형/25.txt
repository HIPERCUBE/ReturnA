According to the experts who are happiest in their careers,
most people encounter turning points at which they have a clear
choice. This choice is not, as you might think, “Should I stay or
should I go?” It is often a decision about doing something new
on the job: a training opportunity, an offer to take on new
responsibilities, a chance to move into a new area with which
one is unfamiliar. There are a host of possibilities, but the experts
concur on this one point: say yes. As far as work is concerned,
those experts can point to a decision where they were tempted
to say no, where staying the course was more comfortable and
less risky, but they finally decided to give it a go.
