Dr. John Ross was well­known for helping his patients. 
Many of his patients were poor farmers, and they could not 
always afford to pay Dr. Ross’s small fee. The good doctor 
would accept vegetables, eggs, or even a simple “thank you” 
in payment. One winter afternoon, he went to a house to 
see a child with a fever. The girl’s family had run out of 
the firewood they needed to keep their tiny house warm. Dr. 
Ross grabbed a spare blanket from his car and told the 
father to bathe his daughter’s forehead with cool water. 
Then Dr. Ross left to take care of other patients. After 
setting a broken leg, delivering a baby, and cleaning an 
infected finger, he returned to the sick child’s house with a 
load of firewood. He built a fire for the little girl and her 
family.
