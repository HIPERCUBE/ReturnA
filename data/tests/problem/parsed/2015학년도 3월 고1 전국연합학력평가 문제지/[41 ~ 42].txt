A few years ago, I asked two groups of people to spend 
an afternoon picking up trash in a park. I told them that 
they were participating in an experiment to examine the 
best way to make people take care of their local parks. 
One group was paid very well for their time, but the other 
was only given a small amount of cash. After an hour of 
hard, boring work, everyone rated how much they enjoyed 
the afternoon. You might think that those who earned a lot 
of money would have been more positive than those who 
earned very little.
In fact, the result was the exact opposite. The average 
enjoyment for the well­paid group was only 2 out of 10, 
while the poorly paid group’s average rating was an 
amazing 8.5. It seemed that those who had been paid well 
thought, “Well, people usually pay me to do things I dislike. 
I was paid a large amount, so I must dislike cleaning the 
park.” In contrast, those who received less money thought, 
“I don’t need to be paid much to do something I enjoy. I 
worked for very little pay, so I must have enjoyed cleaning 
the park.” According to the result of this study, it seems 
that giving excessive　　　　　　        　　may have a negative 
effect on the attitude of the people doing the work.
