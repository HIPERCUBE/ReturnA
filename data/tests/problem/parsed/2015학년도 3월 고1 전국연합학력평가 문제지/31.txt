31. Armand Hammer was a great businessman who died in 
1990 at the age of ninety­two. He was once asked how a 
man of his age had the energy to continually travel the world 
to do business and meet with heads of governments. He said, 
“I love my work. I can’t wait to start a new day. I never 
wake up without being full of ideas. Everything is a 
challenge.” George Bernard Shaw, one of the most successful 
writers of all time, said something similar about a hundred 
years earlier. He wrote, “I want to be thoroughly used up 
when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live.” I think 
Hammer and Shaw would have agreed with me that nothing 
can replace                  in life. [3점]
