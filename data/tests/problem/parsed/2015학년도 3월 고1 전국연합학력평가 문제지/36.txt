36.
I took a job on the night shift because the money was 
much better.
(A) I took a slightly longer break than usual and my boss 
wasn’t too happy about that. So, we couldn’t do it very 
often, but I loved it when they came.
(B) Unfortunately, working at night meant I could no longer 
have dinner with my wife and kids. A sandwich in the 
cafeteria isn’t exactly the same thing as a hot meal at 
home.
(C) One night, my wife surprised me by packing up the kids 
a n d dinner and coming to see me at work. The five of 
us sat around the cafeteria table and it was the best 
meal I’d had in a long time.
