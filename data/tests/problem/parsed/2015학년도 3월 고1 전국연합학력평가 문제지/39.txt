This is not the case for people who live in the suburbs.
For the most part, people who live or work in cities walk 
throughout the day ― to go from the parking lot to the office, 
to shop, and to run errands. ( ① ) It’s often easier and 
cheaper to walk a few blocks than to wait for a taxi or 
subway. ( ② ) In this way, exercise can be structured into 
the daily routine. ( ③ ) Because the suburbs are spread out, 
it’s too far to walk to the office or run to the store. ( ④ ) 
Walking to the bus stop used to provide at least some 
movement, but now most public transportation is limited, so 
suburban people drive everywhere. ( ⑤ ) The price they pay 
is limited physical movement during the day.
