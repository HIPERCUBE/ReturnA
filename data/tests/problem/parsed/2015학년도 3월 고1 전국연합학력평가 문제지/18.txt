My dear Harriet, 
I was so delighted to receive your letter and to 
learn that you have been accepted to Royal 
Holloway. It’s a good college and I know that the 
history department there is particularly strong. I 
can see why it was your first choice, and I am 
very pleased for you. You worked hard to enter 
that college, and you deserve your success. I’m so 
proud of you. Well done, Harriet! I send you my 
best wishes for a happy time at university.
With my love, 
Elaine
