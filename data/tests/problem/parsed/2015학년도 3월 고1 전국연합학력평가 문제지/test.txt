My dear Harriet, 
I was so delighted to receive your letter and to 
learn that you have been accepted to Royal 
Holloway. It’s a good college and I know that the

Some people need money more than we do. For example, 
some people have lost their homes due to natural disasters 
or war, while others don’t have enough food or clothing. So 
this year, for our birthdays, let’s tell our friends and family 
to donate money to a charity instead of buying us presents. 
I know that some kids might not want to give up their 
birthday presents, and I understand. However, remember that 
we can live without new toys or games more easily than 
someone can live without food, clothing, or shelter. So, we 
should tell our friends and family that, for our birthdays this 
year, we want to give to others.
① 생일 파티를 간소하게 하자.
② 부모님께 감사하는 마음을 갖자.

⑤ 생일 선물에 드는 비용으로 어려운 사람을 돕자.
20. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
When you skip breakfast, you are like a car trying to run 
without fuel. Experts say that a nutritious breakfast is the 
brain’s fuel. A brain that is fully fueled concentrates better 
and solves problems faster. Some students say that getting a 
few extra minutes of sleep is more important than eating a 
bowl of oatmeal, but they’re wrong. Of course, sleeping is 
important, but going to bed a half­hour earlier would be 
better than sleeping late and skipping breakfast. For students 
who want to do well in school, breakfast is the most 
important meal of the day. Give your brain the fuel it needs 
to run well. To think more clearly and faster, eat a good 
breakfast.

21. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Dr. John Ross was well­known for helping his patients. 
Many of his patients were poor farmers, and they could not 
always afford to pay Dr. Ross’s small fee. The good doctor 
would accept vegetables, eggs, or even a simple “thank you” 
in payment. One winter afternoon, he went to a house to 
see a child with a fever. The girl’s family had run out of 
the firewood they needed to keep their tiny house warm. Dr. 
Ross grabbed a spare blanket from his car and told the 
father to bathe his daughter’s forehead with cool water. 
Then Dr. Ross left to take care of other patients. After 
setting a broken leg, delivering a baby, and cleaning an 
infected finger, he returned to the sick child’s house with a 
load of firewood. He built a fire for the little girl and her 
family.

22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
Problems can appear to be unsolvable. We are social 
animals who need to discuss our problems with others. 
When we are alone, problems become more serious. By 
sharing, we can get opinions and find solutions. An 
experiment was conducted with a group of women who had 
low satisfaction in life. Some of the women were introduced 
to others who were in similar situations, and some of the 
women were left on their own to deal with their concerns. 
Those who interacted with others reduced their concerns by 
55 percent over time, but those who were left on their own 
showed no improvement.

23. 다음 글에 드러난 Ester의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Ester awoke one morning to the sound of a heavily 
pouring April shower. She looked out her window and saw 
the rain slowly beginning to fade. A brilliant curved arc of 
colors crossed the sky. It was a beautiful rainbow. Ester 
leaped from her bed with delight, dashed into the living 
room, and shouted, “Mom, come here. Look at this beautiful 
rainbow! It is gorgeous!” “Ester, calm down,” her mother 
said, as she followed her daughter to the window where she 
could see the rainbow. And there it was! A brilliance of 
beautiful colors that lit up the sky! It was the first rainbow 
that Ester had ever seen.
* arc: 둥근[활] 모양

24. addax에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The addax is a kind of antelope found in some areas in 
the Sahara Desert. It has twisted horns and short, thick 
legs. It is an endangered mammal and there are only about 
500 left in the wild. The head and body length of the addax 
measures 150 - 170 centimeters. Males are slightly taller 
than females. The coat of the addax changes in color 
depending on the season. In winter, the addax is 
grayish­brown with white legs. During summer, their coat 
gets lighter, and is almost completely white. The addax 
prefers sandy desert areas and stony deserts. The addax is 
mostly active at night due to the heat of the desert.

One cool thing about my Uncle Arthur was ① what he could 
always pick the best places to camp. One time, we went to 
Garrison Rock. Uncle Arthur said that the Indians stayed 
there. On trips like this, he would always have a good story 
② to tell. His stories were always aimed at ③ helping us

one story was about a guy being ④ chased by a big dog. 
They ran into a field. We kids were thinking that the dog

The laser pointer, which became popular in the 1990s, was at 
first typically thick to hold in the hand. Before long, such pointers 
came in slimmer pocket models and became easier to handle. Still, 
the laser pointer had its own (A) strengths / weaknesses . 
Batteries were required and had to be replaced, and the shaky 
hand movements of a nervous lecturer were (B) hidden / shown  
in the sudden motion of the glowing red dot. Moreover, the red 
dot could be difficult to see against certain backgrounds, thus 
making the laser pointer (C) inferior / superior  even to a simple 
stick. To correct this problem, more advanced and thus more 
expensive green­beam laser pointers came to be introduced.
(A) (B) (C)
① strengths …… shown …… inferior
② strengths …… hidden …… superior
③ weaknesses …… shown …… superior
④ weaknesses …… hidden …… superior
⑤ weaknesses …… shown …… inferior

31. Armand Hammer was a great businessman who died in 
1990 at the age of ninety­two. He was once asked how a 
man of his age had the energy to continually travel the world 
to do business and meet with heads of governments. He said, 
“I love my work. I can’t wait to start a new day. I never 
wake up without being full of ideas. Everything is a 
challenge.” George Bernard Shaw, one of the most successful 
writers of all time, said something similar about a hundred 
years earlier. He wrote, “I want to be thoroughly used up 
when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live.” I think 
Hammer and Shaw would have agreed with me that nothing 
can replace                  in life. [3점]

① hard work
② true friendship
③ good education

32. Let me give you a piece of advice that might change your 
mind about                   . Suppose that your doctor 
said that you have six months to live and recommended that 
you do everything you ever wanted to do. What would you 
do? Have you always wanted to sky dive, or climb cliffs, or 
maybe live alone in the woods for a month but been afraid 
you might be harmed? What difference would it make if you 
now attempted it? You’d almost certainly live through it and 
it would enrich the time you had left. Wouldn’t it be nice to 
go out saying you had faced all your fears? Why do you 
wait till you have a death sentence? If it’s that important to 
you, do it now. [3점]
* death sentence: 사형 선고
① being courageous
② helping others
③ making friends
④ recovering health
⑤ encouraging patients
33. It is not always easy to eat well when you have a 
newborn baby. It can seem like you do not have time to 
prepare tasty nutritious meals or even to eat them. You will 
need to learn the following trick. Try not to wait until  
. When you have a newborn baby, 
preparing food will probably take longer than usual. If you 
start when you are already hungry, you will be absolutely 
starving before the food is ready. When you are starving 
and tired, eating healthy is difficult. You may want to eat 
fatty fast food, chocolates, cookies or chips. This type of 
food is okay sometimes, but not every day. [3점]
① your baby cries to be fed at night
② you find a new recipe for your meal
③ you are really hungry to think about eating
④ your kids finish all the food on their plates
⑤ you feel like taking a nap after a heavy meal

All living languages change, but the rate of change varies 
from time to time and from language to language.  
(A)  , the modern Icelander does not find it very 
difficult to read the Icelandic sagas from the Middle Ages. 
This is because the rate of change in Icelandic has always 
been slow, ever since the country was ruled by Norwegians a 
thousand years ago and Icelandic history began.    (B)   , 
the English find an English document of the year 1300 very

Music study enriches all the learning ― in reading, math, 
and other subjects ― that children do at school. ① It also 
helps to develop language and communication skills. ② As 
children grow, musical training continues to help them 
develop the discipline and self­confidence needed to 
achieve in school. ③ Studying while listening to music 
causes students to have a difficult time learning the 
material. ④ The day­to­day practice in music, along with 
setting goals and reaching them, develops self­discipline, 
patience, and responsibility. ⑤ That discipline carries over 
to other areas, such as doing homework and other school

I took a job on the night shift because the money was 
much better.
(A) I took a slightly longer break than usual and my boss 
wasn’t too happy about that. So, we couldn’t do it very 
often, but I loved it when they came.
(B) Unfortunately, working at night meant I could no longer 
have dinner with my wife and kids. A sandwich in the 
cafeteria isn’t exactly the same thing as a hot meal at 
home.
(C) One night, my wife surprised me by packing up the kids

Detective work is a two­part process. First, a detective 
must find the clues. But the clues alone don’t solve the 
case.
(A) The same sort of process takes place in reading. You 
need to look for clues and then draw conclusions based 
on those clues.
(B) What is the writer trying to say? Good conclusions 
come from good observations. To be a better reader, be 
more like Sherlock Holmes: be more observant.
(C) The detective must also draw conclusions based on 
those clues. These conclusions are also called 
inferences. Inferences are conclusions based on reasons, 
facts, or evidence.

However, shoppers should understand that getting any of 
these sources of information has costs.  
Shoppers usually have a limited amount of money to spend 
and a limited amount of time to shop. ( ① ) It is important to 
realize that shopping is really a search for information. ( ② ) 
You may obtain information from an advertisement, a friend, a 
salesperson, a label, a magazine article, the Internet, or 
several other sources. ( ③ ) You may also gain information 
from actual use of the product, such as trying on a dress, 
test­driving a car, or taking advantage of a promotion at a 
fitness center. ( ④ ) These costs may include transportation 
costs and time. ( ⑤ ) Only you can decide whether to take 
the costs or not.

This is not the case for people who live in the suburbs.
For the most part, people who live or work in cities walk 
throughout the day ― to go from the parking lot to the office, 
to shop, and to run errands. ( ① ) It’s often easier and 
cheaper to walk a few blocks than to wait for a taxi or 
subway. ( ② ) In this way, exercise can be structured into 
the daily routine. ( ③ ) Because the suburbs are spread out, 
it’s too far to walk to the office or run to the store. ( ④ ) 
Walking to the bus stop used to provide at least some 
movement, but now most public transportation is limited, so 
suburban people drive everywhere. ( ⑤ ) The price they pay 
is limited physical movement during the day.

(B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
Natural boundaries between states or countries are 
found along rivers, lakes, deserts, and mountain ranges. 
Among them, river boundaries would seem to be ideal: 
they provide clear separation, and they are established and 
recognized physical features. In reality, however, river 
boundaries can change as rivers change course. Following 
flooding, a river’s course may shift, altering the boundary 
between states or countries. For example, the Rio Grande, 
separating the United States and Mexico, has frequently 
shifted its course, causing problems in determining the exact location of the international boundary.
* boundary: 경계

A river seems to be ideal in (A)  boundaries, but 
in fact it isn’t, because its course is (B) .

A few years ago, I asked two groups of people to spend 
an afternoon picking up trash in a park. I told them that 
they were participating in an experiment to examine the 
best way to make people take care of their local parks. 
One group was paid very well for their time, but the other 
was only given a small amount of cash. After an hour of 
hard, boring work, everyone rated how much they enjoyed 
the afternoon. You might think that those who earned a lot 
of money would have been more positive than those who 
earned very little.
In fact, the result was the exact opposite. The average 
enjoyment for the well­paid group was only 2 out of 10, 
while the poorly paid group’s average rating was an 
amazing 8.5. It seemed that those who had been paid well 
thought, “Well, people usually pay me to do things I dislike. 
I was paid a large amount, so I must dislike cleaning the 
park.” In contrast, those who received less money thought, 
“I don’t need to be paid much to do something I enjoy. I 
worked for very little pay, so I must have enjoyed cleaning 
the park.” According to the result of this study, it seems 
that giving excessive　　　　　　        　　may have a negative 
effect on the attitude of the people doing the work.

My husband David called me on my cell phone the week 
before our daughter’s wedding and said, “We have a

generator parked right outside of our house ―it was (a) her 
solution. That’s right ―our house was connected to electricity 
all day from our own private generator while the rest of the 
neighborhood had a blackout! It was amazing. Rosa made it 
clear that our happiness was important to (b) her as well. 
There are truly people with big hearts. Kindness is still alive.
* generator: 발전기
(C)
I called the electric company to ask, or rather to beg, 
them to put off the repair work since we really, really 
needed our house to prepare for the wedding (makeup, 
hair, etc.). I was immediately transferred to a manager 
named Rosa. She understood the problem and explained 
that they absolutely couldn’t reschedule the power outage, 
but (c) she would see what she could do.
(D)
Two days later, Rosa called to say that they could not 
let only our house keep its electricity. Then she said, 
“We can let you use a room in our company’s building.” I 
was surprised and asked if (d) she had ever done that. 
She said, “Actually, it’s happened before.” The next day, 
Rosa called again in a happy voice and said that she had 
found a solution. She told me that my daughter would be 
able to use electricity and prepare for (e) her wedding at 
home.
