Detective work is a two­part process. First, a detective 
must find the clues. But the clues alone don’t solve the 
case.
(A) The same sort of process takes place in reading. You 
need to look for clues and then draw conclusions based 
on those clues.
(B) What is the writer trying to say? Good conclusions 
come from good observations. To be a better reader, be 
more like Sherlock Holmes: be more observant.
(C) The detective must also draw conclusions based on 
those clues. These conclusions are also called 
inferences. Inferences are conclusions based on reasons, 
facts, or evidence.
