When you skip breakfast, you are like a car trying to run 
without fuel. Experts say that a nutritious breakfast is the 
brain’s fuel. A brain that is fully fueled concentrates better 
and solves problems faster. Some students say that getting a 
few extra minutes of sleep is more important than eating a 
bowl of oatmeal, but they’re wrong. Of course, sleeping is 
important, but going to bed a half­hour earlier would be 
better than sleeping late and skipping breakfast. For students 
who want to do well in school, breakfast is the most 
important meal of the day. Give your brain the fuel it needs 
to run well. To think more clearly and faster, eat a good 
breakfast.
