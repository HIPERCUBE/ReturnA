(A)
My husband David called me on my cell phone the week 
before our daughter’s wedding and said, “We have a 
problem.” He told me that the electric company announced 
a future power outage in our neighborhood to allow for a 
major repair. The real problem was that we were going to 
have the power outage on the day of the wedding.
* power outage: 정전
(B)
So we got up early on Sunday morning, and found a 
generator parked right outside of our house ―it was (a) her 
solution. That’s right ―our house was connected to electricity 
all day from our own private generator while the rest of the 
neighborhood had a blackout! It was amazing. Rosa made it 
clear that our happiness was important to (b) her as well. 
There are truly people with big hearts. Kindness is still alive.
* generator: 발전기
(C)
I called the electric company to ask, or rather to beg, 
them to put off the repair work since we really, really 
needed our house to prepare for the wedding (makeup, 
hair, etc.). I was immediately transferred to a manager 
named Rosa. She understood the problem and explained 
that they absolutely couldn’t reschedule the power outage, 
but (c) she would see what she could do.
(D)
Two days later, Rosa called to say that they could not 
let only our house keep its electricity. Then she said, 
“We can let you use a room in our company’s building.” I 
was surprised and asked if (d) she had ever done that. 
She said, “Actually, it’s happened before.” The next day, 
Rosa called again in a happy voice and said that she had 
found a solution. She told me that my daughter would be 
able to use electricity and prepare for (e) her wedding at 
home.
