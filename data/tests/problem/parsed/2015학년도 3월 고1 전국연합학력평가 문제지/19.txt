Some people need money more than we do. For example, 
some people have lost their homes due to natural disasters 
or war, while others don’t have enough food or clothing. So 
this year, for our birthdays, let’s tell our friends and family 
to donate money to a charity instead of buying us presents. 
I know that some kids might not want to give up their 
birthday presents, and I understand. However, remember that 
we can live without new toys or games more easily than 
someone can live without food, clothing, or shelter. So, we 
should tell our friends and family that, for our birthdays this 
year, we want to give to others.
