32. Let me give you a piece of advice that might change your 
mind about                   . Suppose that your doctor 
said that you have six months to live and recommended that 
you do everything you ever wanted to do. What would you 
do? Have you always wanted to sky dive, or climb cliffs, or 
maybe live alone in the woods for a month but been afraid 
you might be harmed? What difference would it make if you 
now attempted it? You’d almost certainly live through it and 
it would enrich the time you had left. Wouldn’t it be nice to 
go out saying you had faced all your fears? Why do you 
wait till you have a death sentence? If it’s that important to 
you, do it now. [3점]
