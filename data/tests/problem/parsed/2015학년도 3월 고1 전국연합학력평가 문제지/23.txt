Ester awoke one morning to the sound of a heavily 
pouring April shower. She looked out her window and saw 
the rain slowly beginning to fade. A brilliant curved arc of 
colors crossed the sky. It was a beautiful rainbow. Ester 
leaped from her bed with delight, dashed into the living 
room, and shouted, “Mom, come here. Look at this beautiful 
rainbow! It is gorgeous!” “Ester, calm down,” her mother 
said, as she followed her daughter to the window where she 
could see the rainbow. And there it was! A brilliance of 
beautiful colors that lit up the sky! It was the first rainbow 
that Ester had ever seen.
