One cool thing about my Uncle Arthur was ① what he could 
always pick the best places to camp. One time, we went to 
Garrison Rock. Uncle Arthur said that the Indians stayed 
there. On trips like this, he would always have a good story 
② to tell. His stories were always aimed at ③ helping us 
children use our brains to get out of trouble. For example, 
one story was about a guy being ④ chased by a big dog. 
They ran into a field. We kids were thinking that the dog 
would catch him. But the guy saw a bathtub in the field. He 
ran to the bathtub and ⑤ pulled it over himself. The dog just 
barked and barked until it went away. Then the guy came out 
of the bathtub, and went home.
