Dear Mayor Stevenson:
I am writing to inform you about the situation of my 
son’s school due to the budget cuts. Since the cuts 
were made, the number of police officers on duty to 
direct traffic at Central Elementary School during the 
afternoons has decreased from two to one. Many 
parents are greatly concerned for the safety of our 
children as they walk through the area that we once 
considered safe. Central is now the only elementary 
school in the district that does not have a police 
officer at every entrance. We find this fact to be very 
unfair. We need one additional police officer who can 
make sure that our children make their way home 
safely.
Thank you for your prompt attention in advance.
Sincerely,
Juliet Darcy
