Most universities have students fill out an evaluation of 
every course they take. The results are often made publicly 
available and can be a good guide to the best classes. In 
fact, a large number of studies have shown some of the 
benefits of these evaluations. In the first place, they are 
reliable; students tend to agree with each other on which 
classes are good and even ten years later still rate the same 
classes highly. They also appear to be correlated with 
performance; students perform better in classes they rate 
highly. In one study, two professors taught the same class 
and gave identical exams; students taught by the professor 
with higher evaluations performed better on the exam.
