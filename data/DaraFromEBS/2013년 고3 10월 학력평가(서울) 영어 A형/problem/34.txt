34. The most persuasive speakers, marketers, and leaders 
always frame their messages first in                    to 
get the “buy in” of the unconscious mind. Only after the 
immediate concerns of the unconscious have been satisfied 
can the conscious mind begin to be convinced of, or 
interested in, anything. Most politicians say, “I will do 
such­and­such if elected.” But we can’t think about that type 
of an uncertain future; we can only process the “now.” 
Similarly, marketers have found some phrases such as “get 
started today” and “immediate delivery” to be very powerful. 
Telling someone “It’ll be ready in a month,” or “It usually 
takes eight weeks for delivery,” will make the sale much 
more difficult. [3점]
