assume that television has destroyed family conversation: 
not only can documentaries, soap operas and other programs 
spark lively discussion among family members, but watching

discussion with your spouse about whether she should leave 
her job if you are both half­watching TV? While television 
has potential to stimulate the mind and emotions, it is 
essentially a passive medium which draws us away from 
human interaction, whereas conversation is in essence an 
active form of engagement with others. [3점]
