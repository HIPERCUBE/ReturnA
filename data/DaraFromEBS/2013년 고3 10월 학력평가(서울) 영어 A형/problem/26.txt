One spring morning I paused beside a park fountain to 
watch the spray change the sunlight into beautiful rainbows. 
A young mother, followed by a tiny blond girl, came 
hurrying along the path. When the child saw the fountain, 
she threw her arms wide. “Mommy, wait!” she cried. “See 
all the pretty colors!” The mother reached for her daughter’s 
hand. “Come on,” she urged. “We’ll miss our bus!” Then 
seeing the joy on the small face, she said, “All right, there’ll 
be another bus soon.” As she knelt with her arms around 
the child, joy filled the mother’s face too ― that rare and 
special joy of sharing something lovely with someone we 
love. Since that day, I’ve found that the happiest children 
belong to families rich in rainbows shared.
