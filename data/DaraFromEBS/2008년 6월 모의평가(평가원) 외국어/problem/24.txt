24. Magicians are honest deceivers. To investigate the secret 
used by magicians to fool their audiences, Jastrow worked 
with two great illusionists. He invited these performers to 
his laboratory and had them participate in a range of tests 
measuring their speed of movement and accuracy of finger 
motion. But Jastrow’s results revealed little out of the 
ordinary. He demonstrated magic has little to do with fast 
movements. Instead, magicians use a range of ___________
weapons to fool their audiences. The technique of 
suggestion, which captures people’s minds, plays a key 
role in the process. In the same way that people can be 
made to believe that they once went on a non-existent trip 
in a hot-air balloon, so magicians have to be able to 
manipulate people’s perception of performance.
