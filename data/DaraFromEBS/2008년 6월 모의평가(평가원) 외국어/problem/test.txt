This is an old word that translates as “scholar” or 
“intellectual” in the sense of someone who exhibits all of 
the most admirable virtues attributed to Confucianism, 
especially during the Joseon Dynasty. He was presented 
as the ideal human being who was selfless and  
disciplined. So, he was held up as a model of morality 
for all people in the Confucian society. He was also 
dedicated to the prosperity of the nation in politics and 
philosophy. In modern Korean society, scholars are still 
expected to keep the spirit that such a man had. However, 
in reality, it is very hard to live up to such ideals.
① 선비 ② 농부 ③ 장인
④ 상인 ⑤ 노비

Greg had always loved sports that he could play on his 
own. When he was 14, ① he went to a camp for skiers. 
One of the best ways to stay in shape, he was told there, 
was cycling. At that time, his dad was trying to lose 
weight, so ② he rode 20 miles every day with his son. 
Soon Greg got interested in cycling, entered races for 14 
and 15-year-olds, and won almost every race. ③ He 
became unbeatable in the U.S. However, being number 
one in the U.S. didn’t count for much because all the 
top cyclists raced in Europe. When ④ he was 16, Greg 
started racing and winning in Europe. And when he was 
25, ⑤ he became the first non-European to win the Tour 
de France, the top cycling competition in the world.

Welcome and thank you for joining the dining club. 
Our club offers a unique dining experience. You will be 
trying food from all over the world, but more importantly, 
you will have the chance to experience each country’s 
dining traditions and customs. In India, for example, they 
use their hands to eat. If you are used to using forks and 
knives, you may find this challenging. In France, dinners 
have many courses, so make sure to schedule enough 
time for the French meal. In Japan, they don’t eat their 
soup with a spoon, so you have to drink directly from 
the bowl. These are some of the things you will 
experience every Saturday evening until the end of 
August. We hope you will enjoy your dining adventure.

21. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 어법에 맞는 표현으로 가장 
적절한 것은?
The most useful thing I brought out of my childhood 
was confidence in reading. Not long ago, I went on a 
weekend self-exploratory workshop, in the hope of getting a 
clue about how to live. One of the exercises we were given 
(A) was / were to make a list of the ten most important 
events of our lives. Number one was: “I was born,” and 
you could put (B) however / whatever you liked after that. 
Without even thinking about it, my hand wrote at number 
two: “I learned to read.” “I was born and learned to 
read” wouldn’t be a sequence that occurs to many 
people, I imagine. But I knew what I meant to say. 
Being born was something (C) done / doing to me, but 
my own life began when I first made out the meaning of 
a sentence.
(A)   (B) (C)
① was …… however …… done
② was …… whatever …… done
③ was …… whatever …… doing
④ were …… however …… doing
⑤ were …… however …… done
22. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
Gas stations are a good example of an impersonal 
attitude. At many stations, attendants have even stopped 
① pumping gas. Motorists pull up to a gas station where 
an attendant is ② enclosed in a glass booth with a tray 
for taking money. The driver must get out of the car, 
pump the gas, and ③ walk over to the booth to pay. And 
customers with engine trouble or a non-functioning heater 
are ④ usually out of luck. Why? Many gas stations have 
gotten rid of on-duty mechanics. The skillful mechanic 
has been replaced by a teenager in a uniform ⑤ which 
doesn’t know anything about cars and couldn’t care less.

23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은? 
Doubtless, the capacity for contact has a determining 
influence on health. People with greater capacity for contact 
have a stronger immune system than those less able to 
establish relationships with others. ① One study directly 
measured individuals’ sociability in relation to the 
efficiency of their immune systems. ② Questionnaires and 
interviews given to 334 people examined their sociability―
the quantity and quality of their relationships in everyday 
life. ③ Researchers didn’t know how to obtain a 
representative sample of the population. ④ These people 
were then exposed to a common cold virus. ⑤ It was 
found that the more sociable a person was, the less 
subject he was to contagion.
* contagion: 감염

24. Magicians are honest deceivers. To investigate the secret 
used by magicians to fool their audiences, Jastrow worked 
with two great illusionists. He invited these performers to 
his laboratory and had them participate in a range of tests 
measuring their speed of movement and accuracy of finger 
motion. But Jastrow’s results revealed little out of the 
ordinary. He demonstrated magic has little to do with fast 
movements. Instead, magicians use a range of ___________
weapons to fool their audiences. The technique of 
suggestion, which captures people’s minds, plays a key 
role in the process. In the same way that people can be 
made to believe that they once went on a non-existent trip 
in a hot-air balloon, so magicians have to be able to 
manipulate people’s perception of performance. 
① ethical ② political ③ physical
④ economic ⑤ psychological
25. In traditional societies, high status may have been 
extremely hard to acquire, but it was also comfortingly 
hard to lose. It was as difficult to stop being a lord as, 
more darkly, it was to cease being a servant. What 
mattered was one’s identity at birth, rather than anything 
one might achieve in one’s lifetime through the exercise 
of one’s abilities. The great aspiration of modern 
societies, however, has been to reverse this equation― to 
strip away both inherited privilege and inherited 
under-privilege in order to make rank dependent on 
individual achievement. Status in the current society 
rarely depends on ____________________ handed down 
through the generations.
① immediate insight ② learned behavior
③ an unchangeable identity ④ available information
⑤ a personal accomplishment
26. I enjoy shopping at FW Whole Foods nearly as much as 
I enjoy browsing a good bookstore. It’s the inspiring 
expressions that elevate the food into a more exciting 
experience, one with artistic, emotional, and even political 
dimensions. On a recent visit I filled my shopping cart 
with eggs “from cage-free vegetarian hens,” milk from 
cows that live “free from unnecessary fear,” and tomatoes 
from HSR Farm, “one of the early pioneers of the organic 
movement.” In this regard, shopping at FW Whole Foods 
is a _______________. Indeed, every time I shop in FW 
Whole Foods, I think that this is a place where the skills 
of a literary critic might come in handy―perhaps also a 
journalist’s.
① boring chore ② literary experience
③ traditional custom ④ competitive activity
⑤ depressing event
27. Kate and her classmate, Jamie, were the youngest of the 
winning teams in the Stop Racism National Video 
Competition in 1998. Their submission depicted children 
playing at a nursery accompanied by messages such as 
“Everyone is the same; all these babies are beautiful.” 
Kate says the point of their video was to show that human 
beings are not genetically coded with racist attitudes. 
“_____________________________,” she explains. And she 
adds, “The children at the nursery don’t say, ‘I am not 
playing with you since you’re black,’ because they don’t 
really know about racism.” According to Kate, education 
begins with the younger generation. And if they grow up 
experiencing all sorts of cultures, they have less bias. [3점]
① Cultures are very important for winning the competition 
② Different skin colors give a bad impression to babies
③ Babies should be taken care of in domestic surroundings
④ Children pick up racist ideas from their surroundings as 
they grow up
⑤ Educational institutes are free from racism due to the 
government’s efforts
28. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 
적절한 것은? 
The key to a successful business chain can be 
expressed in one word: “uniformity.” In the early 1970s, 
a farm activist viewed the (A) emerging / declining 
fast-food industry as a step toward a food economy 
dominated by giant corporations. Much of what he 
worried about has come to pass. The tremendous success 
of the fast-food industry has caused other industries to 
(B) avoid / adopt similar business methods. The basic 
thinking behind fast food has become the operating 
system of today’s economy, wiping out small business 
and (C) eliminating / encouraging regional differences. So 
if you walk into a world-famous fast-food restaurant 
anywhere in the world, you can purchase food with 
almost the same taste.

  (A) (B)  (C)
① emerging …… avoid …… encouraging
② emerging …… adopt …… eliminating
③ emerging …… adopt …… encouraging
④ declining …… adopt …… encouraging
⑤ declining …… avoid …… eliminating

적절하지 않은 것은? [3점]

A screw is a simple mechanical device that multiplies 
effort. The force that you apply to the screw is called the 
effort force, whereas the force that applies to the object in 
response to the effort force is called the output force. The 
① spiral ridges are the threads of the screw. The distance 
from ② head to thread is called the pitch. The diagram 
shows how turning the head of the screw can cause the 
screw to ③ move into the object. The distance ④ around 
the head of the screw is related to the distance the effort 
moves. The distance through which the output moves 
corresponds to the ⑤ pitch of the screw.
* ridge: 융기(돌출부분)
30. 다음 글에 드러난 Jonathan의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
“Hey,” Jonathan said, his voice causing two small birds 
to take flight. The woman did not acknowledge him at 
all but continued to sketch. Frowning, he said a little 
louder, “Hey, lady.” Again she did not acknowledge him, 
and Jonathan began to wonder if she might be deaf. 
Purposefully, he walked up to the woman with every 
intention of telling her to leave from his backyard. She 
did not even look up at him until he was standing within 
a couple of feet of her. Only then did she look up. For 
a moment Jonathan was struck by the most amazing 
green eyes he had ever seen. He opened his mouth, but 
instead of the sharp order he had intended to bark, he 
asked quietly, “Who are you?” The woman smiled and 
he felt as if she lit up the world around her. 
① lonely → pleased ② indifferent → worried 
③ annoyed → fascinated ④ frightened → ashamed
⑤ discouraged → confident 
31. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은? 
We’re always seeking the next opportunity for something 
big. If you talk to a cab driver in Manhattan, you’re likely to 
find that he’s going to school to get a better job.    (A)   , 
if you meet a waitress in Southern California, she’s likely 
to tell you that she has an audition for a movie next week. 
The cab driver might never get out of his cab and the 
waitress might be serving food for the next twenty years, but 
the sense that they’re moving toward something more 
glamorous is very important to them personally.     (B)    , 
those who fail to act, who accept the limitations of their 
work without complaining, are likely to feel miserable 
about their lives. The hopelessness of their jobs has done 
critical damage to their identities.
(A)       (B)
① Likewise …… On the other hand
② Likewise …… To begin with
③ On the contrary …… At the same time
④ On the contrary …… Therefore
⑤ As a result …… In other words

32. It is around the age of ten or eleven that most children 
take on music as a real interest. By the age of eighteen or 
twenty, most people form their tastes for music. We seek 
out different kinds of music, and the choice of music has 
important social consequences. We listen to the music that 
our friends listen to. In search of our identity, we form 
bonds or social groups with people whom we want to be 
like. As a way of externalizing the bond, we listen to the 
same kind of music, and music becomes a mark of 
personal and group identity and of distinction.
① the relation of music to social identity
② the use of music for emotional therapy
③ the effect of music on intelligence
④ the necessity of music education
⑤ the classification of pop music
33. In recent years, knitting has become increasingly popular 
with the younger generation. Why are so many young 
people taking up knitting as a hobby? Knitting is 
skill-oriented with the chance for them to take on 
increasingly harder challenges and to get intense 
satisfaction from accomplishing them. And in today’s 
world, where teenagers are looking for unique ways to 
express themselves, handmade clothes and accessories can 
be a smart, creative way for them to express their 
individual personalities. Despite what most people believe, 
many of today’s kids have longer attention spans than we 
think; and they are passionate about creating not just 
personal websites, but also attractive, useful knit products 
that mark their presence in the world.

34. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Sometimes you work as hard as you can on something, 
and it doesn’t work out. I usually persist longer than most 
people would in a similar situation―which is why I often 
succeed where others have failed. I also know that 
sometimes you have to throw in the towel. I remember 
one project I spent weeks working on at my architecture 
firm. I spent many late nights trying to perfect my design, 
but it just wasn’t coming together. I finally realized that I 
had to start over from scratch. Maybe you have failed in 
similar situations, but you probably learned something 
valuable. Add it up to experience, don’t take it personally, 
and go find your next challenge!  
① 할 일에 대한 사전 분석을 철저히 하라.
② 실패하더라도 좌절하지 말고 다시 시작하라.
③ 난관에 부딪쳤을 때 타인의 조언을 받아들여라.
④ 거절해야 할 때는 그 이유를 명확히 밝혀라.
⑤ 사소한 일이라도 완벽을 추구하라.
35. 유전자 변형 작물(transgenic crop)의 이점에 대한 다음 
도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 문장은?
The above chart shows the economic advantage of 
transgenic cotton farming over conventional farming in four 
countries in 2003. ① In all the countries, the seed cost for 
the transgenic crop was higher than that for the conventional 
one. However, lower pesticide costs, higher yields, and 
higher revenues made the transgenic crop more profitable. 
② The profit ratio varied from country to country. ③ In 
Argentina, the ratio of the transgenic seed cost to the cost of 
the conventional one was higher than that of the other 
countries. ④ In South Africa, the profit ratio of the transgenic 
crop to the conventional one was the highest, followed by 
China. ⑤ Among the nations, Mexico’s crop produced the 
lowest ratios in yield and prof it as compared to the 
conventional one.
* pesticide: 살충제 ** revenue: 총수익
36. “Primitive people”의 언어에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은? 
Some people think the languages of so-called primitive 
peoples are so simple that they have limited vocabularies 
of only a few hundred words. This is not the case. Like 
other languages, these languages usually have only as 
many words as the people need to express themselves. 
They may lack the scientific and technical words of the 
more “civilized” languages, such as English. But their 
words for tools, animals, plants, and other everyday things 
run into the thousands. Dictionaries written for the Navaho 
Indians, for example, list 11,000 Navaho words; for the 
African Zulus, 17,000; for the Dakota Indians, 19,000; for 
the Maya Indians of Mexico and Central America, 20,000.
① 자기 표현에 필요한 어휘가 부족하다.
② 과학과 기술 관련 어휘가 영어 못지않게 풍부하다.
③ 도구, 동식물, 일상과 관련된 어휘 수가 수천에 달한다.
④ 어휘 사전이 존재하지 않는다.
⑤ 마야 인디언의 어휘 수가 가장 적다.
37. Jorge Luis Borges에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Jorge Luis Borges, the most influential short-story 
writer in Latin America, was born in Buenos Aires. 
Prosperous but not rich, his family was respected in Latin 
American history, and included several famous military 
heroes. He did not attend school till he was nine, but he 
was taught at home by a British tutor. His father, who 
practiced law, encouraged him to read a lot. In 1921, he 
began publishing poems and essays. He got his first job 
as an assistant librarian in 1937, because he had to 
support his family after his father’s death. Over the next 
15 years he published most of the stories that would win 
international fame―collected in four volumes. He never 
attempted a novel, because his genius was best expressed 
through the shorter forms of literature.
① 부유하지는 않았지만 명망이 있는 가문에서 태어났다.
② 9세까지 집에서 영국인 개인 교사에게 교육받았다.
③ 1921년부터 자신의 작품을 세상에 발표하기 시작했다.
④ 가족 부양 때문에 보조 사서로 일한 경험이 있다.
⑤ 대부분의 장편 소설은 국제적인 명성을 얻었다.

38. The high level of euro-skepticism in Greece has brought 
a number of misunderstandings. It is commonly thought 
that the launch of the euro, Europe’s single currency, 
brought about an increase in the cost of living and this 
has affected the public’s overall opinion toward the 
European Union. The rise in prices is unquestionable but it 
is wrong to blame it on the introduction of the common 
currency. This is, firstly, because inflation existed before 
the euro and, secondly, because one cannot say where 
prices would stand today if the drachma was still in 
circulation. Therefore, high prices must be attributed to 
market distortions. The real problem is not the euro 
currency but the profiteers who are left unchecked.
* drachma: 그리스의 화폐 명칭

① 유럽연합 가입으로 그리스 경제가 활성화되었다.
② 그리스의 복잡한 시장 구조는 오랜 전통을 가지고 있다.
③ 그리스의 물가 상승은 유로화 도입보다는 시장 왜곡 때문이다.
④ 물가 안정을 위해 유럽국가의 새로운 경제 협의체가 필요하다.
⑤ 그리스 화폐의 사용이 국가 경제를 안정시키고 있다.
39. Most people believe that intelligence plays the key role 
in children’s academic achievement. A recent study, 
however, found that the ability to self-regulate― to pay 
attention to a task and control impulsive behavior―was 
more important than intelligence for early academic 
success. Clancy Blair, who led the study, said that children 
need to be provided with self-regulating activities to 
decrease impulsiveness and instant satisfaction and to 
promote attention and awareness of their own and other’s 
thoughts and feelings. Parents are advised to engage their 
children in activities that involve taking turns, paying 
attention for sustained periods, and giving incentives for 
thoughtful responses.
* impulsive: 충동적인
① 아동 교육에는 즉각적 통제와 보상이 중요하다.
② 장애 아동을 위한 특별한 학습 활동이 개발되어야 한다.
③ 아동의 학업 성취를 위해 자기 조절 능력 향상 활동이 필요하다.
④ 아동의 학습 능력 향상을 위한 학부모 교육프로그램이 절실하다.
⑤ 지능은 아동의 초기 학습 능력에 핵심적 요소이다.

However, that was too much for the young system to 
absorb, and the computer crashed, killing the connection 
after all. 
In 1969, Charley Kline was working as a programmer 
at UCLA and participating in a project at Stanford 
University. ( ① ) He was asked to arrange the first 
computer-to-computer message through an ordinary 
telephone line. ( ② ) After successfully connecting the 
two computers, Kline began to type login. ( ③ ) He 
typed l and got the echo from Stanford confirming that the 
letter had been received. ( ④ ) He proceeded with o and 
again received the appropriate echo. Then he ventured to g.
( ⑤ ) The connection was quickly reestablished, and after 
the UCLA and Stanford nodes were firmly in place, many 
others joined in.

41. We offer lengthy scientific explanations as answers to 
children’s questions, when a direct experience of something 
similar or an image that can live and work in their 
imagination would be much more satisfying to them. 
Rational explanations are like giving a hungry child stones 
instead of bread. A well-known early childhood educator 
points out that when young children ask questions like 
“Why does the sun shine?”, they are really asking about 
purpose rather than mechanics. They are much more 
nourished by an answer like “To keep us warm and to 
make the grass and the flowers grow” than a lecture on 
the relationship between heat and other forms of energy.

42. The air just above a glass contains molecules that are 
layered like a cake. At the top are the lightest scents of 
flowers, then the fruity ones, then the mineral and earthy 
smells; and finally, at the bottom the heaviest scent 
elements, wood and alcohol. A good glass does not allow 
these elements to be mixed up in a disorderly way. 
Golf-ball-size cups are just too small to concentrate the 
wine’s scents. They are like seats too close to the orchestra: 
all you hear are isolated sounds from the instruments, rather 
than the harmony that comes together farther back. The 
glass doesn’t change the wine itself, but rather the way we 
smell and taste it. Some glasses are like loudspeakers: their 
shape and volume increase a wine’s natural qualities.
① Various Flavors of Wine
② The Right Glass for Wine
③ Tips for Buying Good Wine
④ The Effect of Wine on Health
⑤ Glasses as a Musical Instrument
43. 다음 글의 분위기로 가장 적절한 것은?
The wail of farm machinery had fallen silent, and in 
the space it left I could hear the low gossip of hens, the 
lower throat singing of turkeys, and the varied sounds of 
birds in the trees. Up on the green, green shoulder of 
hill rising to the west I could see a small group of cattle 
grazing, and, below them on a gentler slope, several 
dozen chickens wandering down to the meadow. Laid 
before me was, I realized, a scene of almost classical 
rural beauty― the meadows dotted with contented animals, 
the woods in the background, a twisting stream threading 
through it all―spoiled only by the fact that I couldn’t

One of the most painful signs of the lack of 
readiness for the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004 
was the enthusiasm of children, who rushed excitedly 
down to the beach to gather fish during the initial 
retreat of water. 
(A) After the 19th century disaster, experts called for a 
tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean similar 
to the successful one now operating in the Pacific.
(B) If such a system had been up and running in the 
Indian Ocean, many of the thousands of lives lost in 
places relatively distant from the center of the 
earthquake might have been saved. 
(C) Those ill-fated children had no idea what the sea’s 
strange retreat meant. No one knew because nothing 
like that had happened in living memory except for 
the 1883 tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean.

Charles Wilson was asked how his experience as 
president of a large company could apply to the 
presidents of small companies. Wilson answered that 
when he was just a boy he worked for a dairy filling 
milk bottles. The bottles were all different sizes. 
Working in the dairy he learned that no matter what  
size the bottle was, the cream, the best part of milk, 
always came to the top. You can learn the same 
lesson. It doesn’t matter what size company you work 
for; you can always be the cream. To become the 
cream, continue to learn throughout your life, be open 
to new ideas and be aware of what is going on in the 
world which will affect you. You will rise to the top.

(A)
I no longer saw (a) the big figure in the same light. 
Instead of the dull boy who I had hated for a long time, 
here was someone like me, the human being who had 
internal value and worth far beyond any externals. It was 
amazing what I had learned from being forced to run 
hand-in-hand with someone. For the rest of my life I 
have never raised a hand against (b) another person.
(B)
At some point during the course of the obligatory 
mini-marathon that both of us felt anger about, I 
remember looking over at (c) the large person beside me. 
His nose was still bleeding a bit. Tears filled his eyes. 
His giant body slowed him down. Suddenly it struck me 
that here was a person, not all that different from myself. 
I guess (d) my unwilling partner thought the same thing 
because we both looked at each other and began to 
laugh. In time, we became good friends.
(C)
The gym teacher walked into the room, and recognized 
that I had been fighting with Matt. He sent us out to the 
running track. He followed us with a smile on his face 
and said, “I want both of you to run the track holding 
each other’s hands.” The class captain erupted into a roar 
of laughter, and we were embarrassed beyond belief. 
Hesitantly, (e) my enemy and I started running. What had 
earlier been fists were now linked in a strange 
handshake.

(A)
If you don’t have time to walk your child to school 
every day, maybe your child could join a walking bus. 
This is a set-up by which a group of children are walked 
to school by adult volunteers along a set route. Like a 
normal bus, the walking bus follows a timetable, so 
children can be picked up at scheduled times along the 
way. The volunteers take turns supervising the “bus.” 
This is attractive because the car stays at home, which 
reduces __________ outside the school. Also, children 
are getting exercise in the morning and it’s said that if 
children exercise before class their brains are more ready 
to learn.
(B)
It is better if children can visit their friends in the 
village by themselves. Otherwise, you have to walk or 
drive to drop them off and pick them up, wasting 
valuable time. We do have to drive them to activities and 
classes though. For example, my daughter, Katie, has a 
dance class and my son, Peter, has football, both in 
neighboring villages. What I try to do is to arrange rides 
for my kids with other parents. However, I think some 
people are a bit shy about saying, “I could take them 
this week, if you could do it next week,” but I don’t 
mind asking and people are pleased when I do. It’s not 
just that it saves fuel, time, and money, but it helps to 
decrease the amount of __________ in the villages, 
which is also good for the environment.
