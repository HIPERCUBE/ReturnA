37. Jorge Luis Borges에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Jorge Luis Borges, the most influential short-story 
writer in Latin America, was born in Buenos Aires. 
Prosperous but not rich, his family was respected in Latin 
American history, and included several famous military 
heroes. He did not attend school till he was nine, but he 
was taught at home by a British tutor. His father, who 
practiced law, encouraged him to read a lot. In 1921, he 
began publishing poems and essays. He got his first job 
as an assistant librarian in 1937, because he had to 
support his family after his father’s death. Over the next 
15 years he published most of the stories that would win 
international fame―collected in four volumes. He never 
attempted a novel, because his genius was best expressed 
through the shorter forms of literature.
