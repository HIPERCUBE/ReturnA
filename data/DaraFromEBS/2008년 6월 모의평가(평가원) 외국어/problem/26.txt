26. I enjoy shopping at FW Whole Foods nearly as much as 
I enjoy browsing a good bookstore. It’s the inspiring 
expressions that elevate the food into a more exciting 
experience, one with artistic, emotional, and even political 
dimensions. On a recent visit I filled my shopping cart 
with eggs “from cage-free vegetarian hens,” milk from 
cows that live “free from unnecessary fear,” and tomatoes 
from HSR Farm, “one of the early pioneers of the organic 
movement.” In this regard, shopping at FW Whole Foods 
is a _______________. Indeed, every time I shop in FW 
Whole Foods, I think that this is a place where the skills 
of a literary critic might come in handy―perhaps also a 
journalist’s.
