Welcome and thank you for joining the dining club. 
Our club offers a unique dining experience. You will be 
trying food from all over the world, but more importantly, 
you will have the chance to experience each country’s 
dining traditions and customs. In India, for example, they 
use their hands to eat. If you are used to using forks and 
knives, you may find this challenging. In France, dinners 
have many courses, so make sure to schedule enough 
time for the French meal. In Japan, they don’t eat their 
soup with a spoon, so you have to drink directly from 
the bowl. These are some of the things you will 
experience every Saturday evening until the end of 
August. We hope you will enjoy your dining adventure.
