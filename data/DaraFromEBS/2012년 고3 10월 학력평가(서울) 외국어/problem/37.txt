37. Mordecai Brown에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
There was an amazing pitcher whose name was Mordecai 
Brown. He was born in Nyesville, Indiana, in 1876. From the 
time he arrived in the big leagues with St. Louis, he was 
known as Three Finger Brown. Mordecai only had three 
fingers on his right hand, his pitching hand. That was the 
result of a farming accident when he was a youngster. But 
Mordecai gripped the ball the only way he could with his 
thumb and two remaining fingers. The result was a strange 
hop on the ball, one he probably couldn’t have achieved if his 
hand had not been injured. He played with five major league 
baseball clubs, and was famous for his exceptional curveball, 
which broke radically before reaching the plate. Mordecai 
Brown was eventually elected to baseball’s Hall of Fame in 
1949, one year after he died.
