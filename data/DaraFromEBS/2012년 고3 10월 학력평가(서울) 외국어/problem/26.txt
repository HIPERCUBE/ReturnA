26. In a study, researchers observed a small industrial 
community in Austria called Marienthal at a time when the 
entire community was out of work. They noted that before 
the economic depression, people in the community were 
active in leisure as well as work. They participated in 
political organizations, frequented the public library, and 
enjoyed organizing various social events. After the town 
factory closed and everyone was out of work, the citizens 
showed no concern. The citizens, cut off from their work, 
lost the material and moral incentives to make use of their 
time. Marienthal’s citizens not only lost their work, but they 
lost their   . Clearly, they had no free time 
because they had no constrained time. The researchers 
summed up the problem this way: “The trouble with 
unemployment is that you never get a day off.”
