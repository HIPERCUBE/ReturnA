24. Reading seems to be an important activity that helps 
teenagers secure a good   . Some researchers 
from Oxford University studied 17,000 people all born in the 
same week in May, 1970. They are now grown up and in 
their early 40s and the sociological study has tracked their 
progress through time. At the age of 16, in 1986, they were 
asked which activities they did in their spare time for 
pleasure. These answers were then checked against what they 
were engaged in at the age of 33, in 2003. The researchers 
found that there was a 39 percent probability that girls would 
be in professional or managerial posts at 33 if they had read 
books at 16, but only a 25 percent chance if they had not. 
For boys the figures rose from 48 percent to 58 percent if 
they read books.
