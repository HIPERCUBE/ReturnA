22. Every student in your school gets 168 hours each week. 
Subtract the time kids spend on sleeping, eating, and 
associating with friends and family, and so on (about 84 
hours). That leaves each child with about 84 hours each week, 
or 4,368 hours each year. Out of that block, you as a teacher 
get at most 30 hours each week, or 1,260 hours each year for 
changing student lives. Then, you have 28 percent of a 
student’s waking time. The significance of that number, 28 
percent, is profound. With the small proportion of their lives 
that you do have access to, you cannot afford to waste a 
single class or school day. You cannot afford to bore a student 
or fail to engage her in class. School needs to be a nonstop 
bobsled run, full of activity, challenge, correction, support, and 
enrichment. You need to challenge students to do their best 
every hour of every day they are in your charge.
