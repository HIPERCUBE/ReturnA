One summer, I was traveling with a small group in Greece. 
Included in our group was an 85‑year‑old lady. I called her 
“Sweetie.” She was frail, tiny, and thin but ① she was such 
a brave traveler and didn’t want to miss a thing. So, 
although she was very tired, ② she insisted on going along 
to the Euripides Theater to see a Greek play. No sooner 
had the play begun than ③ she started to doze off, falling 
forward. There were no backs on these seats. Before I 
could help ④ her, a local Greek peasant woman reached 
forward and took hold of the tiny narrow shoulders of 
Sweetie. The woman slowly drew the tired body back until 
it leaned against ⑤ her knees. She provided support for 
Sweetie for the entire play.
