Goldcorp was a small gold‑mining firm, based in Toronto. 
Facing higher costs of production, accumulating debt, and few 
prospects of finding new gold deposits, the company was on 
the brink of bankruptcy when its CEO, Robert McEwen, got a 
radical idea. He would take all of the company’s geological 
data on its Red Lake property, put it up on the Web, and 
ask the world to tell the company             . The 
company offered $575,000 in prize money. Over one 
thousand cyberspace prospectors from fifty countries began 
analyzing the data. Geologists weighed in, as did 
mathematicians, military personnel, and graduate students 
from diverse fields.
What was so interesting was the range of expertise from 
so many different disciplines including advanced physics, 
applied math, and intelligent systems. The results were 
startling. “There were capabilities I had never seen before in 
the industry,” noted McEwen. “When I saw the computer 
graphics I almost fell out of my chair.” The contestants had 
pinpointed 110 locations on the company’s property, half of 
which had never been earmarked by company geologists. 
Amazingly, more than eighty percent of the new targets 
yielded large amounts of gold — more than eight million 
ounces.
