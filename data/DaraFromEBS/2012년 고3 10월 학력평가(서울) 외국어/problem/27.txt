27.     . Igor Stravinsky wrote the score 
for his ballet Apollo Musagetes in six parts for a string 
orchestra. The first time it was performed, there were 
sixteen first and fourteen second violins, ten violas, four first 
and four second cellos, and six double basses. Stravinsky was 
horrified: “I was struck by both the confusion of sound and 
the excessive resonance.... Everything seemed drowned in 
indistinct buzzing.” He pared the orchestra down to eight first 
and eight second violins, six violas, four first and four second 
cellos, and four double basses, and “everything became sharp 
and clear.” As Stravinsky found out the hard way, scaling is a 
major issue in orchestrating music.

③　Music is recreated by the audience
④　Good music has to be listened to loud
⑤　Composers should do more than entertain audience
