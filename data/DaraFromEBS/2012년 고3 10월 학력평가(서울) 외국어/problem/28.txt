28. What’s interesting about animals being afraid is that  
. A fearful prey animal like a deer 
ought to just get out of there whenever it sees something 
strange and different that it doesn’t understand. But that’s not 
what happens. The more fearful the animal, the more likely 
he is to investigate. Indians used this principle to hunt 
antelope. They’d lie down on the ground holding a flag, and 
when the antelope came up to investigate they’d kill it. I’ve 
never heard of Indians lying down on the ground holding a 
flag to catch buffalo. I don’t think a buffalo is going to be as 
compelled to investigate a flag flying in the middle of the 
prairie. He’s a great big strong buffalo; what does he have to 
worry about? But a delicate little antelope has a lot to worry 
about, and that’s why he’s always looking into things.
