23. A man standing on the street corner selling “nonbreakable” 
pens suddenly finds that the one he is demonstrating with 
breaks in half. He stops for a moment, turns to the crowd, 
and declares, “Now I’ll show you what the inside looks 
like.” Laughter can turn any disadvantage into an advantage. 
People who know this not only look for some positive aspect 
in their misfortunes but actually go one step further. After 
their initial shock, they gather their resources, overcome their 
problem, and see opportunities where most of us fail to see 
them. Moreover, many who have experienced a major loss 
often go on to achieve remarkable feats in spite of their 
hardships, because they focus on what they can gain from 
their circumstance rather than on what they have lost. They 
believe in the old cliché that every cloud has a silver lining, 
and they actively seek the advantage in their disadvantage.
