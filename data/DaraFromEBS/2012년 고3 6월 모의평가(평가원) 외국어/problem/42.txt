42. Several plane crashes and near crashes have been attributed 
to dangerous downward wind bursts known as wind shear. 
These wind bursts generally result from high-speed downdrafts 
in the turbulence of thunderstorms, but they can occur in 
clear air when rain evaporates high above the ground. ①The 
downdraft spreads out when it hits the ground and forms an 
inward circular pattern. ② A plane entering the pattern 
experiences an unexpected upward headwind that lifts the 
plane. ③ Special radar systems are being installed at major 
airports to detect the location of unpredictable thunderstorms. 
④ To resist it, the pilot often cuts speed and lowers the 
plane’s nose to compensate. ⑤ Further into the circular 
pattern, the wind quickly turns downward, and an airplane 
can suddenly lose altitude and possibly crash when it is near 
the ground, as upon landing.
