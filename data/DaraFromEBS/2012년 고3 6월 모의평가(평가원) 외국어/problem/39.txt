39. The streets of New York are home to numerous trucks, 
vans, stands, and pushcarts all selling food. Most of the 
vendors are immigrants bringing street versions of the 
world’s diverse food traditions to this already international 
metropolis. You can snack on Jamaican goat patties, sample 
Chinese noodles, take a bite of Egyptian falafel, or enjoy 
vegetarian Sri Lankan curry. New York even has an annual 
award ceremony, the Vendy Awards, for the best sidewalk 
chefs. Part of the fun is tracking down the best offerings. 
Trucks and vans often visit different areas of New York on 
different days; some chefs operate only at certain times of 
day or only on weekends. Even stands with regular spots and 
hours occasionally vanish, as the owner finds a better spot 
or takes a week off. Follow the crowds, or ask locals for 
information ― hotel doormen will often let you into the 
secrets of a neighborhood’s best vendors.
