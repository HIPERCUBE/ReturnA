This graph shows the number of U.S. Science and 
Engineering (S & E) doctoral degrees earned by students 
from China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan from 1987 to 
2007. ① In 1987, Taiwan had the largest number of S & E 
doctoral degree recipients from U.S. institutions while China 
had the least. ② However, China quickly caught up to the 
other countries by 1990, and has since produced the most 
U.S. S & E doctoral degree recipients of the four Asian 
countries. ③ Between 2001 and 2005, more U.S. S & E 
doctorates were given to South Korean students than to their 
Indian peers. ④ What is noticeable is that since the early 
1990s, all four countries have consistently showed a steady 
increase in the number of U.S. S & E doctoral degree 
recipients. ⑤ From 1987 to 2007, none of the four Asian 
countries broke the barrier of receiving 5,000 U.S. S & E 
doctorates in a single year, but China came closest when it 
received 4,500 in 2007.
