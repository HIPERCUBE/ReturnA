If you’ve ever gone snorkeling, you may ① have seen an 
amazing sight: an entire school of fish suddenly changes 
direction as one unit. The same goes for flocks of birds. So 
are they all following the commands of a leader? Researchers 
have determined that there is no leader or controlling force. 
Rather, the individual fish or bird is reacting ② almost 
instantly to the movements of its neighbors in the school or 
flock. ③ Any individual can initiate a movement, such as a 
change in direction, and this sends out a “maneuver wave,” 
which spreads through the group at an astounding speed. 
Because individuals can see, or sense, the wave ④ coming 
toward them, they are ready to react more quickly than they 
would without such advance notice. ⑤ That appears to us as 
simultaneous is actually a kind of “follow your neighbor” 
behavior moving faster than the eye can see.
