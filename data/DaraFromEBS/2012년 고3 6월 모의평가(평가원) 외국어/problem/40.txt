40. Fourteenth-century approaches to music had a profound 
and continuing impact on music in later centuries. Perhaps 
most significant was the invention of a precise and 
unambiguous notation that could record a wide variety of 
rhythms and allowed music to be distributed in writing and 
performed accurately wherever it went. We now take this 
for granted when we play from notation and sight-read through 
unfamiliar music, but it was a remarkable innovation in the 
fourteenth century. Among its effects was that composers 
could fix their music exactly as they wished it to be 
performed, leading them to take pride in authorship. The 
increased interest in the individual and in satisfying the 
human senses that was characteristic of the age grew 
stronger in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and has 
remained important ever since.
