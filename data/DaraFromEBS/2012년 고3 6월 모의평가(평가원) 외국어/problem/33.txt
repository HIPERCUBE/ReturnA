33. What everyday rules for behavior guide parents’ efforts 
to socialize their toddlers and preschool-age children? To 
answer this question, Gralinski and Kopp observed and 
interviewed mothers and their children in these age groups. 
They found that for fifteen-month-olds, mothers’ rules and 
requests centered on ensuring the children’s safety and, to a 
lesser extent, protecting the families’ possessions from harm; 
respecting basic social niceties (“Don’t bite”; “No kicking”); 
and learning to delay getting what they wanted. As children’s 
ages and cognitive sophistication increased, the numbers and 
kinds of prohibitions and requests expanded from the original 
focus on child protection and interpersonal issues to family 
routines, self-care, and other concerns regarding the child’s 
independence. By the time children were three, a new quality 
of rule emerged: “Do not scream in a restaurant, run around 
naked in front of company, or pick your nose.”
