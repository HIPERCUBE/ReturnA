27. Lifeline infrastructures are vital systems that support a 
nation’s economy and quality of life. Modern economies 
rely on the ability to move goods, people, and information 
safely and reliably. Adding to their importance is that 
many of the lifeline systems serve vital roles in disaster 
recovery. Consequently, it is of the utmost importance to 
government, business, and the public at large that the 
flow of services provided by a nation’s infrastructure 
continues unimpeded in the face of a broad range of 
natural and technological hazards. The linkage between 
systems and services is critical to any discussion of 
infrastructure. Although it is the performance of the 
hardware (i.e., the highways, pipes, and transmission lines) 
that is of immediate concern following an earthquake, it 
is actually the loss of services that these systems provide 
that is the real loss to the public. Therefore, a high 
priority in protecting these systems from hazards is 
ensuring ___________________________________.

② the durability and stability of transmission lines
③ the continuity, or at least the rapid restoration, of service
④ a prompt mobilization of experts for disaster control
