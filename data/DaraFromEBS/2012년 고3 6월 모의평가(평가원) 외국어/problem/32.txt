Organic food production is growing by leaps and bounds. 
Many consumers are willing to pay premium prices for organic 
foods, convinced that they are helping the earth and eating 
healthier. Some experts say, however, that organic farming has 
some ① drawbacks. One of the most frequent criticisms is 
that the crop yields of organic farms are much ② lower than 
those of traditional farms. That’s because organic fields suffer 
more from weeds and insects than ③ conventional fields. 
Another argument often offered by experts is that organic 
farming can supply food for niche markets of ④ wealthy 
consumers but cannot feed billions of hungry people around 
the globe. Only the careful use of chemical inputs, not the 
costly organic methods, can help ⑤ reduce food production 
significantly in the countries facing hunger.
