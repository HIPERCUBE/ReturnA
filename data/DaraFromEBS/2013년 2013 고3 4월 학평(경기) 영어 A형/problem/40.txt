It is not that difficult to make an ant farm. You need a large
glass jar, a soda can, a sponge, some dirt, ants, fabric, and black
paper. Place the soda can in the center of the jar as a first step.
(A) You can slide the paper off to observe the ants. It may
take a while before you see tunnels. Don’t forget to feed
the ants some crumbs every few days!
(B) Fill the space between the can and the jar with lightly
packed dirt, and put a piece of moist sponge on top of the
can. Keep the sponge moist by pouring a little water on it
from time to time.
(C) Then, put the ants on the dirt. Cover the top of the jar
with fabric and secure it tightly with a rubber band so the
ants can’t escape. Wrap the black paper around the jar and
tape them together.
