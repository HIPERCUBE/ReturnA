When you organize a party, a seminar, a family party, or
whatever, make sure you don’t just get the people who already
know each other clustering together. If you invite people to a
meal, you can use place cards to facilitate successful networking.
Organize games so that people sitting at each table can mix.
When you announce, “The buffet is open,” address the subject
openly by saying, “Take this opportunity to get to know new
people.” A lot of people find this an effective icebreaker to be
able to start speaking to others. Don’t be afraid of issuing name
badges at large gatherings if people don’t know each other. Get
each person to write something typical but a bit mysterious on
the badge. That is a nice way of making it possible for people
to start a conversation with people they don’t know.
