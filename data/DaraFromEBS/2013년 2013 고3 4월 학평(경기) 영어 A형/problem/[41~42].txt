Many people say mentors were important to their success.
While mentors provide a support role, there’s another group
of people who don’t really support you― they push you, and
not in a nice way. I call them tor-mentors since they give
you a kick in the butt rather than a pat on the back.
Tor-mentors are people who bully you, ridicule you, or
put you down. You can let them destroy you or you can use
them as a powerful force that actually pushes you to beat
them, prove them wrong, or prove yourself. And sometimes
that pushes you further than you ever thought you could go.
Basketball superstar Michael Jordan was a first-class
tor-mentor himself. He said he did it to push his
teammates to perform better on the basketball court: “If you
don’t bring your level up to compete with me then I’m going
to completely dominate you, and I’m going to talk trash to
you and about you while I’m dominating. That’s my way of
getting my teammates to their game.” And
Michael’s tormenting helped push his team to the top.
