23. 다음글에서필자가주장하는바로가장적절한것은?
So many problems can be avoided by slowing down and
carefully considering how to proceed in any given situation. In
some instances, of course, there isn’t time to slow down and we
have to just react. But generally we have more time than we allot
ourselves to make decisions and draw conclusions. Slowing down
provides time to consider how an issue has been framed and
whether we have really considered all the relevant factors. We
ought to pause for a moment in order to reconsider actions that
could have serious consequences. Putting on the mental brakes
can stop you, for example, from reacting in anger to someone on
the road ―a situation that can lead to danger. If more of us
would take just a couple extra moments to think an action
through, we would all be much better off.
① 타인의충고에귀를기울여라.
② 한번에한가지일에만집중하라.
③ 현재의주어진상황에서최선을다하라.
④ 역경에굴복하지말고도약의기회로삼아라.
⑤ 행동하기전에여유를갖고생각할시간을가져라.
24. 다음글의목적으로가장적절한것은?
Dear Mr. Wells,
Our family has shopped at your supermarket for
several years. While the staff has always been friendly
and helpful, one of your employees is particularly
outstanding, and I want to tell you how wonderful I
think he is. Freddy, who bags groceries and brings
them out to the car, frequently goes out of his way to
help. Yesterday he finished loading my car and headed
back to the store. I tried to pull out but found myself
stuck in the snow. When he heard my wheels spinning,
Freddy came back and gave me a push. It’s nice to find
someone these days who’s willing to go that extra mile
to please a customer. You ought to know that he is a
terrific employee. That thoughtful young man will be
very successful someday.
Yours truly,
Judy Green

25. 다음글의요지로가장적절한것은?
Studies have revealed that, in general, the people who get
hired are those who mix speaking and listening fifty-fifty in
the interview. That is, half the time they let the employer do
the talking, half the time they do the talking. People who didn’t
follow that mix were the ones who didn’t get hired, according
to the studies. I think that if you talk too much about yourself,
you may seem like a person who would ignore the needs of the
organization; if you talk too little, you may seem like a person
trying to hide something about your background. So during the
interview, be determined to observe the fifty-fifty rule.
① 면접관의질문에창의적으로답변을해야한다.
② 합의에의해도출된조직의결정은존중되어야한다.
③ 구직자는사회변화에맞추어취업준비를해야한다.
④ 구직면접시말하기와듣기의비율을같게해야한다.
⑤ 업무효율을높이려면의사결정과정이단순해야한다.
26. 다음글의주제로가장적절한것은?
When you organize a party, a seminar, a family party, or
whatever, make sure you don’t just get the people who already
know each other clustering together. If you invite people to a
meal, you can use place cards to facilitate successful networking.
Organize games so that people sitting at each table can mix.
When you announce, “The buffet is open,” address the subject
openly by saying, “Take this opportunity to get to know new
people.” A lot of people find this an effective icebreaker to be
able to start speaking to others. Don’t be afraid of issuing name
badges at large gatherings if people don’t know each other. Get
each person to write something typical but a bit mysterious on
the badge. That is a nice way of making it possible for people
to start a conversation with people they don’t know.
