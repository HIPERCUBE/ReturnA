23. 다음글에서필자가주장하는바로가장적절한것은?
So many problems can be avoided by slowing down and
carefully considering how to proceed in any given situation. In
some instances, of course, there isn’t time to slow down and we
have to just react. But generally we have more time than we allot
ourselves to make decisions and draw conclusions. Slowing down
provides time to consider how an issue has been framed and
whether we have really considered all the relevant factors. We
ought to pause for a moment in order to reconsider actions that
could have serious consequences. Putting on the mental brakes
can stop you, for example, from reacting in anger to someone on
the road ―a situation that can lead to danger. If more of us
would take just a couple extra moments to think an action
through, we would all be much better off.
① 타인의충고에귀를기울여라.
② 한번에한가지일에만집중하라.
③ 현재의주어진상황에서최선을다하라.
④ 역경에굴복하지말고도약의기회로삼아라.
⑤ 행동하기전에여유를갖고생각할시간을가져라.
24. 다음글의목적으로가장적절한것은?
Dear Mr. Wells,
Our family has shopped at your supermarket for
several years. While the staff has always been friendly
and helpful, one of your employees is particularly
outstanding, and I want to tell you how wonderful I
think he is. Freddy, who bags groceries and brings
them out to the car, frequently goes out of his way to
help. Yesterday he finished loading my car and headed
back to the store. I tried to pull out but found myself
stuck in the snow. When he heard my wheels spinning,
Freddy came back and gave me a push. It’s nice to find
someone these days who’s willing to go that extra mile
to please a customer. You ought to know that he is a
terrific employee. That thoughtful young man will be
very successful someday.
Yours truly,
Judy Green

25. 다음글의요지로가장적절한것은?
Studies have revealed that, in general, the people who get
hired are those who mix speaking and listening fifty-fifty in
the interview. That is, half the time they let the employer do
the talking, half the time they do the talking. People who didn’t
follow that mix were the ones who didn’t get hired, according
to the studies. I think that if you talk too much about yourself,
you may seem like a person who would ignore the needs of the
organization; if you talk too little, you may seem like a person
trying to hide something about your background. So during the
interview, be determined to observe the fifty-fifty rule.

26. 다음글의주제로가장적절한것은?
When you organize a party, a seminar, a family party, or
whatever, make sure you don’t just get the people who already
know each other clustering together. If you invite people to a
meal, you can use place cards to facilitate successful networking.
Organize games so that people sitting at each table can mix.
When you announce, “The buffet is open,” address the subject
openly by saying, “Take this opportunity to get to know new
people.” A lot of people find this an effective icebreaker to be
able to start speaking to others. Don’t be afraid of issuing name
badges at large gatherings if people don’t know each other. Get
each person to write something typical but a bit mysterious on
the badge. That is a nice way of making it possible for people
to start a conversation with people they don’t know.

31. (A)~ (C)에서어법에맞는표현을바르게짝지은것은? [3점]
One of the greatest ways to cultivate a possibility mind-set
(A) is / are to prompt yourself to dream one size bigger than
you normally do. Let’s face it: Most people dream too small.
They don’t think big enough. Henry Curtis advises, “Make
your plans as fantastic as you like (B) because / because of
twenty-five years from now, they will not seem so special.
Make your plans ten times as great as you first planned, and
twenty-five years from now you will wonder why you did
not make them fifty times as great.” If you push yourself to
dream more expansively and to make your goals at least a
step beyond what makes you (C) comfortable / comfortably ,
you will be forced to grow. And it will set you up to believe
in greater possibilities.
(A) (B) (C)
① is …… because …… comfortable
② is …… because of …… comfortably
③ is …… because …… comfortably
④ are …… because …… comfortable
⑤ are …… because of …… comfortably
32. 다음글에 드러난 Violet의 심경으로 가장적절한 것은?
Violet sat back, looked out the window, and watched the wind
softly blow the trees as she nodded off. She awoke to the
sound of a faint but promising whisper from the hospital bed.
She looked at Joseph and saw his lips move ever so slightly.
Violet knew what she had seen and gasped in delight. “Joseph?”
she dared to breathe his name expectantly. Again she heard a
sound and saw his lips move. Violet jumped to her feet. “I hear
you, Joseph! I hear you! Do it again! I hear you! Do it again! I
know you can do it!” By now she had lowered the rail on his
bed and was leaning over so she could see his lips and hear his
voice. The sound came louder and stronger.
① calm
② bored
③ hopeful
④ horrified
⑤ depressed
[33~35] 다음 글의빈칸에 들어갈말로가장 적절한것을고르시오.
33. A ratio is a way of expressing the relationship between
one number and another. If there is one teacher to fifty
students, the teacher/student ratio is one to fifty, and the
student/teacher ratio is fifty to one. If a very wealthy prince
were being tutored by fifty teachers, the teacher/student
ratio would be fifty to one, and the student/teacher ratio
would be one to fifty. As you can see, the in
which the numbers are compared is important. That is, if the
arrangement of the two items, teacher and student, changes,
the ratio of the items will change, too.
① time ② order ③ speed
④ height ⑤ movement
34. Our health is certainly a matter of how we feel, but it is a lot
more besides. We must always factor in .
An individual may feel fine, but if significant others in his or
her community keep saying things like, “You don’t seem like
yourself,” or “Is there something wrong?” that person may feel
impelled to go to the doctor to get checked out. The doctor, in
turn, may perform various tests that indicate that there is,
indeed, something wrong even if the person is as yet
experiencing no overt symptoms. Once the doctor has
confirmed one’s friends’ evaluation that something is wrong,
the person is very likely to start feeling a lot less lively. [3점]
① what the people around us think
② how doctors react to our thoughts
③ the clear symptoms we often have
④ results of regular medical checkups
⑤ when others feel they are unhealthy
35. Many of us spend time finding faults in the people we deal
with in our lives. If, instead, we try to search their character for
what we like about them, we’ll like them more; and, as a result,
they’ll like us more. My friend had a very difficult relationship
with her boss. Worse still, she truly disliked him as a person.
One day, however, she decided to .
Even though her manager was not a kind person in the office, he
was a very devoted family man. After focusing on this quality, a
little at a time, she started to like him gradually. One day, she
told him honestly that she admired how family-oriented he was.
Surprisingly the next day, he was in her office, giving her some
information that was very useful to her. [3점]
① acknowledge his strengths
② convince him to work harder
③ point out his wrong behaviors
④ force him to endure the conditions
⑤ make a complaint about her company
36. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은
것은? [3점]
Pay is most carefully considered when a person is applying
for a job and considering an offer. In general, people ① accept
offers where the monetary compensation is near the amount
that they were hoping for. Over time, employees often expect
to receive raises and/or bonuses, but these factors are not just
about ②money. Employees want to be compensated fairly for
their work. If they are taking on a heavier workload with more
difficult projects, it is likely they would expect ③ inadequate
compensation for their efforts. Part of this compensation could
be monetary, but often times ④recognition is just as important.
People love to hear they have done a good job. A ⑤promotion
that includes a title change can be just as meaningful, if not
more meaningful than an increase in salary.
37. 다음글의 (A), (B)에 들어갈말로 가장적절한 것은?
Most people who work are used to setting and pursuing
performance goals. Most workers will give you a blank stare if
you ask what their learning goals are, or they will offer up a
performance goal in disguise. (A) , “I would like to
learn to make more money,” and “I would like to learn to break
eighty in golf,” are simply performance goals with the word
learning inserted. How does a learning goal differ from a
performance goal? Performance is something you do that
brings about an observable change in the external world.
Learning, (B) , is a change that takes place within
the learner, although often as a result of interaction with the
external world. Thus a change in understanding based on new
information or on a new interpretation of old information would
be classified as learning.
(A) (B)
① However …… in fact
② However …… as a result
③ Moreover …… instead
④ For example …… in the same way
⑤ For example …… on the other hand
38. 다음글에서 전체흐름과 관계없는 문장은?
A roof that is completely or partially covered with vegetation
and soil is known as a green roof. ① In urban areas, green roofs
provide wildlife habitat, even on the tops of tall buildings. ② A
city with multiple green roofs provides “stepping stones” of habitat
that enable migrating birds and insects to pass unharmed through
the city. ③Green roofs can also be used to grow vegetable and
fruit crops or to provide an outdoor refuge for people living or
working in the building. ④Moreover, it is difficult to grow
plants because heating costs in winter and cooling costs in
summer increase. ⑤ Green roofs allow urban systems to more
closely resemble the natural systems they have replaced.

[3점]
Regrettably, this is not the case ― not even for the fastest
sprinters in the world.
For most athletes, maximum speed is reached between
40-60m. Once this is achieved, the challenge is to hold this
speed for as long as possible. ( ① ) Young athletes may run with
the belief that they will run faster and faster until they reach the
finishing line. ( ② ) After 60m, all sprinters start to slow down.
( ③ ) At both maximum speed and decelerating speed, the
challenge for the runner is to maintain their technique as long
as possible. ( ④ ) Vigorous arm actions, powerful extensions
of the rear leg, and applying sprinting forces through the ball of the
foot will all help to hold the speed as long as possible. ( ⑤ )
Some people observe that great sprinters start to pull away from
other runners toward the finishing line―this is because these
athletes are not slowing down as fast as their opponents.

It is not that difficult to make an ant farm. You need a large
glass jar, a soda can, a sponge, some dirt, ants, fabric, and black
paper. Place the soda can in the center of the jar as a first step.
(A) You can slide the paper off to observe the ants. It may
take a while before you see tunnels. Don’t forget to feed
the ants some crumbs every few days!
(B) Fill the space between the can and the jar with lightly
packed dirt, and put a piece of moist sponge on top of the
can. Keep the sponge moist by pouring a little water on it
from time to time.
(C) Then, put the ants on the dirt. Cover the top of the jar
with fabric and secure it tightly with a rubber band so the
ants can’t escape. Wrap the black paper around the jar and
tape them together.

Many people say mentors were important to their success.
While mentors provide a support role, there’s another group
of people who don’t really support you― they push you, and
not in a nice way. I call them tor-mentors since they give
you a kick in the butt rather than a pat on the back.
Tor-mentors are people who bully you, ridicule you, or
put you down. You can let them destroy you or you can use
them as a powerful force that actually pushes you to beat
them, prove them wrong, or prove yourself. And sometimes
that pushes you further than you ever thought you could go.
Basketball superstar Michael Jordan was a first-class
tor-mentor himself. He said he did it to push his
teammates to perform better on the basketball court: “If you
don’t bring your level up to compete with me then I’m going
to completely dominate you, and I’m going to talk trash to
you and about you while I’m dominating. That’s my way of
getting my teammates to their game.” And
Michael’s tormenting helped push his team to the top.

(A)
The Memorial Day march came to an end. The old veteran’s
body ached from marching, and he began to look for a place
to rest his tired feet. He made his way to a park bench, sat
down, and lowered his head. A young boy passing by saw
(a) him, approached, and said, “Please sir, do you mind if I
ask you what the medals you wear are for? Did you get them
for being a war hero?”
(B)
The old veteran continued, “We wear the medals in their
honor, as a symbol of respect. All veterans wear them on
Memorial Day to show that we will not forget their
sacrifice.” The old veteran climbed to his feet and asked the
boy to stand up. Carefully, he removed the medals and placed
them in the boy’s small hand. (b) He told the boy that he
could keep them, and treasure them, throughout his life.
(C)
The veteran was startled, but he moved over and asked the
boy to sit down. Though he had not expected such an
invitation, the boy eagerly accepted it. “First of all, I was not
a hero,” said the old man. (c) His voice was low and serious.
“But I served with many heroes, ones who never returned
home. It’s important to understand that the real heroes were
the people who gave their lives defending this land.”
(D)
The boy was speechless. He could not speak and he could
hardly move. The old veteran went quietly on (d) his way
leaving the boy standing by the bench. In the distance, the
young boy saw the veteran turn and wave goodbye. He sat
down there alone, with tears welling in his eyes. He never
again saw him, but he always remembered the day (e) he
learned about heroes and received that special gift.
