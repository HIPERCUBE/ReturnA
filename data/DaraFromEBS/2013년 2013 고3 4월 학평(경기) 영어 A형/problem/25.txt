Studies have revealed that, in general, the people who get
hired are those who mix speaking and listening fifty-fifty in
the interview. That is, half the time they let the employer do
the talking, half the time they do the talking. People who didn’t
follow that mix were the ones who didn’t get hired, according
to the studies. I think that if you talk too much about yourself,
you may seem like a person who would ignore the needs of the
organization; if you talk too little, you may seem like a person
trying to hide something about your background. So during the
interview, be determined to observe the fifty-fifty rule.
