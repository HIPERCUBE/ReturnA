I had never been on a roller coaster. Today, I was faced 
with one. There was some kind of bar, which was raised in 
front of me and was brought back into my lap. My heart 
started to pound. Trying to put myself at ease, I held 
tightly onto the bar in my lap. The cars jumped a bit and 
we began moving along the track. Now, I could even hear 
heartbeats, louder than the “clickity­click” sound coming 
from under the cars. We moved from a horizontal position 
to a steep incline and the roller coaster began ascending to 
the top of that first hill. My heart pounded wildly! I could 
not look out over the side of the car. Even before the 
coaster began to fall down, I was in a total panic.
