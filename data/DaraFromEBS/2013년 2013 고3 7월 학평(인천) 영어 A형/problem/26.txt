With seven billion mouths to feed, human agriculture 
takes a tremendous toll on the planet, from energy use to 
habitat loss. But there is also a growing set of solutions, 
from organic agriculture to integrated pest control. More 
people around the world are taking a look at urban farming, 
which allows us to make our food as “local” as possible. By 
growing what we need near where we live, we decrease the 
“foodmiles” associated with long­distance transportation. 
Also, urban agriculture can add greenery to cities, reducing 
pollution, increasing shade, and preventing the unpleasant 
heat island effect. Garden plots can help people reconnect 
with the Earth, and gain a greater appreciation for where 
our food comes from. Rooftop and patio gardens create 
peaceful places for relaxation and they can attract tourists.
