35. Desserts are hard to resist. But the resistance is a little 
easier when their scent is intense. According to a recent 
study in the journal Flavour, when we experience a strong 
complementary aroma with our food, we take smaller bites. 
The scent of coffee in a mocha dessert can be a good 
example. It is thought that there is some sort of feedback 
loop happening in our brains: a strong complementary smell 
makes us                          　　　. Next time you 
serve a sweet treat at a dinner party, think about lighting a 
vanilla­scented candle. The scent of the candle may help 
your friends not overeat. Or when you order a dessert at a 
restaurant, pair it with strong­smelling coffee. You can find 
its flavor goes into effect.
