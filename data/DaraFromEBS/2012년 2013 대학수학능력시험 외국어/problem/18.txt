As you are well aware, a great tragedy took place in 
our city last week. Some faulty electrical wiring led to a 
fire breaking out and eventually destroying an entire 
block of homes in the suburbs. From the very  beginning 
it was fanned by strong winds, but it would not have 
spread so far and so quickly, if our firefighters had been 
able to arrive at the scene in time. Our city has only one   
fire station located downtown. Would you please establish 
a new fire station in our area, since you are mayor of 
our city? We are in urgent need of one. I look forward 
to your response.
