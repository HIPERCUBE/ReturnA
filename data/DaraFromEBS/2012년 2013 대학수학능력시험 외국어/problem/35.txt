35. Although praise may encourage children to continue an 
activity while an adult is watching, according to recent   
studies, they are less  likely to continue the activity when 
the adult leaves or to repeat the activity in the future. 
Rather than increasing children’s commitment to positive 
behavior, praise encourages children to find ways to get 
future verbal “goodies” from important adults. In other 
words, praise is like the large pink icing rose in the center 
of a cake. It is appealing and at first bite its sweetness 
tastes wonderful. A couple more bites still might taste 
good, but it quickly becomes overly sweet. It has only 
one simple flavor; we soon tire of it and if we eat very 
much at any one time, we might even feel slightly ill. It 
may provide some quick energy but it provides no 
nourishment and doesn’t support growth or health.
