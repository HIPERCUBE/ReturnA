“Why, in country after country that mandated seat 
belts, was it impossible to see the promised reduction in 
road accident fatalities?” John Adams, professor of 
geography at University College London, wrote in one 
of his many essays on risk. “It appears that measures 
that protect drivers from the consequences of bad 
driving encourage bad driving. The principal effect of 
seat belt legislation has been a shift in the burden of 
risk from those already best protected in cars, to the 
most vulnerable, pedestrians and cyclists, outside cars.”
Adams started to group these counterintuitive findings 
under the concept of risk compensation, the idea that 
humans have an inborn tolerance for risk. As safety 
features are added to vehicles and roads, drivers feel 
less vulnerable and tend to take more chances. The 
phenomenon can be observed in all aspects of our daily 
lives. Children who wear protective gear during their 
games have a tendency to take more physical risks. 
Hikers take more risks when they think a rescuer can 
access them easily.

What should writers do when they’re teased by 
intriguing but elusive ideas, by hints of thoughts that 
seem too vague to be expressed in words? Edgar Allan 
Poe’s advice is simple: They should pick up their pens 
(or, he might add today, power up their laptops). Poe 
dismisses the argument that any ideas are so deep or 
subtle that they’re “                        .”
“For my own part,” he said in an 1846 article  in 
Graham’s Magazine, “I have never had a thought which 
I could not set down i n    w  o r d s, with even more 
distinctness than that with which I conceived it.” The 
“mere act” of writing, Poe believed, helps writers make
