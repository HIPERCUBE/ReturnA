23. To say that we need to curb anger and our negative 
thoughts and emotions does not mean that we should deny 
our feelings. There is an important distinction to be made 
between denial and restraint. The latter constitutes a 
deliberate and voluntarily adopted discipline based on an 
appreciation of the benefits of doing so. This is very 
different from the case of someone who suppresses 
emotions such as anger out of a feeling that they need to 
present a facade of self-control, or out of fear of what 
others may think. Such behaviour is like closing a wound 
which is still infected. We are not talking about 
rule-following. Where denial and suppression occur, there 
comes the danger that in doing so the individual 
anger and resentment. The trouble here is 
that at some future point they may find they cannot 
contain these feelings any longer.
