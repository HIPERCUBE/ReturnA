28. To describe what happens to common resources as a 
result of human greed, Garrett Hardin used the example 
of an area of pasture on which all the cattle-owners are 
permitted to graze their animals free of charge. Each 
cattle-owner seeks to (A)  his gain a nd in doing so 
considers the relative advantage and disadvantage of 
adding one more animal to the herd. The advantage is 
that the cattle-owner receives the whole of the profit 
from the sale of the additional animal. The disadvantage 
is that the extra grazing contributes to the deterioration of 
the pasture. However, the disadvantage is shared among 
all the cattle-owners using the pasture, so the individual 
owner suffers only a fraction of the disadvantage. 
Consequently, the advantage is bound to  (B)  the 
disadvantage. Thus, it is inevitable that more and more 
animals will be brought onto the pasture until overgrazing 
totally destroys the pasture.
