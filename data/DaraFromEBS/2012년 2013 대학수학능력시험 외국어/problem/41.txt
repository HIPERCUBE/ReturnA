Apologies often fail. One reason apologies fail is that 
the “offender” and the “victim” usually see the event 
differently. Examining personal narratives, researchers 
have found that those who cause harm tend to minimize 
the offense ― probably to protect themselves from shame 
and guilt. They also tend to downplay the consequences of 
their actions. ① These tendencies can inflame the anger 
of the hurt person, who, in contrast, may see an offense 
as bigger than it really is. ② When sincere apologies are 
offered in an ordinary human relationship, they are 
readily accepted by the victims and reconciliations ensue. 
③ Those who are hurt tend to see the act as one with 
severe consequences and as part of an ongoing pattern 
that is inexcusable and immoral. ④ Each person has his 
or her own truth, and there is distortion on both sides. 
⑤ Therefore, to apologize sincerely we must first listen 
attentively to how the other person really feels about 
what happened ― not simply assert what we think 
happened.
