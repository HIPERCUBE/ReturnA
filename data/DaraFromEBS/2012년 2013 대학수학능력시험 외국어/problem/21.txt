We take it for granted that film directors are in the 
game of recycling. Adapting novels ① is one of the most 
respectable of movie projects, while a book that calls 
itself the novelization of a film is considered barbarous. 
Being a hybrid art as well as a late one, film has always 
been in a dialogue with ② other narrative genres. Movies 
were first seen as an exceptionally potent kind of illusionist 
theatre, the rectangle of the screen corresponding to the 
proscenium of a stage, ③ which appear actors. Starti ng in 
the early silent period, plays were regularly “turned into” 
films. But ④ filming plays  d id    n o t  e ncourage the evolution 
of what truly was distinctive about a movie: the intervention 
of the camera ― its mobility of vision. As a source of plot, 
ch aracter, and dialogue, the novel seemed more ⑤ suitable. 
M any early successes of cinema were adaptations of 
po pular novels.
