As you are well aware, a great tragedy took place in 
our city last week. Some faulty electrical wiring led to a 
fire breaking out and eventually destroying an entire 
block of homes in the suburbs. From the very  beginning 
it was fanned by strong winds, but it would not have 
spread so far and so quickly, if our firefighters had been 
able to arrive at the scene in time. Our city has only one   
fire station located downtown. Would you please establish 
a new fire station in our area, since you are mayor of 
our city? We are in urgent need of one. I look forward 
to your response.

19. 밑줄 친 she[her]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Ellen Langer learned from her mother how to prepare a 
roast. As a little girl, ① she would watch as her mother 
cut off a small bit from one end of the meat before  
placing it in the roasting pan. As an adult, ② she followed 
the same routine. How ever, a question occurred to ③ her 
one day. Why did she have to cut off the end of the 
roast? She asked her mother, who just said she’d learned 
to do it from her own mother. Then Langer asked her 
grandmother. She explained that when she was a young 
mother, the only roasting pan ④ she’d had was too short 
for a standard roast, so she had to cut off the end to fit 
it into the pan. She’d long since gotten roasting pans in 
larger sizes and hadn’t cut an end off since. Yet for 
years both Langer and ⑤ her mother had mindlessly 
followed this routine.
20. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 어법에 맞는 표현으로 가장 
적절한 것은?
In many countries, amongst younger people, the habit of 
reading newspapers has been on the decline and some of 
the dollars previously (A) spent / were spent on newspaper 
advertising have migrated to the Internet. Of course some 
of this decline in newspaper reading has been due to the 
fact that we are doing more of our newspaper reading 
online. We can read the news of the day, or the latest on 
business, entertainment or (B) however / whatever news on 
the websites of the New York Times, the Guardian or almost 
any other major newspaper in the world. Increasingly, we 
can access these stories wirelessly by mobile devices as 
well as our computers. Advertising dollars have simply 
been (C) followed / following the migration trail across to 
these new technologies.
(A) (B) (C)
① spent …… however …… followed
② spent …… whatever …… following
③ were spent …… however …… following
④ were spent …… whatever …… followed
⑤ were spent …… whatever …… following
21. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
We take it for granted that film directors are in the 
game of recycling. Adapting novels ① is one of the most 
respectable of movie projects, while a book that calls 
itself the novelization of a film is considered barbarous. 
Being a hybrid art as well as a late one, film has always 
been in a dialogue with ② other narrative genres. Movies 
were first seen as an exceptionally potent kind of illusionist 
theatre, the rectangle of the screen corresponding to the 
proscenium of a stage, ③ which appear actors. Starti ng in 
the early silent period, plays were regularly “turned into” 
films. But ④ filming plays  d id    n o t  e ncourage the evolution 
of what truly was distinctive about a movie: the intervention 
of the camera ― its mobility of vision. As a source of plot, 
ch aracter, and dialogue, the novel seemed more ⑤ suitable. 
M any early successes of cinema were adaptations of 
po pular novels.
* proscenium: 앞 무대
22. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
I watched the beautiful stretch of the shoreline as it 
floated into view. How wonderful it was! After two days 
at sea, I finally saw the land of infinite opportunities. 
There it was before me ― smiling and inviting; it was 
difficult for anyone to decline that invitation. I was full 
of great plans to find success in this unknown land. I 
had accepted a job offer from Dr. Gilbert, who had 
opened a medical clinic at an inland villa ge last year. It 
gave me great pleasure to think about how my dream 
would become a reality. I looked again at the coast. The 
line of distant mountains and shapes of houses were 
gradually emerging through the mist. They welcomed me 
with endless promises.
① excited and hopeful ② sad and depressed
③ relieved and sympathetic ④ scared and frightened
⑤ ashamed and embarrassed

23. To say that we need to curb anger and our negative 
thoughts and emotions does not mean that we should deny 
our feelings. There is an important distinction to be made 
between denial and restraint. The latter constitutes a 
deliberate and voluntarily adopted discipline based on an 
appreciation of the benefits of doing so. This is very 
different from the case of someone who suppresses 
emotions such as anger out of a feeling that they need to 
present a facade of self-control, or out of fear of what 
others may think. Such behaviour is like closing a wound 
which is still infected. We are not talking about 
rule-following. Where denial and suppression occur, there 
comes the danger that in doing so the individual 
anger and resentment. The trouble here is 
that at some future point they may find they cannot 
contain these feelings any longer.
* facade: 표면, 겉
① fades out ② copes with ③ stores up
④ soothes ⑤ overestimates
24. Have you ever heard anyone say of a dog, “Well, he’s 
very successful and lives in a beautiful house, but he’s 
not very happy”? One reason most dogs are much happier 
than most people is that dogs aren’t affected by external 
circumstances the way we are. I notice that even when it’s 
pouring rain outside, my dogs, Blue and Celeste , are still 
excited to go for a walk. As soon as I open the front door 
to look outside, they’re beside me in a flash, standing 
expectantly, ready for an adventure. I usually wait for a   
break in the downpour, and then we all dash out together. 
The fact that the ground is wet and there are mud 
puddles dotting the landscape                          . 
While I’m carefully picking my way around the wet 
spots, the dogs are joyfully splashing right through them. 
They aren’t afraid to get their paws dirty.
① motivates us to take a shorter walk
② stirs great excitement in me
③ puts the dogs in trouble
④ means nothing to the dogs
⑤ makes me want to wander around
25. In Belding’s ground squirrels, males leave home and 
females mature in their natal area. This male-biased dispersal 
creates an imbalance in the way males and females are 
related to those individuals around them ― females find  
themselves surrounded by relatives, while males are generally 
in areas with complete  strangers. This asymmetry translates 
into females who warn close kin by emitting alarm calls, 
while males generally do not emit calls since their dispersal 
from their natal areas means their blood kin typically do 
not benefit from such a warning. Further support for the 
kinship-based alarm-calling hypothesis includes Sherman’s 
finding that in the rare instances when females do move 
away from their natal groups and into groups with far fewer 
relatives, they                                       .
① end up acquiring the alarm calls of the new group
② make constant attempts to bring their blood kin along
③ display a tendency to become more active and cooperative
④ emit alarm calls less frequently than do native females
⑤ adopt a more elaborate defense mechanism than alarm 
calls
26. By likening the eye to a camera, elementary biology 
textbooks help to produce a misleading impression of 
what perception entails. Only in terms of the physics of 
image formation do the eye and camera have anything in 
common. Both eye and camera have a lens that focuses 
light rays from the outside world into an image, and both 
have a means of adjusting the focus and brightness of 
that image. Both eye and camera have a light-sensitive 
layer onto which the image is cast (the retina and film, 
respectively). However, image formation is only the first 
step towards seeing.  
obscure the much more fundamental difference between 
the two, which is that the camera merely records an 
image, whereas the visual system interprets it. [3점]
① Apparent differences in the focusing power of a lens
② Superficial analogies between the eye and a camera
③ Contrasts in light adaptation between the retina and 
film
④ Misunderstandings of image formation in the eye and 
a camera
⑤ Close relationships between image formation and 
interpretation
27. Recent evidence suggests that the common ancestor of 
Neanderthals and modern people, living about 400,000 
years ago, may have already been using pretty sophisticated 
language. If language is based on genes and is the key to 
cultural evolution, and Neanderthals had language, then 
why did the Neanderthal toolkit show so little cultural 
change? Moreover, genes would undoubtedly have changed 
during the human revolution after 200,000 years ago, but 
more in response to new habits than as causes of them. At 
an earlier date, cooking selected mutations for smaller guts 
and mouths, rather than vice versa. At a later date,  milk 
drinking selected for mutations for retaining lactose digestion 
into adulthood in people of western European and East 
African descent.                                                . 
The appeal to a genetic change driving evolution gets 
gene-culture co-evolution backwards: it is a top-down 
ex planation for a bottom-up process. [3점]

① Genetic evolution is the mother of new habits
②  Every gene is the architect of its own mutation
③  The cultural horse comes before the genetic cart
④ The linguistic shovel paves the way for a cultural road
⑤ When the cultural cat is away, the genetic mice will play

것을 고르시오.
28. To describe what happens to common resources as a 
result of human greed, Garrett Hardin used the example 
of an area of pasture on which all the cattle-owners are 
permitted to graze their animals free of charge. Each 
cattle-owner seeks to (A)  his gain a nd in doing so 
considers the relative advantage and disadvantage of 
adding one more animal to the herd. The advantage is 
that the cattle-owner receives the whole of the profit 
from the sale of the additional animal. The disadvantage 
is that the extra grazing contributes to the deterioration of 
the pasture. However, the disadvantage is shared among 
all the cattle-owners using the pasture, so the individual 
owner suffers only a fraction of the disadvantage. 
Consequently, the advantage is bound to  (B)  the 
disadvantage. Thus, it is inevitable that more and more 
animals will be brought onto the pasture until overgrazing 
totally destroys the pasture. 
(A) (B) (A) (B)
① maximize …… equal ② distribute …… diminish
③ maximize …… exceed ④  distribute …… outweigh
⑤ maximize …… minimize
29. In physics, scientists invent models, or theories, to 
describe and predict the data we observe about the 
universe. Newton’s theory of gravity is one example; 
Einstein’s theory of gravity is another. Those theories, 
though they describe the same phenomenon, constitute 
very different versions of reality. Newton, (A) , 
imagined that masses affect each other by exerting a 
force, while in Einstein’s theory the effects occur through 
a bending of space and time and there is no concept of 
gravity as a force. Either theory could be employed to 
describe, with great accuracy, the falling of an apple, but 
Newton’s would be much easier to use. (B) , for 
the calculations necessary for the satellite-based global 
positioning system (GPS) that helps you navigate while 
driving, Newton’s theory would give the wrong answer, 

(A) (B)
① for example …… On the other hand
② for example …… As a result
③ therefore …… As a result
④ moreover …… Likewise  
⑤ moreover …… On the other hand

Researchers have suggested that maintaining good social 
relations depends on two ① complementary processes: 
being sensitive to the needs of others and being motivated 
to make amends or pay compensation when a violation 
does occur. In short, maintaining good social relations 
depends on the ② capacity for guilt. Martin L. Hoffman, 
who has focused on the guilt that comes from harming 
others, suggests that the motivational basis for this guilt 
is empathetic distress. Empathetic distress occurs when 
people ③ deny that their actions have caused harm or 
pain to another person. Motivated by feelings of guilt,  
they are ④ inclined  to make amends for their actions. 
Making amends serves to repair damaged social relations 
and ⑤ restore group harmony.

적절한 것은?
Anxiety has a damaging effect on mental performance of 
all kinds. It is in one sense a useful response gone awry ― 
an overly zealous mental preparation for an anticipated threat. 
But such mental rehearsal is (A) disastrous / constructive  
cognitive static when it becomes trapped in a stale routine 
that captures attention, intruding on all other attempts to focus 
elsewhere. Anxiety undermines the intellect. In a complex, 
intellectually demanding and high-pressure task such as that 
of air traffic controllers, for example, having chronically 
high anxiety is an almost sure predictor that a person 
will eventually fail in training or in the field. The anxious 
are more likely to fail even given (B) inferior / superior
scores on intelligence tests, as a study of 1,790 students in 
training for air traffic control posts discovered. Anxiety 
also sabotages academic performance of all kinds: 126 
different studies of more than 36,000 people found that the 
more (C) prone / resistant to anxieties a person is, the 
poorer his or her academic performance is.
* go awry: 빗나가다

33. Gregorio Dati에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Gregorio Dati was a successful merchant of Florence, 
who entered into many profitable partnerships dealing in 
wool, silk, and other merchandise. His career, however, 
especially early on, knew the vicissitudes characteristic of 
Renaissance business. For example, while he was en 
route to Spain as his enterprise’s traveling partner, a role 
typical for young men, pirates robbed him of all his 
goods, including a consignment of pearls, and of his own 
clothes. His recovery from such losses followed in part 
from four successive marriages. Later in life, he was 
honored to serve a number of posts in the city 
government. Over the years he wrote a “diary,” actually 
an occasional record in which he kept accounts of his 
commercial and family life. Men of his kind pioneered 
this form of writing about the public and private self.
* vicissitudes: 파란만장
** consignment: 위탁판매품
① Florence  상인으로서 성공하지 못했다.
② Spain으로 가는 길에 자신의 옷을 제외한 모든 것을 약탈
당했다.
③ 네 번의 잇따른 결혼으로 경제적 손실을 입었다.
④ 인생 후반에 시 정부에서 다수의 직책을 맡았다. 
⑤ 자신의 가족생활을 매일 기록한 일기를 썼다.
34. Great Salt Lake에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는  
것은?
The Great Salt Lake is the largest salt lake in the 
Western Hemisphere. The lake is fed by the Bear, Weber, 
and Jordan rivers and has no outlet. At the clo se of the 
Ice Age the entire region was submerged beneath a lake 
of meltwater, and overflow from the lake flowed into the 
Pacific Ocean through the Snake and Columbia rivers. The 
great climatic change the lake underwent and continued  
evaporation, exceeding the inflow of fresh water, reduced 
the lake to one-twentieth of its former size. The majority 
of salt in the Great Salt Lake is a remnant of dissolved 
salts that are present in all fresh water. As the water 
evaporated, the traces of dissolved salts were gradually 
concentrated in the shrinking lake.

35. Although praise may encourage children to continue an 
activity while an adult is watching, according to recent   
studies, they are less  likely to continue the activity when 
the adult leaves or to repeat the activity in the future. 
Rather than increasing children’s commitment to positive 
behavior, praise encourages children to find ways to get 
future verbal “goodies” from important adults. In other 
words, praise is like the large pink icing rose in the center 
of a cake. It is appealing and at first bite its sweetness 
tastes wonderful. A couple more bites still might taste 
good, but it quickly becomes overly sweet. It has only 
one simple flavor; we soon tire of it and if we eat very 
much at any one time, we might even feel slightly ill. It 
may provide some quick energy but it provides no 
nourishment and doesn’t support growth or health.

② 칭찬받는 어린이는 정신적으로 건강하게 성장한다.
③ 칭찬은 어린이의 바람직한 행동을 유발할 수 있다.
④ 어린이를 칭찬할 때는 달콤한 언어를 삼가야 한다.
⑤ 어린이를 칭찬하는 어른은 일관성을 유지해야 한다.
36. What’s dangerous about the Internet is, because it has 
the aura of technology around it, it has a totally 
undeserved instant credibility. The fact that information is 
conveyed in this high-tech manner somehow adds 
authority to what is conveyed, when in fact the Internet is 
a global conveyer of unfiltered, unedited, untreated 
information. It is the greatest tool we have not only for 
making people smarter quicker, but also for making people 
dumber faster. Rumors published on the Internet now have 
a way of immediately becoming facts. This is particularly 
true among people who might not themselves have access 
to the Internet but hear a piece of news or gossip from 
the people around them who do have access.

[37~38] 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
37. Why is it difficult to find a runner who competes 
equally well in both 100-m and 10,000-m races? The 
primary reason is that our muscles contain two main 
types of muscle fibers, called slow and fast muscle fibers. 
Slow muscle fibers are muscle cells that can sustain 
repeated contractions but don’t generate a lot of quick 
power for the body. They perform better in endurance 
exercises, like long-distance running, which require slow, 
steady muscle activity. Fast muscle fibers are cells  that 
can contract more quickly and powerfully than slow 
muscle fibers but fatigue m u c h   m o r e easily; they function 
best for short bursts of intense activity, like weight lifting 
or  sprinting.
①  reasons for runners to develop strong muscles
②  differences between slow and fast muscle fibers
③ comparison of sprinting with long-distance running
④ necessity of building muscles for long-distance runners
⑤ relationship between muscle fibers and physical fatigue
38. Scientists should be careful to reduce bias in their 
experiments. A bias occurs when what the scientist expects 
changes how the results are viewed. This expectation might 
cause a scientist to select a result from one trial over those 
from other trials. Scientists can lessen bias by running as 
many trials as possible and by keeping accurate notes of 
each observation made. Valid experiments  also must have 
data that are measurable. This allows others to compare 
the results to data they obtain from a similar experiment. 
Most importantly, the experiment must be repeatable. 
Findings are supportable when other scientists perform the 
same experiment and get the same results.
① necessary conditions of repeatable experiments 
② importance of identifying bias in scientific research
③ requirements for objective scientific experiments
④ guidelines for collecting measurable data in experiments
⑤ effective strategies for keeping accurate notes on data

39. I once heard a woman say, “Of course, he’s successful. 
It’s in his genes.” I knew she wasn’t talking about me, 
because I was wearing shorts. I also knew she was wrong. 
Success is not in our genes. Not all children of successful 
people become successful themselves. Many kids have 
everything going for them and end up total disasters. They 
do none of the things that helped their parents succeed. 
The number of unsuccessful people who come from 
successful parents is proof that genes have nothing to do 
with success. You can’t change your genes, but you can 
change the people you imitate. The choice is up to you, 
so why not imitate the best? There are hundreds of great 
people to imitate and copy. They have terrific advice about 
what helped them succeed. Jot down notes and carry 
them around in your pants pocket. Then success will be 
in your jeans, even if it’s not in your genes.

① Like Father, Like Son
② Want Success? Take a Recess!
③ The Myth of the Self-Made Man Is No More
④ Stick to Your Genes and Excel!
⑤ Follow the Best and Succeed!  
40. In the early 1990s Norway introduced a carbon tax on 
emissions from energy, and it did seem to encourage 
environmental innovation. However, unexpected circumstances 
came when they tried to apply this approach globally. 
Agreeing on international taxes on emissions was 
notoriously hard, as we already know that the European 
Union has experienced terrible difficulties in trying to 
regularize the complex and myriad differences in its 
members’ sales taxes. Besides, although Sweden, Finland, 
and Denmark barely decided to introduce carbon taxes 
during the 1990s, they have not harmonized their  
approaches with Norway or with each other. If such 
similar countries can’ t come to an agreement, there is 
little hope for doing so with the vastly more diverse 
countries in the rest of the world.

Apologies often fail. One reason apologies fail is that 
the “offender” and the “victim” usually see the event 
differently. Examining personal narratives, researchers 
have found that those who cause harm tend to minimize 
the offense ― probably to protect themselves from shame 
and guilt. They also tend to downplay the consequences of 
their actions. ① These tendencies can inflame the anger 
of the hurt person, who, in contrast, may see an offense 
as bigger than it really is. ② When sincere apologies are 
offered in an ordinary human relationship, they are 
readily accepted by the victims and reconciliations ensue. 
③ Those who are hurt tend to see the act as one with 
severe consequences and as part of an ongoing pattern 
that is inexcusable and immoral. ④ Each person has his 
or her own truth, and there is distortion on both sides. 
⑤ Therefore, to apologize sincerely we must first listen 
attentively to how the other person really feels about 
what happened ― not simply assert what we think 
happened.

When you walk into a store, you are besieged by 
information. Even purchases that seem simple can 
quickly turn into a cognitive quagmire. Look at the jam 
aisle.
(A) Rational models of decision-making suggest that the 
way to find the best product is to take all of this 
information into account and to carefully analyz e the 
different brands on display. But this method can 
backfire.          
(B ) A glance at the shelves can inspire a whole range of 
questions. Should you buy the smooth-textured 
strawberry jam or the one with less sugar? Does the 

more expensive jam taste better? 

(C ) When we spend too much time thinking in the 
supermarket, we can trick ourselves into choosing the 
wrong things for the wrong reasons. Making better 
decisions when picking out jams or bottles of wine is 
best done with the emotional brain, which generates its 
verdict automatically.

But now rock radio is in seemingly terminal decline and 
MTV doesn’t show many music videos anymore.
Once upon a time, there was only one way to launch a 
hit album: radio. Nothing else reached as many people, as 
often. Getting on a radio playlist was difficult, but once 
a song was in heavy rotation on the radio, it had a high 
probability of selling. Then, in the 1980s, came MTV, 
which became the second way to create a hit. ( ① ) It 
had even more limited capacity for new music, but its 
influence over a generation was unparalleled. ( ② ) For 
the music labels, those were good times; it was a brutally 
competitive business, but it was a business they knew.  
( ③ ) They understood the rules, and they could earn 
their keep by working them. ( ④ ) So how to market 
music? ( ⑤ ) Labels know the answer lies online, 
tapping the word-of-mouth forces that are replacing 
traditional marketing in creating demand, but they’re still 
trying to figure out exactly how best to do it.

Despite such evidence of favoritism toward handsome 
politicians, follow-up research demonstrated that voters 
did not realize their bias.

Research has shown that we automatically assign to 
good-looking individuals such favorable traits as talent, 
kindness, honesty, and intelligence. ( ① ) Furthermore,  
we make these judgements without being aware that 
physical attractiveness plays a role in the process. ( ② ) 
Some consequences of this unconscious assumption that 
“good-looking equals good” scare me. ( ③ ) For 
example, a study of the 1974 Canadian federal elections 
found that attractive candidates received more than two 
and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates. 
( ④ ) In fact, 73 percent of Canadian voters surveyed 
denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had 
been influenced by physical appearance; only 14 percent 
even allowed for the possibility of such influence. ( ⑤ ) 
Voters can deny the impact of attractiveness on 
electability all they want, but evidence has continued to 
confirm its troubling presence.

“Why, in country after country that mandated seat 
belts, was it impossible to see the promised reduction in 
road accident fatalities?” John Adams, professor of 
geography at University College London, wrote in one 
of his many essays on risk. “It appears that measures 
that protect drivers from the consequences of bad 
driving encourage bad driving. The principal effect of 
seat belt legislation has been a shift in the burden of 
risk from those already best protected in cars, to the 
most vulnerable, pedestrians and cyclists, outside cars.”
Adams started to group these counterintuitive findings 
under the concept of risk compensation, the idea that 
humans have an inborn tolerance for risk. As safety 
features are added to vehicles and roads, drivers feel 
less vulnerable and tend to take more chances. The 
phenomenon can be observed in all aspects of our daily 
lives. Children who wear protective gear during their 
games have a tendency to take more physical risks. 
Hikers take more risks when they think a rescuer can 
access them easily.

What should writers do when they’re teased by 
intriguing but elusive ideas, by hints of thoughts that 
seem too vague to be expressed in words? Edgar Allan 
Poe’s advice is simple: They should pick up their pens 
(or, he might add today, power up their laptops). Poe 
dismisses the argument that any ideas are so deep or 
subtle that they’re “                        .”
“For my own part,” he said in an 1846 article  in 
Graham’s Magazine, “I have never had a thought which 
I could not set down i n    w  o r d s, with even more 
distinctness than that with which I conceived it.” The 
“mere act” of writing, Poe believed, helps writers make 

their ideas not only clearer but more logical. To use his 
phr ase, the process of writing contributes to “the 
log icalization of thought.”
W henever he felt dissatisfied with a vague “conception 
of  the brain,” Poe said, “I resort forthwith to the pen, 
for the purpose of obtaining, through its aid, the 
necessary form, consequence and precision.”
Today’s advocates of freewriting would probably agree 
with Poe on this point. Sometimes, the best way to 
resolve a dilemma ― whether it’s a writing dilemma or 
a thinking dilemma ― is simply to start writing.

(A)
On May 29th there was a heavy rain but the sun came 
out the next day. Driving back from the village, I stopped 
the car because a small woodchuck was traveling 
along the road, its belly almost flat to the gravel. I got 
out, took off my sweater, threw it over the woodchuck and 
wrapped him in it, then put him on the floor of the car 
while I drove home. I guessed the rain had washed out his 
burrow. If I hadn’t come along (a) he would have eventually 
died of starvation. Rescuing him, I felt as large as Fate.
* woodchuck: 마멋(다람쥣과의 짐승)

(B)
Very shortly the carton seemed too small. I offered 
him a nest made of a covered box, bedded with straw 
and with a round doorway cut in the front. He knew 
instantly that a hole spells home, and (b) he  dashed 
inside. Every time I came to feed him, he jumped into 
my lap as eagerly as ever. As the months passed, the 
chuck grew bigger and bigger. My husband remarked  
that if I didn’t do something soon, I would be chased 
around for the rest of my days by a 15-pound 
woodchuck begging for milk.
(C)
At home I put him in the bathtub and my husband 
found a large carton. (c) He put cat litter in the bottom 
and straw on top of that. When I put the chuck in, he 
gratefully burrowed into the straw. I made a mixture of 
milk and baby cereal for him. When I gave it to the 
chuck, he ate it greedily. (d) He accepted me quickly. If 
I put my hand in the carton, he nibbled my fingers. It 
became clear that I was imprinting the woodchuck and 
vice versa.
* imprint: 강하게 인상지우다

(D)
I decided to put him in a new burrow. I found a hole 
along the wall of our orchard, put the chuck near it and 
left him. I continued to visit him with his milk. Each 
time (e) he greeted me joyfully, drank greedily, and tried 
persistently to follow me back into the house. The 
parting came unexpectedly. I went away on a brief trip. 
When I came back, I saw no sign of him. In the spring 
when I see a large, handsome woodchuck playing on 
the grass, I will hope that it is he.
