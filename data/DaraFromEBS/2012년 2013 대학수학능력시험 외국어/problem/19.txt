Ellen Langer learned from her mother how to prepare a 
roast. As a little girl, ① she would watch as her mother 
cut off a small bit from one end of the meat before  
placing it in the roasting pan. As an adult, ② she followed 
the same routine. How ever, a question occurred to ③ her 
one day. Why did she have to cut off the end of the 
roast? She asked her mother, who just said she’d learned 
to do it from her own mother. Then Langer asked her 
grandmother. She explained that when she was a young 
mother, the only roasting pan ④ she’d had was too short 
for a standard roast, so she had to cut off the end to fit 
it into the pan. She’d long since gotten roasting pans in 
larger sizes and hadn’t cut an end off since. Yet for 
years both Langer and ⑤ her mother had mindlessly 
followed this routine.
