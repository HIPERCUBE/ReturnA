40. In the early 1990s Norway introduced a carbon tax on 
emissions from energy, and it did seem to encourage 
environmental innovation. However, unexpected circumstances 
came when they tried to apply this approach globally. 
Agreeing on international taxes on emissions was 
notoriously hard, as we already know that the European 
Union has experienced terrible difficulties in trying to 
regularize the complex and myriad differences in its 
members’ sales taxes. Besides, although Sweden, Finland, 
and Denmark barely decided to introduce carbon taxes 
during the 1990s, they have not harmonized their  
approaches with Norway or with each other. If such 
similar countries can’ t come to an agreement, there is 
little hope for doing so with the vastly more diverse 
countries in the rest of the world.
