(A)
On May 29th there was a heavy rain but the sun came 
out the next day. Driving back from the village, I stopped 
the car because a small woodchuck was traveling 
along the road, its belly almost flat to the gravel. I got 
out, took off my sweater, threw it over the woodchuck and 
wrapped him in it, then put him on the floor of the car 
while I drove home. I guessed the rain had washed out his 
burrow. If I hadn’t come along (a) he would have eventually 
died of starvation. Rescuing him, I felt as large as Fate.
* woodchuck: 마멋(다람쥣과의 짐승)
