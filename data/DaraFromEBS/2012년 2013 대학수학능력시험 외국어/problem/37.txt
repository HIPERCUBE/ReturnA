37. Why is it difficult to find a runner who competes 
equally well in both 100-m and 10,000-m races? The 
primary reason is that our muscles contain two main 
types of muscle fibers, called slow and fast muscle fibers. 
Slow muscle fibers are muscle cells that can sustain 
repeated contractions but don’t generate a lot of quick 
power for the body. They perform better in endurance 
exercises, like long-distance running, which require slow, 
steady muscle activity. Fast muscle fibers are cells  that 
can contract more quickly and powerfully than slow 
muscle fibers but fatigue m u c h   m o r e easily; they function 
best for short bursts of intense activity, like weight lifting 
or  sprinting.
①  reasons for runners to develop strong muscles
②  differences between slow and fast muscle fibers
③ comparison of sprinting with long-distance running
④ necessity of building muscles for long-distance runners
⑤ relationship between muscle fibers and physical fatigue
