A way to get things done more efficiently and get better 
results is to do the right thing at the right time of day. Know 
your own body rhythm, respect your internal clock, and pay 
attention to how your energy level ebbs and flows during the 
day. If you have lots of energy early in the morning, that is 
when you should schedule difficult activities, whether for you 
these are brainstorming, writing, or practicing. Use the same 
principle in planning activities for your team. Schedule 
intervals of productive time and breaks so that you get the most 
from people. I always ask people to respect their own body 
rhythms when scheduling appointments. In my experience, 
most people are far more productive in the morning, but there 
are those who differ and hit their stride later in the day.
