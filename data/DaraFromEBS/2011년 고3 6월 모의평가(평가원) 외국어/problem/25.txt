25. Some people tend to be late as a general rule, whether they 
are busy or not. To stop being late, all one has to do is change 
the motivation by deciding that in all circumstances being 
on time is going to have first priority over any other 
consideration. Presto! You will never have to run for a plane 
or miss an appointment again. As a lifelong latecomer, that is 
how I cured myself. Having made the decision that  
was now of major importance, I found that answers came 
automatically to such questions as “Can I squeeze in one more 
errand before the dentist?” or “Do I have to leave for the 
airport now?” The answers are always no, and yes. Choosing 
to be on time will make your life enormously easier, and that 
of your family, friends, and colleagues as well.
