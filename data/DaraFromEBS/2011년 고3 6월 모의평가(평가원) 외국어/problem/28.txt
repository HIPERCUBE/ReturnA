28. Essentially, your reputation is your most valuable asset―
so guard it well. But do not be terribly demoralized if you make 
some mistakes along the way. With time it is possible to repair 
a stained reputation. Every experience you have with someone 
else is like a drop of water falling into a pool. As your 
experiences with that person grow, the drops accumulate and 
the pool deepens. Positive interactions are clear drops of water 
and negative interactions are red drops of water. But they 
are not equal. That is,    , and 
that number differs for different people. Those who are very 
forgiving only need a few positive experiences― clear drops
― to dilute a bad experience, while those who are less 
forgiving need a lot more to wash away the red. [3점]
