Lantin decided on a necklace which had been one of his 
wife’s favorites. ① It must be worth at least seven or eight 
francs he thought, because for an imitation piece the 
workmanship was very good. He put it in his pocket and went 
looking for a reliable-looking jeweler. At length he saw 
② one and went in, a little ashamed of selling something so 
worthless. “Monsieur,” he said to the dealer, “I’d like you to 
value ③ this piece for me if you’d be so kind.” The man took 
④ the article, examined it, turned it over, weighed it, and took 
up a magnifying glass to look at it more closely. Lantin was a 
little embarrassed by all this ceremony and was about to say, 
“Look, I’m pretty sure it’s got no value at all,” when the 
jeweler announced: “Monsieur, I’d put it at between 12,000 
and 15,000 francs. However, I could not purchase ⑤ this from 
you without knowing its exact provenance.”
