27. Some people believe that    is some kind 
of instinct, developed because it benefits our species in some 
way. At first, this seems like a strange idea: Darwin’s theories 
of evolution presume that individuals should act to preserve 
their own interests, not those of the species as a whole. But 
the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins believes 
that natural selection has given us the ability to feel pity for 
someone who is suffering. When humans lived in small 
clan-based groups, a person in need would be a relative or 
someone who could pay you back a good turn later, so taking 
pity on others could benefit you in the long run. Modern 
societies are much less close-knit and when we see a heartfelt 
appeal for charity, chances are we may never even meet the 
person who is suffering― but the emotion of pity is still in 
our genes. [3점]
