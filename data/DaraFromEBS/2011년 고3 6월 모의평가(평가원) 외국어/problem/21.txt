21. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
We want to stop watching so much TV, but demonstrably, 
we also want to watch lots of TV. So what we really want, it 
seems, ① is to stop wanting. We ② are trapped deep in a 
paradox: deciding on the best course of action, then doing 
something else. The way around this is ③ to see that habits 
are responses to needs. This sounds ④ obvious, but countless 
efforts at habit change ignore its implications. If you eat 
badly, you might resolve to start eating well. However, if you 
are eating burgers and ice-cream to feel comforted, relaxed 
and happy, ⑤ try to replace them with broccoli and carrot 
juice is like dealing with a leaky bathroom tap by repainting 
the kitchen. What is required is not a better diet, but an 
alternative way to feel comforted and relaxed.
