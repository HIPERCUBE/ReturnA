True understanding inevitably requires a knowledge of 
context. The proper way of understanding a beast in a zoo is 
a telling example. At the zoo, visitors may witness a great 
beast pacing behind the bars of its cage. They may observe 
and admire the creature, its amazing bone structure, and its 
magnificent coat. However, no matter how long visitors 
spend in front of that cage, they will never truly understand 
the beast. True understanding can only come from seeing the 
creature in its natural surroundings and, in turn, the ways in 
which its presence affects its environment. 
What is true of the mysterious beast in the zoo is also true 
of science. To fully understand science, it must be 
considered within the society in which it functions. Science 
is not conducted in a . It is embedded within a 
social fabric, and just as a flesh-and-blood beast influences 
and is influenced by its environment, so too do science and 
society mutually influence one another. Society, through 
ethical and economic constraints, exerts a powerful influence 
on what science accomplishes. At the same time, the results 
of science have profound, and sometimes unexpected, 
impacts on every human being on earth. Therefore, to make 
sense of science-related issues, it is critical to recognize the 
bidirectional relationship between science and society.
