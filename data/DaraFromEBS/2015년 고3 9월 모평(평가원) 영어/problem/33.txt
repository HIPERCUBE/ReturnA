33. It is easy to find examples of correlations which are far 
more systematic than could occur by chance and yet which it 
would be absurd to treat as evidence of a direct causal link. For 
instance, there is a high degree of correlation between shoe 
size and vocabulary size: people with larger shoe sizes tend to 
have much larger vocabularies than people with smaller shoe 
sizes. But having larger feet does not cause anyone to gain a 
larger vocabulary; nor does having a large vocabulary cause 
your feet to grow. The obvious explanation of the correlation 
is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults, and, 
because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they 
grow older, it is hardly surprising that, on average, people with 
smaller feet have smaller vocabularies. In other words, foot 
size and vocabulary size can be explained in terms of
from infancy 
to adulthood: a cause which both observed phenomena have in 
common. [3점]
