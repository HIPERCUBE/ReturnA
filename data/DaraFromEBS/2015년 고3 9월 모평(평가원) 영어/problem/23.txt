Effective coaches prioritize. They focus on a single task 
instead of trying to multitask. They understand that 
multitasking is another way of saying you are going to 
complete several tasks, none of which are going to be very 
good. Yuhong Jiang, professor of psychology at Harvard 
University, points out that the brain isn’t built to concentrate 
on two things at once. It works more slowly if it tries to. 
Effective coaches focus on those things that need to get done 
and separate out everything else. Separating what’s important 
from what’s not important is prioritizing. Ineffective coaches 
fail to put the big tasks first. They either believe they have 
unlimited time, thinking that they will have more time 
tomorrow to get something done, or they underestimate how 
much time they really do have. They have no ability to 
estimate how long a task will take.
