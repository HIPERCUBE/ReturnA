않은 것은?
An Egyptian executive, after entertaining his Canadian 
guest, offered him joint partnership in a new business venture. 
The Canadian, delighted with the offer, suggested that they 
meet again the next morning with their ① respective lawyers to 
finalize the details. The Egyptian never showed up. The 
surprised and disappointed Canadian tried to understand what 
had gone wrong: Did Egyptians ② lack punctuality? Was the 
Egyptian expecting a counter-offer? Were lawyers unavailable 
in Cairo? None of these explanations proved to be correct; 
rather, the problem was ③ caused by the different meaning 
Canadians and Egyptians attach to inviting lawyers. The 
Canadian regarded the lawyers’ ④ absence as facilitating the 
successful completion of the negotiation; the Egyptian 
interpreted it as signaling the Canadian’s mistrust of his 
verbal commitment. Canadians often use the impersonal 
formality of a lawyer’s services to finalize ⑤ agreements. 
Egyptians, by contrast, more frequently depend on the personal 
relationship between bargaining partners to accomplish the 
same purpose.
