37.
Analysis of the errors leads the teacher to modify the 
teaching of these procedures, using the language ‘seven 
and three more’ rather than ‘seven, count on three’.
A 5-year-old doing addition problems by counting on makes 
the same error repeatedly, with responses such as: 7 + 3 = 9, 
6 + 5 = 10 and 8 + 4 = 11. ( ① ) The teacher asks the pupil to 
show how these answers were obtained and notices that in 
doing the addition of 3 to 7, the pupil counts ‘seven, eight, 
nine’, while turning up three fingers in turn. ( ② ) The pupil 
is ‘counting on 3 from 7’ but incorrectly starting at 7. ( ③ ) 
The teacher recalls similar errors that some pupils made when 
doing addition problems by counting on along a number 
line. ( ④ ) This is immediately effective. ( ⑤ ) So the 
teacher reinforces this particular language pattern in 
subsequent oral work with the whole class.
