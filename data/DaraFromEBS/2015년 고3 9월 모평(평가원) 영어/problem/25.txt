25. Richard Porson에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는
것은?
Richard Porson, one of Britain’s most notable classical 
scholars, was born on Christmas in 1759. His talents were 
recognized early, and he was sent to Eton College by wealthy 
sponsors at 15. Four years later, he entered Cambridge 
University. He significantly improved Greek texts and edited 
four plays written by Euripides. In 1806, he was elected 
Principal Librarian at the newly founded London Institution. 
During his lifetime, he collected a great many books on 
classical literature. Although the number of books he owned 
in total is simply unknown, an episode about his passion for 
books is well-known: he carried so many books that he was 
able to pull book after book out of his pocket when a student 
tried to show off his knowledge of Greek writers. Despite his 
fame as a classical scholar, he actually published little. On 
September 25, 1808, three months before reaching age 49, 
Porson died.
