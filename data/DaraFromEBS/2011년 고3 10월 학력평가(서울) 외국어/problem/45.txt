Sandra Lee, who is famous for her Semi‑Homemade, 
understands the delicate balance between the desire to 
feel the pride of ownership and the wish not to spend 
too much time in the kitchen. According to Lee, 
housewives can feel the joy of creation while saving 
time by using ready‑made products for seventy percent 
of the process (cake mix, store‑bought minced garlic, a 
jar of marinara sauce) and thirty percent “fresh, creative 
touches” (a bit of honey and vanilla in the cake mix, or 
fresh eggs and vegetables instead of dried ones). 
Housewives can combine off‑the‑shelf products with just 
the right amount of personalization. Lee’s TV show, 
magazine, and numerous cookbooks offer evidence that a 
spoonful of ownership is a crucial ingredient in the 
psychological exercise that is cooking.
