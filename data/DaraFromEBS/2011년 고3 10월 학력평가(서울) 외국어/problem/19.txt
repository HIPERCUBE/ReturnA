A few months ago, a turtle in Thailand was grievously 
injured when it was run over by a truck. ① The animal hardly 
seemed to have any chance of survival. However, with the 
immediate help of the Thai Animal Guardians Association, it 
did survive. The Association admitted ② the victim to 
Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University for medical treatment. 
③ The little survivor was named Jikko and the Bangkok Post 
kept readers updated on the animal’s progress. Jikko is now 
quite fit and a fiberglass shell has been placed over its 
broken outer shell to speed up the healing process. This 
means that ④ the patient is the only turtle in Thailand to 
have a fiberglass shell! This is made from dental plate 
material and will crack and fall off when ⑤ the natural 
counterpart is fully restored.
