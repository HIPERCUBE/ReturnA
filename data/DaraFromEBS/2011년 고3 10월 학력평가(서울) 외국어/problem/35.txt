35. When we start designing something, we sketch out ideas 
with a big, thick marker, instead of a ball‑point pen. Why? 
Pen points are too fine. They encourage you to worry about 
things that you shouldn’t worry about yet, like perfecting the 
shading or whether to use a dotted or dashed line. You end 
up focusing on things that should still be out of focus. A 
marker makes it impossible to drill down that deep. You can 
only draw shapes, lines, and boxes. That’s good. The big 
picture is all you should be worrying about in the beginning. 
You need to approach your idea in the same way. Getting 
obsessed with details too early leads to disagreement, 
meetings, and delays. You get lost in things that don’t really 
matter. You waste your time on decisions that are going to 
change anyway.
