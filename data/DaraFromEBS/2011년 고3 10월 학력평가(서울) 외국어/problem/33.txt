33. 다음 글에 드러난 Shay의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
Shay and his father were walking past a park where some 
boys Shay knew were playing baseball. “Do you think they’ll 
let me play?” Shay anxiously asked his father although he 
knew they wouldn’t let him join them because of his 
handicap. How many times had he been denied playing in a 
game since he hurt his leg severely three years ago? Shay’s 
father looked at his son, overwhelmed with pity. He 
approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay 
could play, not expecting much. The boy looked at Shay and 
said, “We’re losing by six runs, and the game is in the eighth 
inning. I guess he can be on our team, and we’ll try to put 
him in to bat in the ninth inning.” Shay struggled over to the 
team’s bench and put on a team shirt with a broad smile on 
his face and tears in his eyes.
