34. I once visited a ski resort while our company was producing 
one of our first televised ski races. Upon arriving, I 
immediately looked for the head of our television division who 
was overseeing the event. To my surprise, I was told he was 
out on the side of the mountain setting up camera angles with 
the crew. That would have been an acceptable place for him 
to be if he had still been a producer. But as a division head, I 
expected him to be at the base of the mountain, directing the 
event on the whole. Because he hadn’t grasped his new 
position, this executive went back to the old, comfortable 
position without realizing that his new position required him to 
sacrifice some of his old ways.
