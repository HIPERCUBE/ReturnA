When I moved out of Apartment 350 in Mellon Manor, I 
was denied a refund of my initial $450 deposit because the 
apartment was not cleaned. At the time of checkout, Mr. 
Vegas, the local manager, provided an inventory showing that 
all appliances were working properly and noted only the 
unclean apartment as the reason for refusing the refund. I 
cleaned the apartment the next day, requested a 
reinspection, and was told by Mr. Vegas that he would mail 
the deposit check. The check has never arrived, although 
I’ve made three follow‑up calls to his office. Please check 
into this matter immediately and mail the deposit refund to 
me at the address above.
