How many times do you get caught in the middle of other 
people’s dramas because you are such a “nice” person? How 
often does being nonassertive cause you to feel responsible 
for solving other people’s problems? If you spend most of 
your time feeling responsible for everyone else, you won’t 
have enough time to care for yourself and meet your own 
goals. You have to be very selective about whom you will 
help and how involved you get if you don’t want to get 
overloaded. There’s a fine line here. Only you can decide 
when to cross it. Be careful, because many of the problems 
others bring to your doorstep cannot be solved by you; they 
can be solved only by the others themselves.
