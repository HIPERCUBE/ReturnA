brands are also activated in the minds of your target audience. 
When ninety‑six volunteers were shown a list of familiar banks 
and then asked whether a familiar but non‑listed bank was on 
the list, seventy‑one percent of them said yes. About a third 
of the people who said yes claimed that their answers were

explanation for this                           is that when we 
see or hear a list of associated words it awakens other related 
concepts in our minds. When we are tested on what was 
actually presented, it is hard for us to distinguish between 
concepts that have been activated externally by seeing or 
hearing them, or internally by association.

② occurrence of false memory
③ false accusation of advertisers
④ disadvantage of short‑term memory
⑤ heated competition between volunteers
