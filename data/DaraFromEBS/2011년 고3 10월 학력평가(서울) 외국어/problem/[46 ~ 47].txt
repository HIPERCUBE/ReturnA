While I was staying at a world‑renowned hotel in 
Bogota, Colombia, the general manager commented to me 
that he had recently hired some new hotel guards, and 
although he couldn’t put his finger on it, there was 
something about them he didn’t like. He knew that I had 
worked in law enforcement for the FBI, and he asked 
whether I had noticed anything bothersome about his 
new staff members. We walked outside where the guards 
were posted and took a quick glance. The manager noted 
that although they had new uniforms and their boots 
were shined, something wasn’t right. I agreed that the 
uniforms looked professional, but pointed out that the 
guards were standing with their thumbs in their pockets, 
making them look weak and incompetent.
At first the manager didn’t seem to grasp what I was 
saying until I had him demonstrate the posture himself. 
Immediately he said, “You are right. They look like little 
kids waiting for their mother to tell them what to eat and 
what to wear.” The next day the guards were shown how 
to stand and look authoritative (hands behind back, chin 
up) without looking threatening to the guests. Sometimes 
little things mean a lot. In this case, the disappearing 
thumbs became indicators which showed                 
— not exactly what you want from a security force, 
especially in Bogota, Colombia.
