Democracies require more equality if they are ①to grow 
stronger. The problem is that globalization pushes in the 
opposite direction; by placing a premium on high skills that 
make workers more ②competitively, it increases income 
inequality between the highly skilled minority and the rest. In 
this situation, it is not sufficient ③to reduce economic 
insecurity by expanding the social safety net. Instead, a country 
must begin to make the transition from a welfare state to a 
workfare state, with an emphasis on creating a more highly 
skilled labor force and ④improving access to the labor market 
for women and low‑income youth. To expand job creation, new 
social policies must also provide better incentives for 
entrepreneurship and innovation. Only then can social policies 
⑤be considered key factors of production, beyond their role as 
instruments of social protection. * entrepreneurship: 창업 의욕
