When I moved out of Apartment 350 in Mellon Manor, I 
was denied a refund of my initial $450 deposit because the 
apartment was not cleaned. At the time of checkout, Mr. 
Vegas, the local manager, provided an inventory showing that 
all appliances were working properly and noted only the 
unclean apartment as the reason for refusing the refund. I 
cleaned the apartment the next day, requested a 
reinspection, and was told by Mr. Vegas that he would mail 
the deposit check. The check has never arrived, although 
I’ve made three follow‑up calls to his office. Please check 
into this matter immediately and mail the deposit refund to 
me at the address above.

A few months ago, a turtle in Thailand was grievously 
injured when it was run over by a truck. ① The animal hardly 
seemed to have any chance of survival. However, with the 
immediate help of the Thai Animal Guardians Association, it 
did survive. The Association admitted ② the victim to 
Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University for medical treatment. 
③ The little survivor was named Jikko and the Bangkok Post 
kept readers updated on the animal’s progress. Jikko is now 
quite fit and a fiberglass shell has been placed over its 
broken outer shell to speed up the healing process. This 
means that ④ the patient is the only turtle in Thailand to 
have a fiberglass shell! This is made from dental plate 
material and will crack and fall off when ⑤ the natural 
counterpart is fully restored.
20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
How many times do you get caught in the middle of other 
people’s dramas because you are such a “nice” person? How 
often does being nonassertive cause you to feel responsible 
for solving other people’s problems? If you spend most of 
your time feeling responsible for everyone else, you won’t 
have enough time to care for yourself and meet your own 
goals. You have to be very selective about whom you will 
help and how involved you get if you don’t want to get 
overloaded. There’s a fine line here. Only you can decide 
when to cross it. Be careful, because many of the problems 
others bring to your doorstep cannot be solved by you; they 
can be solved only by the others themselves.
① 책임감 있게 일을 추진해야 한다.

⑤ 시간적 여유를 가지고 문제를 해결해야 한다.
21. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
Democracies require more equality if they are ①to grow 
stronger. The problem is that globalization pushes in the 
opposite direction; by placing a premium on high skills that 
make workers more ②competitively, it increases income 
inequality between the highly skilled minority and the rest. In 
this situation, it is not sufficient ③to reduce economic 
insecurity by expanding the social safety net. Instead, a country 
must begin to make the transition from a welfare state to a 
workfare state, with an emphasis on creating a more highly 
skilled labor force and ④improving access to the labor market 
for women and low‑income youth. To expand job creation, new 
social policies must also provide better incentives for 
entrepreneurship and innovation. Only then can social policies 
⑤be considered key factors of production, beyond their role as 
instruments of social protection. * entrepreneurship: 창업 의욕

적절한 것은?
Most amateur speakers do not understand that when they 
are on stage they are actors and actresses. Most do have 
some idea that they should speak with more power on stage 
than they (A) are / do  on a one‑to‑one basis, but they do not 
realize that their verbal eloquence must be matched with a 
nonverbal eloquence. If you move your hand two inches to 
emphasize a point when (B) speaking / to speak  to one 
person, you may have to move it as much as two feet in 
front of a large audience. The general rule is, the bigger the 
audience, the bigger the motion. This is so difficult for 
people, especially businesspeople whose general style is that 
of understatement, (C) which / that  they should take an acting 
course before they take a speech course.
(A) (B) (C)
① are  speaking  which
② are  to speak  which
③ do  to speak  that
④ do  to speak  which
⑤ do  speaking  that
23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Development strategies focus on economic growth without 
recognizing the role of functioning natural systems for local 
well‑being. This is because services that nature provides are 
often not visible. ① Wetlands are a good example; 
conserving wetlands appears to provide few benefits, and 
few economic costs are associated with their conservation 
and loss. ② Consequently, wetlands are converted in favor of 
more profitable options such as dams or irrigation schemes. 
③ Since the costs of running these dams do not fall 
correspondingly, the cost of generating a given amount of 
electricity rises. ④ But the problem is not that wetlands 
have no economic value, but that this value — e.g. waste 
water purification and water regulation — is poorly understood 
and frequently overlooked in decision‑making. ⑤ Local 
planners are often unaware that many natural solutions are

24. A person who works on an assembly line is well aware of 
the efficiency that can be gained through repetition. The 
craftsmen who work on building clocks gain tremendous 
efficiency between the first time a clock is built and the 
hundredth time. After multiple repetitions of the same routine, 
the assembly person instinctively knows where to reach for 
each subsequent part. They learn how best to grasp and 
position the new parts to insure the gears are aligned and 
components are properly seated. Over time the movements 
become fluid and instinctive. There is little brainpower needed 
for each new assembly as the mind wanders and the body 
simply goes through the motions. Every manufacturing plant 
worker or manager is well aware of the value of              .
① familiarity ② honesty ③ curiosity
④ creativity ⑤ scarcity
25. Whenever you advertise your brand, your competitor’s 
brands are also activated in the minds of your target audience. 
When ninety‑six volunteers were shown a list of familiar banks 
and then asked whether a familiar but non‑listed bank was on 
the list, seventy‑one percent of them said yes. About a third 
of the people who said yes claimed that their answers were 
based on vivid memory and not on simple guessing. One 
explanation for this                           is that when we 
see or hear a list of associated words it awakens other related 
concepts in our minds. When we are tested on what was 
actually presented, it is hard for us to distinguish between 
concepts that have been activated externally by seeing or 
hearing them, or internally by association.
① sudden loss of memory
② occurrence of false memory
③ false accusation of advertisers
④ disadvantage of short‑term memory
⑤ heated competition between volunteers
26. A social function of religion is to prompt reflection concerning 
conduct. In this context, religion plays a role in social control, 
which does not rely on law alone. Religion sets guidelines for 
acceptable behavior. This is done through notions of right and 
wrong, good and evil. Usually, religious myths feature tales of 
supernatural beings that in various ways illustrate the society’s 
ethical code in action. Right actions earn the approval of the 
supernatural power which is recognized by a particular culture. 
Wrong actions may cause punishment through supernatural 
agencies. In short, by raising people’s feelings of guilt and 
anxiety about their actions, religion                          .
① helps keep people in line
② explains death and afterlife
③ reveals the mystery of the universe
④ distinguishes itself from superstition
27. To improve their own chances of survival, some parasites 
cause their hosts to act in ways that are very different from 
their normal behavior. When a thorny‑headed worm reaches 
maturity inside a pillbug, it causes the pillbug to move out 
into the light, against its normal urge. Exposed, the pillbug 
is more likely to be eaten by a bird. If it is eaten, the 
thorny‑headed worm then enters the next stage of its life 
cycle inside the bird, its new host. There are dozens of 
examples like this. In most cases, the parasite  
by adjusting levels of hormones 
in the host’s body. In at least one case, the parasite actually 
manipulates the host’s DNA directly, turning certain genes 
on or off. * pillbug: 쥐며느리 (절지동물)
① keeps its host out of danger
② takes over its host’s behavior
③ reduces its chances of survival
④ drops its habit of living inside the host
⑤ indirectly provides a benefit for its host
28. A researcher carried out a series of tasks in full view of 
twenty‑four toddlers — stacking books or hanging towels with 
clothespins. Occasionally he struggled with the task, dropping 
the clothespins or knocking over the books. Every one of 
the toddlers crawled over to help him pick up the pins or 
books, but only in those instances where his facial and 
bodily gestures suggested he needed assistance. He said that 
the babies didn’t offer their help when he purposely dropped 
a book from the stack or tossed a clothespin on the floor. 
He was careful not to acknowledge the help with a thank 
you, in order not to encourage the toddlers to perform in 
return for praise. He found that when he clearly needed 
help, the babies                        .
① became quieter than usual
② cried to call for others’ help
③ stimulated him to show them his love
④ didn’t seem to care as much as adults
⑤ showed a keen sensitivity to his plight

않은 것은? [3점]
Common wisdom says that Internet social networking allows 
us to expand our circle of friends. However, a recent study 
says we’re as ① limited in our social contacts as we ever 
were. About twenty years ago, the British anthropologist, 
Robin Dunbar, observed a ②correlation between the sizes of 
primate brains and the number of social contacts. He concluded 
that humans can ③ handle regular contact with a number of 
friends somewhere between 100 and 200, and 150 became the 
standard Dunbar number for our species. Dunbar went on to 
say that this number has been ④ changeable throughout human 
history. For example, prehistoric hunter‑gatherer groups would 
split when they ⑤ surpassed 150 individuals in size, as well as 
other groupings such as academic subspecialties or working 
groups within corporations. * primate: 영장류

절한 것은?
Some linguists thought that some “primitive” languages 
were intermediate between animal languages and civilized 
ones. They (A) adopted / abandoned  this idea when they 
discovered that grammatical rules varied in complexity 
independently of social development. An American Indian 
l a n g u a g e ,   for example, has twice as many case endings as Latin. Other proposed characteristics of “primitive” languages, 
such as the (B) abuse / absence  of appropriately general 
words, proved to be unreliable indicators of evolutionary 
grades. The Agta of the Philippines have thirty‑one different 
verbs that refer to particular types of fishing. Yet they lack 
a generic word meaning “to fish.” In fact, they have no need 
to refer to fishing as a general activity for their living. 
Linguists realize that the failure of a language to have a 
general word is (C) relevant / irrelevant  to its evolutionary 
standing. * case ending: 격 변화 어미
(A) (B) (C)
① adopted  abuse  relevant
② adopted  absence  relevant
③ abandoned  absence  irrelevant
④ abandoned  absence  relevant
⑤ abandoned  abuse  irrelevant

31. How can people make their purchasing decisions in a way 
that will maximize their long‑term happiness? Although most 
people would think about how nice it would be to decorate 
their apartment quickly, it should be clear that given the 
human tendency for adaptation, they would actually be happier 
if they limited their purchases and took breaks. The lesson 
here is to (A)  pleasure. A new couch may please you 
for a couple of months, so don’t buy your new television until 
after the thrill of the couch has worn off. The opposite holds 
true if you are struggling with economic cutbacks. When 
reducing consumption, you should move to a smaller 
apartment, give up cable television, and cut back on expensive 
coffee (B) . Sure, the initial pain will be larger, but the 
total amount of agony over time will be lower. [3점]

① share  at intervals
② share  all at once
③ hide  all at once
④ slow down  all at once
⑤ slow down  at intervals
32. If you establish an adequate baseline by observing a 
specific individual’s arm behaviors over a period of time, 
you can detect how he is feeling by his arm movements.  
(A)   , arm movements can let you know how someone is 
feeling upon returning home from work. When a person feels 
discouraged or sad after a tough day, his arms will be low at 
his side, shoulders drooping. Armed with this understanding, 
you can comfort the person and help him recover from a hard 
day. (B) , watch people being reunited after a long 
absence. They hold their open arms straight out. The meaning 
is clear, “Come here, I want to hold you!” Our arms reach 
out, defying gravity and opening up our entire body, because 
our feelings are so genuinely positive.

① For instance  Therefore
② For instance  In contrast
③ In addition  Therefore

33. 다음 글에 드러난 Shay의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
Shay and his father were walking past a park where some 
boys Shay knew were playing baseball. “Do you think they’ll 
let me play?” Shay anxiously asked his father although he 
knew they wouldn’t let him join them because of his 
handicap. How many times had he been denied playing in a 
game since he hurt his leg severely three years ago? Shay’s 
father looked at his son, overwhelmed with pity. He 
approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay 
could play, not expecting much. The boy looked at Shay and 
said, “We’re losing by six runs, and the game is in the eighth 
inning. I guess he can be on our team, and we’ll try to put 
him in to bat in the ninth inning.” Shay struggled over to the 
team’s bench and put on a team shirt with a broad smile on 
his face and tears in his eyes.
① worried → sad ② longing → delighted
③ doubtful → frustrated ④ sympathetic → moved

34. I once visited a ski resort while our company was producing 
one of our first televised ski races. Upon arriving, I 
immediately looked for the head of our television division who 
was overseeing the event. To my surprise, I was told he was 
out on the side of the mountain setting up camera angles with 
the crew. That would have been an acceptable place for him 
to be if he had still been a producer. But as a division head, I 
expected him to be at the base of the mountain, directing the 
event on the whole. Because he hadn’t grasped his new 
position, this executive went back to the old, comfortable 
position without realizing that his new position required him to 
sacrifice some of his old ways.

② Endeavor to Get to the Top
③ History: The Window to the Future
④ Embrace the Present with Open Arms
⑤ Farewell to the Past for a New Move
35. When we start designing something, we sketch out ideas 
with a big, thick marker, instead of a ball‑point pen. Why? 
Pen points are too fine. They encourage you to worry about 
things that you shouldn’t worry about yet, like perfecting the 
shading or whether to use a dotted or dashed line. You end 
up focusing on things that should still be out of focus. A 
marker makes it impossible to drill down that deep. You can 
only draw shapes, lines, and boxes. That’s good. The big 
picture is all you should be worrying about in the beginning. 
You need to approach your idea in the same way. Getting 
obsessed with details too early leads to disagreement, 
meetings, and delays. You get lost in things that don’t really 
matter. You waste your time on decisions that are going to 
change anyway.
① Ignore Details Early On
② Don’t Leave It to Chance
③ Loud Action, Little Success
④ What Can You Gain from Loss?
⑤ Shape Your Dream on Your Own

The above graph shows the employment rates of landed 
immigrants and Canadian‑born people in Canada in 2010. ①The 
full‑time employment rate was higher than the part‑time 
employment rate for both landed immigrants and Canadian‑born

employment rate than Canadian‑born people in both categories.

37. Andrea McNichol에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Andrea McNichol works as a handwriting analyst now, but 
she was not good at handwriting in school. Her mother was 
always yelling at her about her handwriting. It never got 
hung on the walls like the other kids’. It was messy, ugly, 
and nothing like her mother’s — she used to win penmanship 
awards for hers. Andrea was an embarrassment to her 
mother. Now, some twenty years after graduating from 
college, she is on the witness stand in L.A. Superior Court, 
and the examining attorney is asking her, “Would you state 
your profession for the record, Ms. McNichol?” She responds, 
“I am a graphologist.” Yes, as ironic as it may sound, she 
now makes a living by using her knowledge of handwriting. 
She specializes in personality assessment via handwriting, and 
in authenticating handwriting on questioned documents.

38. Heliotrop에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Heliotrop was built in 1994 by a German architect Rolf 
Disch for his home in Freigur, Germany. The most important 
characteristic of this house is its low energy consumption 
due to its ability to rotate according to the sun’s position as 
well as its solar energy production thanks to roof‑mounted 
solar panels. The cylindrical building is designed to face the 
sun with its triple‑pane windows during the cold months of 
the year and turn its highly insulated backside to the sun 
during the warmer months when heating isn’t necessary. As 
the house is exposed to the sun with the open front’s 
special windows, the maximum possible energy and light is 
let into it. Solar panels on its roof also rotate independently 
of the building to follow the sun. * insulate: 단열하다

39. Early human beings had to be good at exploring their 
surroundings and maintaining an intimate memory of edible and 
inedible plants, insects, and small animals, and the seasonal 
changes that conditioned their own hand‑to‑mouth survival. 
Primitive people were constantly observing the behavior of other 
animals and mimicking their behavior as if to incorporate it into 
the making of their own. Early man may have learned trapping 
from the spider, basket‑making from the birds’ nests, burrowing 
from rabbits, and the art of using poison from snakes. Unlike 
most species, man did not hesitate to learn from other creatures 
and copy their ways; by imitating their diets and methods of 
getting food he multiplied his own chances of survival.

40. During busy times of the year, such as the Christmas holiday 
season, it’s easy to become preoccupied with the stresses of 
everyday life. The last thing on your mind might be what you’ll 
be doing in a couple of months, years, or decades. However, in 
one study of first‑semester college students, researchers found 
that those students who focused on their futures were more 
engaged in their academic pursuits. Although there is perhaps 
no period in life quite as stressful as the first year of college, 
students could be more engaged in what they were doing when 
they saw the big picture and avoided being weighed down by 
the strains of their present circumstances. Researchers believe 
that people who can project themselves into the future can get 
the most out of their lives right now because they see where 
it’s leading them.

41. Stories have long been used as instruments of persuasion. 
Aesop used his fables to lead people toward a certain moral 
code. The persuasive power of stories certainly hasn’t been lost 
on advertisers. A vast number of TV commercials, for example, 
pack miniature stories into the briefest of clips. The reason 
why these fictional words and actions can powerfully impact our 
attitudes and behavior is that fiction doesn’t feel persuasive. 
Even when it’s been created with that goal, it’s easy to lose 
sight of its original purpose and simply sink into the experience 
of being entertained. Many people automatically activate a 
defensive system when they detect that a message has 
persuasive intent. Miniature fiction is probably one of the best 
ways to mask the true persuasive nature of advertising.
① establishing moral codes through stories
② why using fiction is effective in advertising
③ how to incorporate personal experiences in advertising

which keep it waterproof and warm in the icy waters. Crude 
oil from a spill destroys these natural oils, and the penguin 
fails to protect itself from the cold. The bird is also liable 
to swallow poisonous oil and die since it preens its feathers 
using its beak. Sweaters are often used to keep penguins 
warm when they have just been rescued from an oil slick. 
Once penguins are rescued, they are cleaned, dressed in 
sweaters, and then put in salt‑water pools for rehabilitation. 
As they swim around and regain their strength, the salt 
water gradually destroys the wool. By the time the penguins 
are ready to return to the ocean, their natural oils will have 
come back, and they can go home dressed only in their 
feathers. * preen: (부리로) 다듬다
① the functions of penguins’ natural oils
② the value of protecting penguins’ habitat
③ dangers penguins face in polluted waters
④ the impact of oil spills on the environment
⑤ a rehabilitation process of rescued penguins

The settlement of the Latin American countryside took 
a different course from that of North America. The Latin 
Americans did not settle on individual family farms.
(A) The poorer people worked on these estates for low 
wages. They had little hope of ever owning their own 
land. The landowners also forced the native Indians to 
work on the haciendas and later imported millions of 
African slaves for the same purpose.
(B) That’s because the government did not promote private 
ownership of land. Wealthy men owned most of the 
land, from which they made huge estates, called 
haciendas.
(C) Many of the owners, however, cared little for developing 
their land or using it wisely. Their attitude kept the 
workers in poverty and the land undeveloped, and led 
many Latin American nations to remain agricultural.

People themselves also differ in their ability to taste and 
in their tolerance of certain plants.
We know that the taste of a particular plant from one place 
may differ slightly from that of the same plant at another 
place. ( ① ) This is due to genetic variation usually 
manifested in differing characteristics. ( ② ) Thus, the degree 
of bitterness or mildness in many members of the mustard 
and daisy families can be attributed to natural genetic 
variations. ( ③ ) Chemical composition of the soil along with 
other substances added by man or animals can affect the taste 
of some plants, especially smaller herbs. ( ④ ) While some 
people enjoy dandelion leaves, others may hate them. ( ⑤ ) 
You might acquire a taste for certain edible plants only after 
experimenting with harvest and preparation techniques.

Sandra Lee, who is famous for her Semi‑Homemade, 
understands the delicate balance between the desire to 
feel the pride of ownership and the wish not to spend 
too much time in the kitchen. According to Lee, 
housewives can feel the joy of creation while saving 
time by using ready‑made products for seventy percent 
of the process (cake mix, store‑bought minced garlic, a 
jar of marinara sauce) and thirty percent “fresh, creative 
touches” (a bit of honey and vanilla in the cake mix, or 
fresh eggs and vegetables instead of dried ones). 
Housewives can combine off‑the‑shelf products with just 
the right amount of personalization. Lee’s TV show, 
magazine, and numerous cookbooks offer evidence that a 
spoonful of ownership is a crucial ingredient in the 
psychological exercise that is cooking.

By combining labor‑saving help and   (A)  , housewives

While I was staying at a world‑renowned hotel in 
Bogota, Colombia, the general manager commented to me 
that he had recently hired some new hotel guards, and 
although he couldn’t put his finger on it, there was 
something about them he didn’t like. He knew that I had 
worked in law enforcement for the FBI, and he asked 
whether I had noticed anything bothersome about his 
new staff members. We walked outside where the guards 
were posted and took a quick glance. The manager noted 
that although they had new uniforms and their boots 
were shined, something wasn’t right. I agreed that the 
uniforms looked professional, but pointed out that the 
guards were standing with their thumbs in their pockets, 
making them look weak and incompetent.
At first the manager didn’t seem to grasp what I was 
saying until I had him demonstrate the posture himself. 
Immediately he said, “You are right. They look like little 
kids waiting for their mother to tell them what to eat and 
what to wear.” The next day the guards were shown how 
to stand and look authoritative (hands behind back, chin 
up) without looking threatening to the guests. Sometimes 
little things mean a lot. In this case, the disappearing 
thumbs became indicators which showed                 
— not exactly what you want from a security force, 
especially in Bogota, Colombia.

(A)
Michael Swenson loved to swim. In fact, every night 
after school he would go to the community pool and swim 
lap after lap just for pure enjoyment. One day (a)he saw 
an ad announcing a local swimming meet in a newspaper. 
Michael entered and continued to practice. It was a 
ten‑mile race across a lake. With only four weeks to 
prepare, Michael intensified his workouts.
(B)
Then something interesting happened. All the 
spectators congratulated the winner for his excellence 
but immediately turned their attention to Michael. A lady 
passing by who didn’t see the race was confused. She 
tapped a man on the shoulder and asked, “Why are they 
making such a big deal of this guy? He didn’t win!” The 
man turned to her and replied, “Because Michael would 
have easily won had (b)he had two arms!”
(C)
Race day finally came, and to Michael’s astonishment, 
hundreds of contestants had entered. On top of this 
pressure, thousands of people showed up to cheer for their 
favorite contenders. The swimmers were lined up, and the 
gun went off to start the race. Michael’s preparation and 
hard work paid off. At the five‑mile mark (c)he had a 
commanding lead. But then fatigue struck. Negative thoughts 
began flooding Michael’s head. I can’t make it. I’ll quit now.
(D)
As Michael slowed down, the second‑place swimmer started 
to make his move. (d)He swam to within one hundred yards 
of Michael. But Michael fought back. He was able to put the 
negative thoughts aside and push himself to greatness. (e)He 
decided that he wanted this victory, this glory. At the 
nine‑mile mark, the second‑place swimmer was now only 
thirty yards behind him. Michael knew it and pushed himself 
even harder. With only five yards to go, the second‑place 
contestant passed Michael and won the race. Both swimmers 
collapsed and lay in the sand gasping for breath.
