41. Stories have long been used as instruments of persuasion. 
Aesop used his fables to lead people toward a certain moral 
code. The persuasive power of stories certainly hasn’t been lost 
on advertisers. A vast number of TV commercials, for example, 
pack miniature stories into the briefest of clips. The reason 
why these fictional words and actions can powerfully impact our 
attitudes and behavior is that fiction doesn’t feel persuasive. 
Even when it’s been created with that goal, it’s easy to lose 
sight of its original purpose and simply sink into the experience 
of being entertained. Many people automatically activate a 
defensive system when they detect that a message has 
persuasive intent. Miniature fiction is probably one of the best 
ways to mask the true persuasive nature of advertising.
