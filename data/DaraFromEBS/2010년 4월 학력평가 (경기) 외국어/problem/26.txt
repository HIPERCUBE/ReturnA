Did you read the first line as a set of letters? Did you read the 
second line as a set of numbers? Look closely now at the letter 
B and the number 13. The actual marks on the paper are the 
same. What accounts for the fact that most people read letters 
in the first line and numbers in the second? If you say it has

you are correct. What words or sentences mean has a lot to do 
with what goes before or after them. We often think that 
meaning comes from the marks on the page, but meaning also 
has a lot to do with what is in our heads. We see what we 
expect to see.
