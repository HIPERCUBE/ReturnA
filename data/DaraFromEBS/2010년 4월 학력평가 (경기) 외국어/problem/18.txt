18. 밑줄 친 It[it]이 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
It’s not always easy to tell what’s it and what’s not. 
Sometimes, it’s accidental — you really intended to do your own 
work, but instead ended up with some sentences that sound just 
like something you’ve read. It is a shortcut that enables you to 
save time for thinking about any subject, gathering your own 
thoughts about it. Cut, paste, and you’re done. It comes from a 
Latin word for kidnapping. You know that kidnapping is stealing 
a person. You wouldn’t take someone’s lunch money or bike, 
right? Well, someone’s words and thoughts are personal 
property, too. Ask yourself, “Would I know this if I hadn’t read 
it on that website or in that book?” If the answer is no, list the 
original source.
