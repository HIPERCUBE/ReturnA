Can you guess why the picture above is titled “How Can This 
B e     T  r u e  ? ”  Look at Figure 1. It is made up of four separable 
pieces. More specifically, it consists of two ① triangles and two 
polygons which look like the letter “L”. These L-like fragments 
are combined into a rectangle. The four parts have ② different 
sizes respectively. Especially, the triangle at the left side of the 
rectangle is ③ smaller than the one on the top of the rectangle. 
Now, look at Figure 2. You move and ④ rearrange the four 
fragments from Figure 1 without adding new pieces or pulling 
out the original ones. The result? Strange enough, there is a 
small ⑤ square hole at the bottom of the newly-born figure. 
How can this be true?
