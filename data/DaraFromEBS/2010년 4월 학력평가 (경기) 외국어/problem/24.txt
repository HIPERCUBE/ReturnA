24.  One difference between winners and losers is their                
toward the problems. Achievers never see a 
problem as being overwhelming. That is, they don’t think one 
problem controls their whole life. They always see it as, “Well, 
it’s just a little challenge with my eating pattern.” They don’t 
see it as, “I’m the problem. Because I overeat, my whole life is 
destroyed.” Conversely, failures have developed a belief that 
because they ruined in one area, they lost everything! They 
believe that because they have financial challenges, their whole 
life is now destroyed: their kids won’t be taken care of, their 
spouses will leave them, and so on. Pretty soon they generalize 
that things are out of control and feel completely helpless.
