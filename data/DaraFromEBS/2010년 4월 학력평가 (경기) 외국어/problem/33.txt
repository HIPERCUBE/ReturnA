33.  We are constantly bombarded with celebrities telling us 
which credit card to use, what coffee to drink, or which politician 
to support. Using celebrities’ opinions may not be logical. Often 
the “expert” or “authority” speaks out on a topic that is unrelated 
to his or her own field. Suppose the Minister of Health and 
Welfare warns that smoking is harmful and may cause cancer. 
Though he is not a doctor, his warning seemingly sounds 
perfect. The fact that he is Minister of Health and Welfare may 
qualify him as an expert in the health field. But even in cases 
where the experts are qualified, they often disagree. Hence, the 
common advice is to seek “a second opinion.” Depending on 
authority makes sense only when the experts all agree.
① qualification of reliable specialists
② error in relying on authority’s opinion
③ misjudgement from obsession with health
④ consideration about consulting an amateur
⑤ effective persuasion assisted by professionals
