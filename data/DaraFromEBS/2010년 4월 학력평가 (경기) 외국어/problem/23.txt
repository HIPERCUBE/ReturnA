Every adult should engage in half an hour of moderate physical 
activity at least five days per week to remain active and healthy, 
according to national health guidelines. ① However, about half 
the Australian population is not achieving this and, as a result, 
has increased the nation’s risk of cardiovascular diseases, 
diabetes and obesity. ② According to an Australian institute 
specializing in the heart and diabetes, regular physical exercise 
such as riding a bike may be an answer. ③ A director of the 
institute says bike riding is the sensible choice to improve health 
for those not normally accustomed to training. ④ Studies also 
show that safety has been improved for both motorists and 
cyclists when bike lanes exist. ⑤ Bike riding appeals to a large 
number of people because it is affordable and can be a stepping 
stone for fitness.
