22. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Not long ago I heard about a man who ① found $35,000 in a 
bag on the street. He instantly sought out and returned ② it to 
the owner. Everyone who heard the story wanted to congratulate 
this man, but he shied away from the media and avoided being 
filmed. He firmly insisted that returning the money ③ was the 
right and only thing he could do. It turned out that this money 
was the life savings of an old woman, and through his one act he 
probably saved her financial life, yet he refused ④ to receive 
praise. Why? Clearly the experiences of his past had helped him 
to develop a belief: receiving praise for doing ⑤ that obviously 
was the right thing would be totally inappropriate.
