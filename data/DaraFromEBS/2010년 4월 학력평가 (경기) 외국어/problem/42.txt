42.  Many people are trapped in their painful emotions instead of 
trying to overcome them. Rather than learn the positive message 
their painful emotions are trying to give them, they make them 
even worse. Moreover, people compete with others over how 
much painful emotions they have suffered. For example, they 
say, “Do you think you have a hard time out of painful 
experiences? Let me tell you how terrible my suffering is!” 
They just pride themselves on experiencing worse painful 
emotions than anyone else. As you can imagine, this is one of 
the deadliest traps of all, which should be avoided at all costs.
