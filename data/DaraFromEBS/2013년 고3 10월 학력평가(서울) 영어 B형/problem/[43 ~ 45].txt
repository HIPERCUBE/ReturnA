(A)
Tina Larson was seventeen years old and always wore 
a bright smile. This may not seem unusual ― but she was 
born with cerebral palsy, a condition that left her 
muscles stiff and unmanageable. Because (a) she had 
trouble speaking, this bright smile was the true reflection 
of her personality. She used a walker most of the time 
at school. A lot of people didn’t speak to her. Maybe it’s 
because she looked different, and the other students 
didn’t know how to approach her. Tina usually broke the 
ice with people she met in the halls with a big “Hi!”
* cerebral palsy: 뇌성마비
(B)
When she finished, a fellow student said, “Tina, why 
did you do that? (b) She was just kidding and it’s only 
worth ten points.” Tina took her time forming the words, 
“Because I want to be like you guys ― normal.” Silence 
fell on the whole room, until another student exclaimed, 
“Tina, we’re not normal ― we’re teenagers! We get in 
trouble all the time!” “I know,” Tina said, and a big 
smile spread across her face. Tina got her ten points 
that day. She also got the love and respect of her 
classmates, and to (c) her that was worth a lot more.

One day, I gave my students an assignment that they 
should memorize three stanzas of a poem. I made the 
assignment worth only ten points, because I figured most 
of my students wouldn’t do it. Tina was in the class, 
and I saw (d) her normal bright smile change to a look 
of worry. The day when the assignment was due came 
and my expectations were met as one by one each 
student failed to recite the poem. “Sorry, Mrs. Krause,” 
was the standard reply. Finally, in frustration and half 
kidding, I proclaimed that the next person who didn’t 
recite the poem perfectly had to drop to the floor and 
give me ten push­ups.

(D)
To my surprise, the next student was Tina. Using her 
walker, Tina moved to the front of the class and, 
straining to form the words, began to recite the poem. 
(e) She made it to the end of the first stanza ― and 
made a mistake. Before I could say a word, she threw 
her walker to the side, dropped to the floor, and started 
doing push­ups. I was horrified. But she stood in front of 
the class, and began again. This time she finished all 
three stanzas perfectly.
