34. Horseshoe crabs have copper in their blood that makes the 
blood turn royal blue in the air. The odd­colored blood has 
an amazing trait. It detects bacteria (germs) and forms a 
clot. In the 1960s, scientists invented a test using horseshoe 
blood to detect endotoxins, the chemical poisons some 
bacteria make, in human medicines. Just a tiny amount of 
endotoxins in a person’s bloodstream can cause dangerous 
fevers and even death. To test if a drug is clean of bacteria 
or endotoxins, the drug is mixed with an extract from 
horseshoe blood, called Limulus lysate. If a jellylike clot 
forms, the drug is not safe. The Limulus lysate test is quick 
and can detect even the tiniest amount of endotoxins. It is 
used worldwide to check if medicines, blood donations, and 
medical supplies are clean and safe. Every year, the 
extraordinary blue bloods                         .
