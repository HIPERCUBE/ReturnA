Camping for pleasure is not a direct descendant of 
nomadic culture. It emerged in the nineteenth century in 
response to a variety of social forces. First, the Romantic 
movement encouraged communing with the beauties of 
nature, while also glorifying the life of the lone outsider 
who rebelled against organized society. According to the 
historians of camping, Colin Ward and Dennis Hardy, 
works like Friedrich Schiller’s The Robbers and George 
Borrow’s nineteenth­century gypsy tales           the 
gypsy camp whose carefree occupants lived a simple, 
heroic life under the stars, contemptuous of settled town 
dwellers in their dull comfort. A second influence was 
the age of empire. European powers in Africa and Asia 
were busy trekking into the dark wilderness, pitching 
their bell tents and erecting barrack huts as they 
attempted to extend their control over indigenous lands. 
Camping was necessary for colonial expansion, and 
became a way of life not only for the troops, but for the 
explorers and missionaries. A final factor was the rise of 
emigration. Hundreds of thousands fled Europe in the 
nineteenth century to create new lives in Australia, the 
United States, Canada and South Africa, working as 
trappers, lumberjacks and ranchers, or lured by the gold 
rushes. A specialist industry grew up to supply their 
needs ― tents, camp beds, stoves, kettles, camp matches 
and coffee. Their tales of rough adventure were soon 
popularized in the press back home. Camping was 
becoming part of the cultural imagination.
