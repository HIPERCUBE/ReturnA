Online we can hang out in chat rooms with like­minded 
souls and join social networks that reflect our beliefs 
and interests, and even read news blogs that reflect our 
individual ideologies and views of the world. Groups are 
now formed less on shared activities and more on shared 
ideologies. We first identify our own values and 
preferences and then seek out communities that reflect 
those perspectives and inclinations. This shift that 
started online has spilled over into retail and business. It 
has changed the game in how successful products and 
services are marketed. Our collective mind­set has 
changed, and mass marketing no longer works. Now the 
way to get mass support is by microtargeting groups 
with strong kinship relevancy. Smaller “tribes,” where 
members have the same or almost identical mind­set and 
a strong sense of kinship, have the power to create 
global success for a product.
