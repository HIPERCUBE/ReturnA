31. The person who relates to certain individuals as family 
members or friends to the exclusion of others does not affirm 
that those to whom he relates are better persons. He affirms 
only that they are his relatives or friends. When a new father

girl in town,” he is not informing the infant that she would 
win a beauty contest of girls of her age before a fair panel of

his little girl. The same is true in general when people assert 
that their spouses, their parents, and their sons and daughters 
are “the best.” The highest praises are used to indicate that 
certain persons                                      .
