27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
I hope you remember our discussion last Monday about the 
servicing of the washing machine ① supplied to us three 
months ago. I regret to say the machine is no longer working. As 
we agreed during the meeting, please send a service engineer as 
soon as possible to repair it. The product warranty says ② that 
you provide spare parts and materials for free, but charge for the 
engineer’s labor. This sounds ③ unfair. I believe the machine’s 
failure is caused by a manufacturing defect. Initially, it made a 
lot of noise, and later, it stopped ④ to operate entirely. As it is 
wholly the company’s responsibility to correct the defect, I 
hope you will not make us ⑤ pay for the labor component of its 
repair.
