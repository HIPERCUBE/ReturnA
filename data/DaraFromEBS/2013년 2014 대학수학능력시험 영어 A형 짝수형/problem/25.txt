Some people punish themselves when they are under time 
pressure. They delete all the games on their PC, they stop 
going for walks, and they don’t spend time with their friends. 
They then have less pleasure in life and less balance― and 
their work performance actually declines. Break out of this 
pattern by paying more attention to relaxation and getting 
more involved in living when you are under pressure. Define 
clear time periods for this: half an hour for a walk, ten 
minutes to play a game on your PC, and so on. Your mind will 
become more creative during the break, and you will become 
mentally fitter. Free time without feelings of guilt will give 
you the strength to do high-quality work in the remaining 
time. Furthermore, a certain amount of recreation reduces the 
chances of developing stress-related disorders.
