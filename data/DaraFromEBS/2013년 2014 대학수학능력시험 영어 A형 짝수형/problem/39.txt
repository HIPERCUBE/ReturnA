When Tom had helped the blind man to cross the street, he 
realized he had left his book bag on the bus stop bench.
As Tom was waiting for a bus, he noticed a blind man 
trying to cross the street. ( ① ) The traffic was heavy, and it 
was likely the blind man would get hit, as he was not crossing 
at a crosswalk. ( ② ) Tom looked around and saw there was 
no one else to help, so he asked the blind man if he would like 
help crossing the street. ( ③ ) The blind man readily said 
yes, then latched onto Tom’s arm, and they began their walk 
across the street avoiding speeding cars. ( ④ ) When Tom 
looked back at the bus stop bench, he saw another man sitting 
next to his book bag. ( ⑤ ) And when Tom got to the bus 
stop bench, the man said, “I saw what you were doing, so I 
decided to sit here and watch your book bag.”
