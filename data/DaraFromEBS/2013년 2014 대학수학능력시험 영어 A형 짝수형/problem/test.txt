one in an oxygen-inflated plastic bag with enough 
water to keep the fish relaxed and comfortable. 
Furthermore, each bag is wrapped in a cushion and 
then placed inside a shipping box. Your fish will 
enjoy the journey all the way to your customers’ front 
doors. Call us at 1-800-456-4959 or e-mail us at

24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
In our efforts to be the good child, the uncomplaining 
employee, or the cooperative patient, many of us fall into the 
trap of trying to please people by going along with whatever 
they want us to do. At times, we lose track of our own 
boundaries and needs, and the cost of this could be our life, 
both symbolically and literally. When we are unable to set 
healthy limits, it causes distress in our relationships. But when 
we learn to say no to what we don’t feel like doing in order to 
say yes to our true self, we feel empowered, and our 
relationships with others improve. So don’t be afraid to say 
no. Try to catch yourself in the moment and use your true 
voice to say what you really want to say.
① 난관을 극복할 때 성취감이 생긴다.
② 항상 타인의 입장을 먼저 고려해야 한다.
③ 자신이 원하지 않는 일은 거절할 필요가 있다.
④ 자신의 의견을 고집하면 대인 관계가 악화된다.

25. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Some people punish themselves when they are under time 
pressure. They delete all the games on their PC, they stop 
going for walks, and they don’t spend time with their friends. 
They then have less pleasure in life and less balance― and 
their work performance actually declines. Break out of this 
pattern by paying more attention to relaxation and getting 
more involved in living when you are under pressure. Define 
clear time periods for this: half an hour for a walk, ten 
minutes to play a game on your PC, and so on. Your mind will 
become more creative during the break, and you will become 
mentally fitter. Free time without feelings of guilt will give 
you the strength to do high-quality work in the remaining 
time. Furthermore, a certain amount of recreation reduces the 
chances of developing stress-related disorders.
① 컴퓨터 게임 중독의 심각성
② 직장 내 대인 관계의 중요성
③ 집중력과 학습 능력 간의 관계
④ 죄책감이 정신 건강에 미치는 영향

26. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Large animals are actually less dangerous to hikers than 
smaller ones. Common sense tells us that we should avoid 
tigers, bears, and other large threatening animals. But smaller 
animals are actually more threatening than bigger animals. To 
overcome disadvantages of their size, small animals have 
developed useful weapons such as poison to protect 
themselves in the wild. Each year, only a few people are 
attacked by tigers or bears, and most of these incidents are 
caused by the people themselves. However, more people are 
killed by bites from small poisonous snakes than by these 
large animals. Even more people lose their lives from allergic 
reactions to common bee stings. For these reasons, hikers 
should be careful about small dangerous creatures.
① Watch Out for Small Animals!
② Animals: Human’s True Friends
③ Why Are Wild Animals Endangered?
④ Animals Attack Human Villages!

27. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
I hope you remember our discussion last Monday about the 
servicing of the washing machine ① supplied to us three 
months ago. I regret to say the machine is no longer working. As 
we agreed during the meeting, please send a service engineer as 
soon as possible to repair it. The product warranty says ② that 
you provide spare parts and materials for free, but charge for the 
engineer’s labor. This sounds ③ unfair. I believe the machine’s 
failure is caused by a manufacturing defect. Initially, it made a 
lot of noise, and later, it stopped ④ to operate entirely. As it is 
wholly the company’s responsibility to correct the defect, I 
hope you will not make us ⑤ pay for the labor component of its 
repair.

As we all know, it is not always easy to get work done at the 
office. There is (A) frequently / rarely quiet time during 
regular business hours to sit and concentrate. Office workers 
are regularly interrupted by ringing phones, impromptu 
meetings, and chattering coworkers. This can be as frustrating 
for an employee as it is for the employer who is paying for this 
nonproductive work time. Working at home can free you from 
these (B) attractions / distractions , giving you long blocks of 
time to focus on your work. Although your home may present 
its own problems, too, there are ways to deal with them. Your 
productivity will certainly (C) decrease / increase , as will the 
quality of your work product. At the same time, you will get to

getting it done.

average annual hours of seven age groups in 2007. ① In these 
groups, the volunteer rates ranged from 29% to 58%, and the 
Canadian average rate was 46%. ② The average annual hours

33. In all cultures in which eye-gaze behavior has been studied, 
science confirms that those who are dominant have more 
in using it. In essence, these individuals are 
entitled to look wherever they want. However, subordinates 
are more restricted in where they can look and when. Humility 
dictates that in the presence of royalty, as in church, heads are 
bowed. As a general rule, dominants tend to ignore 
subordinates visually while subordinates tend to gaze at 
dominant individuals at a distance. In other words, 
higher-status individuals can be indifferent while lower-status 
persons are required to be attentive with their gaze. The king 
is free to look at anyone he wants, but all subjects face the 
king, even as they back out of a room.  [3점]
* be entitled to: (～할) 권한이 있다
① anxiety ② conflict ③ freedom
④ reluctance ⑤ responsibility
34. The importance of science has led people to think that 
‘objectivity’ is the best way to see the world― to see the facts 
without any feelings. However, from a human point of view, 
objectivity is just another attitude. It is an interpretation that 
deliberately ignores our feelings. It is very useful to ensure that 
scientific measurements are taken accurately and so on, but as 
far as life is concerned, it is a bit like turning the color off on 
your TV so that you see everything in black and white and then 
saying that is more truthful. It is not more truthful; it is just a 
filter that reduces the . When 
you turn down the feelings, you also turn down the possibility 
of enjoyment.  [3점]
① criticism of scientific findings
② incorrectness of a theory
③ size of the TV screen
④ brutality of humans
⑤ richness of life
35. Sometimes all the outcomes customers are trying to achieve 
in one area have a negative effect on other outcomes. This is 
very common when companies are busy listening to the ‘voice 
of the customer.’ Traveling salespeople, for example, may say 
they want a smaller cell phone, but they may not have thought 
about how hard that tiny phone will be to use. Carpenters may 
request a lightweight circular saw without thinking about the 
fact that it will no longer have the power to get through some of 
the more difficult jobs. When customers make requests for new 
product features, they are usually focused on solving just one 
problem and are not thinking of how their requested solution 
will . 
In this situation, customers request new features but reject the 
resulting product when they realize the ramifications of their 
suggestions― the added feature turns out to be worthless 
because of the problems it causes. [3점]
* ramification: 파생된 문제
① impact other product or service functions
② delay the introduction of innovative products
③ induce other customers to make additional requests
④ bring about excessive competition among companies
⑤ discourage companies from listening to customers’ voices

Self-monitoring refers to how much people try to control 
the way they present themselves to others. Those who have 
high self-monitoring want their behavior to be socially 
acceptable. They adjust themselves to any social signal that 
indicates appropriate or inappropriate behavior. (A) , 
if they are in a meeting and see others making suggestions, 
they will try to make suggestions as well. They are also good 
at managing what others think about them. (B) , those 
who have low self-monitoring are not very sensitive to signals 
indicating socially acceptable behavior. They are not too 
concerned about behaving the right way in a specific context. 
For example, if they are in a meeting with the president of an 
organization, they may act bored. They are not deeply 
concerned about how others see them.
(A) (B)
① For example …… As a result
② For example …… In contrast
③ Otherwise …… As a result
④ Meanwhile …… In contrast
⑤ Meanwhile …… Nevertheless

You have probably heard about sending messages across 
the sea in bottles. The problem is, it is impossible to tell 
how long it will take the sea to deliver its bottled messages 
or where it will wash them up.
(A) Columbus was still more than a thousand miles from 
Europe, and he feared he would never live to tell the king 
and queen of his discovery. So he wrote the news on a 
piece of paper.
(B) In 1493, Christopher Columbus sent one of the earliest 
and most famous bottled messages. He was returning to 
Spain to tell the king and queen about what he had 
discovered, when his ship got caught in a bad storm.
(C) He put it in a wooden bottle and tossed it overboard. 
More than 300 years later, it was found by the captain of 
an American ship off the coast of Africa, near Morocco.

Life can be like riding a roller coaster. There are ups and 
downs, fast and slow parts, bumps and shaky parts, and even 
times when you’re upside down. ① You can’t control which 
way the track (or in this case, life events) will take you. 
② When you’re at the bottom, you can see only what’s right 
in front of you, but when you get to the top, you can see the 
whole picture a lot better. ③ When you’re starting out, accept 
how you feel and try to enjoy the ride. ④ When you design an 
amusement park for children, you should carefully consider 
the location of the roller coaster. ⑤ When it’s over, you’ll see 
that it was really cool― even if you couldn’t see that when 
you first started.

When Tom had helped the blind man to cross the street, he 
realized he had left his book bag on the bus stop bench.
As Tom was waiting for a bus, he noticed a blind man 
trying to cross the street. ( ① ) The traffic was heavy, and it 
was likely the blind man would get hit, as he was not crossing 
at a crosswalk. ( ② ) Tom looked around and saw there was 
no one else to help, so he asked the blind man if he would like 
help crossing the street. ( ③ ) The blind man readily said 
yes, then latched onto Tom’s arm, and they began their walk 
across the street avoiding speeding cars. ( ④ ) When Tom 
looked back at the bus stop bench, he saw another man sitting 
next to his book bag. ( ⑤ ) And when Tom got to the bus 
stop bench, the man said, “I saw what you were doing, so I 
decided to sit here and watch your book bag.”

I had volunteered for the charity picnic, and I needed to be 
there on time. Ms. Green, the charity president, was preparing 
this monthly event by herself. Lily complained, “Mom, I don’t 
feel like going today. We’ve volunteered more than five times 
this year.” She was eating slower than usual. I urged her, 
“Lily, don’t you remember we promised to help Ms. Green 
last month? Go and get dressed.” I stood by the door and 
pointed at my watch. She slowly pulled on her sweater and 
said, “I still don’t feel like going.” I started losing my 
patience. I responded, “Don’t you know Ms. Green has a lot 
of work to do for the picnic today? It’s time you started 
thinking about other people.” My voice was growing louder 
with each sentence.

It is well known that some baseball parks are better for 
hitting home runs than others. It is not just the size of the 
park that matters. Other park conditions such as wind and 
humidity also affect whether a ball sails over the fences, and 
players know this. So what happens when a player is moved 
to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home 
runs than his current one― say, 28 percent better? One 
analysis found that the player hit 60 percent more home runs. 
Why? The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal 
is. If you think you are likely to hit more home runs, you are 
more likely to swing for the fences. But if you think your 
chance of hitting a home run is smaller, your brain will send 
you signals to just try for a single to get on base.
In business and life, just as in baseball, our  
can affect whether we swing for the fences or not. The 
baseball research shows us that what matters is not the actual 
distance to the fence but what our brains recognize that 
distance to be. Consider your work and your current life. Do 
the fences seem too far away to hit a home run? Simply 
adjust the fences so that it seems easier.

[43～45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
Mom once said that my grandmother came to America as a 
poor uneducated Greek immigrant at eighteen. My 
grandmother wanted to go to school, but the harsh immigrant 
life pushed (a) her to support her family. Though she never 
learned to read in school, she knew many traditional stories 
from her home country. 

(B)
One day, when I saw my grandmother on the street by 
chance, I noticed that (b) she had difficulty in reading an 
English sign. Right at that moment, it hit upon me to teach 
her to read English in return for all she had taught me. I 
talked to my mom about it, and (c) she was delighted with 
my plan. So my grandmother and I worked hard together 
using books for beginners.
(C)
My efforts were rewarded only a month later on the 
morning of my eighteenth birthday. My grandmother 
decorated a cake with “HAPPY BIRTHDAY BETTY.” I had 
only taught her the basics of reading, but (d) she had written 
these words all by herself. Touched by this simple message, I 
said, “It’s not just my birthday, Grandma. You stepped into 
this country at eighteen. Now, you are stepping into another 
new world. So it’s your birthday, too.”
(D)
My grandmother liked to tell me these interesting stories at 
night. I still remember a few stories in which the gods made 
promises with each other like humans. Those who broke their 
promises were punished. While listening to the stories, I 
decided that I would not break any promises. The morals of 
(e) her stories taught me how I should live my life.
