Large animals are actually less dangerous to hikers than 
smaller ones. Common sense tells us that we should avoid 
tigers, bears, and other large threatening animals. But smaller 
animals are actually more threatening than bigger animals. To 
overcome disadvantages of their size, small animals have 
developed useful weapons such as poison to protect 
themselves in the wild. Each year, only a few people are 
attacked by tigers or bears, and most of these incidents are 
caused by the people themselves. However, more people are 
killed by bites from small poisonous snakes than by these 
large animals. Even more people lose their lives from allergic 
reactions to common bee stings. For these reasons, hikers 
should be careful about small dangerous creatures.
