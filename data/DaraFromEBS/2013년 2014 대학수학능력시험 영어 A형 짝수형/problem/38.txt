Life can be like riding a roller coaster. There are ups and 
downs, fast and slow parts, bumps and shaky parts, and even 
times when you’re upside down. ① You can’t control which 
way the track (or in this case, life events) will take you. 
② When you’re at the bottom, you can see only what’s right 
in front of you, but when you get to the top, you can see the 
whole picture a lot better. ③ When you’re starting out, accept 
how you feel and try to enjoy the ride. ④ When you design an 
amusement park for children, you should carefully consider 
the location of the roller coaster. ⑤ When it’s over, you’ll see 
that it was really cool― even if you couldn’t see that when 
you first started.
