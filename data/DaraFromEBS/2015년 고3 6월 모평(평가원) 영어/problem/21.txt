21. Although the Internet seems truly global these days, 
less than half of the world’s population has access to 
it. Some four billion people are still unconnected. This 
spring, IT engineers will begin to shift to the next phase 
in a grand plan to bring the Internet to everyone. Their 
goal is to establish a network of high-altitude balloons 
that will rain 4G LTE signals down to anyone with a 
4G device. Regional telecom companies will transmit the 
signals to the balloons, and then each balloon will relay 
the signals to a ground area many miles in diameter. In 
this way, farmers in remote areas will be able to access 
weather data, and rural children will be able to pursue 
online educations. By the end of the year, the engineers 
aim to have 100 balloons about 13 miles up.
