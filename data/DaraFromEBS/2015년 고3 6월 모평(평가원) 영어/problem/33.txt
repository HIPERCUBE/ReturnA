33. The audience receives a sound signal entirely through 
the vibrations generated in the air, whereas in a singer 
some of the auditory stimulus is conducted to the ear 
through the singer’s own bones. Since these two ways of 
transferring sound have quite different relative efficiencies 
at various frequencies, the overall quality of the sound 
will be quite different. You have probably experienced this 
when you have listened to your own voice, as on tape or 
through a public address system. It is easy to blame the 
‘sound of a stranger’ on ‘poor electronics,’ but this is 
only partly justified. The major effect comes from the fact 
that you hear yourself differently from the way others hear 
you. This is one of the main reasons why even the most 
accomplished singers have to listen to the opinion of 
coaches and voice teachers as to ‘how they sound,’ whereas 
no concert violinist would have to do such a thing. To the 
violinist  
to someone else standing nearby. [3점]

① the coaches are more helpful than they are
② sounds spread a lot more widely than they do
③ the audience response is just as important as it is
④ playing sounds almost exactly the same as it does
⑤ the ‘sound of a stranger’ matters more than it does
