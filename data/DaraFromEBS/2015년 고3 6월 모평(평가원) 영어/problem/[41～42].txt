It isn’t going to be easy making changes to the food 
your children eat, and even the most careful, patient 
parents will probably find that the little ones will resist 
at some point and to some degree. The problem is that 
many of us were forced to eat in a healthy way as 
children: we learned the hard way. And the temptation 
to continue with these parental habits with our own 
children is strong.
If you were made to sit at the table until you had 
cleaned your plate, you are not alone: most of the adult 
population have suffered this at some point ― at school 
if not at home. Forcing your children to eat, especially 
if they don’t like what is on the plate, is completely 
. “Sit there until you finish” may be 
how we learned, and may also be the only way you feel 
able to achieve your goal, but think about it: the 
experience of eating a pile of unwanted cabbage until 
they feel sick is hardly going to make children jump for 
joy the next time it is served. 
This strict approach is very old-fashioned, and you 
may win the battle but you definitely won’t win the 
war. Delaying puddings used to be thought of as a good 
idea too, but guess what? That doesn’t work either. “No 
pudding until you have finished your main course” was 
the standard line when most parents of today were 
young and is still commonly used, but it only makes 
sweet things seem more desirable.
