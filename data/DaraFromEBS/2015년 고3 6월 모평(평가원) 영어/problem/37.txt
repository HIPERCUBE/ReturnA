The timing of positive versus negative behavior seems 
to influence attraction. Several studies have identified  
what has been called the loss-gain effect.
(A) Studies suggest that you would not. In fact, people 
are more attracted to individuals who are consistently 
negative than to people who initially behave positively 
and then switch to negative behavior.
(B) The reason is this: people who start out being nice 
get our hopes up, so the letdown we experience 
when we discover that they are not nice makes it 
worse than if they had acted badly from the start.
(C) This effect reflects what happens to attraction when a 
person’s behavior moves from positive to negative or 
from negative to positive. For example, if someone 
seemed very nice to you early in the interaction, but 
then began to act like a fool, would you be more 
attracted to that person than if that person were a 
fool from the start?
