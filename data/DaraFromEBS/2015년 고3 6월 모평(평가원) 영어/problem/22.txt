22. Inflation can be a major life concern for most people. 
It makes it difficult for households to plan ahead. This is 
because ‘future problems’ concerning inflation often make 
us change our plans for the future. For instance, how 
much should the parents of a newborn start regularly 
saving to pay for her college education? If inflation 
averages two percent, prices roughly double every thirty-six 
years. But if inflation gets up to eight percent, prices 
roughly double every nine years. A Harvard education 
that currently costs $100,000 may therefore end up costing 
half a million dollars for an infant born today. Millions 
of workers who retired with pensions during the 1960s 
and 1970s found that inflation pushed up costs far beyond 
their expected expenses. Many had to reenter the workforce 
just to make ends meet.
