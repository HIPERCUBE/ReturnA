31. In an increasingly globalized world, literature in 
translation has an especially important role. Increasingly, 
writers, readers, and publishers are turning to literature as 
a bridge between cultures, particularly Western and Arab 
societies. This growing interest is, in turn, driving a 
boom in translation. However, not surprisingly perhaps, 
most translations are from English into other languages, 
not from another language, such as Arabic, into English. 
Hence, the huge American market is seen as driving the  
. Bookstores in the United States, for example, 
rarely stock more than Nobel Prize winner Naguib 
Mahfouz’s Cairo Trilogy, a masterful, realistic account of 
life in Cairo and of a merchant family in the mid-20th 
century. Western readers likely know little of Mahfouz’s 
more experimental work, his political and religious 
allegories, or his historical dramas. The result is a kind 
of one-way mirror between America and the rest of the 
world. [3점]
