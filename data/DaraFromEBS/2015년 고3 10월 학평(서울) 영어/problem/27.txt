Grandma put her things down on the sand and walked over 
to Phoebe on the shore by the water. Schools of minnows 
were everywhere in the crystal clear water. Phoebe was 
going crazy watching the minnows. ① She said, “Grandma, I 
want to catch a fish.” When ② she handed Phoebe the very 
small net, Phoebe immediately tried to scoop up the 
minnows. It took Phoebe less than ten minutes, and even 
that was too long, for Phoebe to catch ③ her first minnow. 
After many frustrating attempts, ④ she finally screeched 
with joy and ran to Grandma sitting on her beach towel. 
“Grandma, look, I caught a fish!” Phoebe gave the minnow to 
Grandma, which she kept for Phoebe in a clear, plastic 
container as a souvenir of Phoebe catching ⑤ her first fish.
