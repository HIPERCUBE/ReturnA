Parents are commonly reluctant to grant their grown 
children equal footing with them as adults. This delay can 
persist into later life, especially if geographic distance 
prevents parents from witnessing their children’s success in 
jobs or relationships. ① More decisively than most life 
experiences, illness can cause a change in such a 
relationship by forcing parents to accept help from their 
children. ② A father who decides to rely on his son to do 
his banking, for example, implicitly affirms his son’s 
capabilities as an adult. ③ Such reliance conveys a trust that 
may be deeply satisfying to the son. ④ Parents encourage 
creative activities in the child and participate with him in 
such activities. ⑤ By allowing his son to be a provider of 
help, the father actually gives emotionally more than he 
receives practically.
