31. Dependency never goes away; it just becomes more subtle 
and systemic. Without someone to feed us, change our 
diapers, or carry us from place to place, we would never 
survive to grow up. Later, all these forms of help fade into 
the background. They no longer look like mommy and daddy 
putting the spoon in our mouths. They look like the 
supermarket, the restaurant, the sewer system, the electrical 
grid, running water, and the emergency room. Help becomes 
pervasive and invisible, but it’s still there. For every one 
thing we think we have done on our own, there are a dozen 
things that had to be provided for us by others. We live in 
a dense fabric of mutual aid. That’s what makes us a social 
species. Even when we go out to compete in the world for 
money and praise, we never achieve on our own. We build 
upon parents, relatives, friends, teachers, and neighbors who 
helped along the way. __________________________________.
