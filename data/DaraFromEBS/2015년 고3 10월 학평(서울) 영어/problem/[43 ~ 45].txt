(A)
In the winter of 1995, the weather was so cold that 
over four inches of ice formed on a small lake in 
Indiana, making it safe to walk on. However, a few 
warm days in February melted some of the ice, making 
it dangerous to walk on. Unfortunately, 12­year­old Josh 
Mitchell didn’t realize that, and he decided to take a 
shortcut to a friend’s house by walking across the 
semi­frozen lake. He fell through the ice, and a dog 
named Levi, the pet of Denise and George Hammond, 
saw (a) him and started whining.
(B)
Denise fainted when she reached the shore, but 
paramedics took care of her and Josh and took them to 
the hospital, where they quickly recovered. Of course, 
Josh and (b) his parents were grateful to Levi and the 
Hammonds, and they sent them gifts: bones for Levi, a 
big bouquet of flowers for Denise, and a gift certificate 
to be used at a pet store.

(C)
Denise kept breaking the ice until she could reach 
Josh, then she kept (c) him afloat. George called Levi, 
and Levi came out of the water. Two neighbors brought 
an extension ladder out to the lake and pushed it to 
where Denise and Josh were. Denise pushed (d) him up 
on the ladder and then climbed up on the ladder herself. 
The ladder distributed their weight across a large area 
of the ice so that they didn’t fall through, and they 
reached the shore.
(D)
George saw Josh floundering in the icy water. (e) He 
ordered, “Levi, fetch!” Levi ran out onto the lake, 
jumped into the water, and allowed Josh to hold on to 
him. Meanwhile, George and Denise brought Levi’s 
20­foot leash out to the lake and tried to throw it to 
Josh, but the leash was too short. Because she didn’t 
know how long Levi could keep Josh afloat, Denise went 
out on the ice, knowing that although she weighed less 
than her husband, she would probably fall through the 
ice. In fact, she did fall through the ice four feet away 
from Josh.
