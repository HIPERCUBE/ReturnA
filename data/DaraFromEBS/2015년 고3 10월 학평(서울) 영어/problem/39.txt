Some of the same essential oil properties that serve 
plants in nature also provide health benefits to humans.
The essential oil, it has been said, is the heart and soul 
of a plant. ( ① ) It gives a plant its scent and may also 
drive away insects, attract bees and wasps for fertilization 
of the plant’s flowers, and protect the plant against decay, 
bacteria, and mold. ( ② ) Food manufacturers, for example, 
sometimes include essential oils in their products as a way 
of preventing bacterial growth. ( ③ ) The oils are purer and 
more healthful than chemical antibacterial agents, such as 
chlorine. ( ④ ) Many skincare products also make use of 
antibacterial essential oils. ( ⑤ ) In nature, these oils 
protect plants against bacteria, and they do the same for us 
when rubbed on the skin.
