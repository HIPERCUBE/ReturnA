The human species and human culture evolved through 
interaction with the entire communities of animals and 
plants. Of the two great influences that make humans what 
they are, heredity and environment, environment is 
undoubtedly the more powerful. After all, heredity itself 
encodes the results of millions of years of environmental 
influences on the human genome. Even genetic mutations 
are, to some extent, caused by environmental factors. 
Evolution is largely the result of natural selection that takes 
place because humans, during their history of development 
as a species, have been part of biotic communities in which 
their interactions with other species of animals and plants 
have decided whether or not they survived and reproduced.
