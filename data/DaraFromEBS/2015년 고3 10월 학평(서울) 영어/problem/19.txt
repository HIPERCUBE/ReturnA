We all enjoy the pleasure of being left alone with a good 
book. But sometimes after several hours of immersion we 
lift our heads and look around, suddenly struck by the quiet, 
the absence of others. In this situation, we are suffering 
from reading­induced loneliness. The solution is to read in 
the company of other people who are reading — whether in a 
public space such as a café or a library, or in your own 
home, with your reading friend or partner at the other end 
of the sofa. Next time you look up, you’ll see someone else 
similarly immersed, and you won’t feel alone at all. Reading 
can be sociable. Consider joining a reading group in which 
everybody takes turns reading aloud from a novel. Reading a 
book collaboratively is a wonderful way to share an 
otherwise internal and solitary experience.
