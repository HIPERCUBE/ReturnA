Woman:
That’s right. I really like my art teacher.
You’re right. I’ll talk to her right now.
I don’t like people who are late.
I’m sorry that I couldn’t help you.
I feel better because I already apologized.
Man:
I’m sure you’ll enjoy reading the book, too. 
Okay. I’m going to make a list of my own.

Hi, boys and girls!
My name is Adam Burke. Are you interested in buying 
a special lunch bag to protect our environment? 
When I was in sixth grade, I noticed that many of 
my classmates carried paper lunch bags. I found out 
that from sandwich wrappers to disposable drink 
containers, the average school kid generates 65 pounds 
of lunch bag waste every year. To help kids cut 
down on lunch bag waste, I have invented a reusable 
lunch bag, which I am now selling on my website. It 
has handles and a front pocket. And the fabric is 
partially made from recycled plastic bottles. You will 
like it because you can fold it up and put it in your 
backpack. If you’d like to buy one, please feel free 
to visit www.myblog.com/aburke.
When people expect to see someone again, they are 
more likely to find that person attractive, regardless of the 
individual’s behavior, than if they do not have expectations 
of future interaction. The expectation of future interaction 
motivates people to look for positive qualities in someone 
so that they will look forward to future interactions rather 
than dread them, and increases the chances that people 
will find the individual attractive. Conversely, when people 
interact with someone whom they do not foresee meeting 
again, they have little reason to search for positive 
qualities. In fact, doing so may be depressing, given that 
they may not have the opportunity to get to know the 
person better in future interactions. Indeed, people are 
sometimes motivated to find negative qualities in 
individuals whom they do not expect to see again.

Lone animals rely on their own senses to defend 
themselves, but an animal in a group benefits by having 
a lot of other animals’ eyes, ears, and noses on the alert 
for danger. An animal in a group also has a smaller 
chance of being the unlucky individual picked out by a 
predator. In addition, a group of animals fleeing from a 
predator can create confusion. This makes it harder for a 
predator to focus on one animal to catch. A school of 
fish will split in two to avoid a predator and then 
quickly regroup behind it. A herd of zebras can become 
a dazzling display of black and white stripes, making it 
more difficult for a lion to see where one zebra ends and 
another begins.
If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill 
a position, take a look at their writing skills. It doesn’t 
matter if that person is a marketer, salesperson, designer, 
programmer, or whatever; their writing skills will pay off. 
That’s because being a good writer is about more than 
writing. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Good 
writers know how to communicate. They make things 
easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone 
else’s shoes. They know what to omit. And those are 
qualities you want in any candidate. Writing is making a 
comeback all over our society. Look at how much 
communication happens through instant messaging and 
blogging. Writing is today’s currency for good ideas. 
Thus, it is essential to welcome people with good writing 
skills into your company.

Occasionally, there are children who have trouble 
understanding that their clothing choice is inappropriate or 
even unhealthy. Some children follow the suggestion 
that sandals may not be the best option for a snowy day. 
For those kids, experience may be the best teacher. 
For example, when Lydia was eight years old, she 
insisted on wearing her favorite sandals to school despite 
warnings that the sidewalks were covered in snow and 
slush. Her mom worried that she would arrive at 
school with cold, wet feet, but Lydia would not change 
her mind. Of course, her mother was right. While Lydia 
did have some very uncomfortable toes because they 
became soaked and frozen on her way to and from 
school, she learned that sometimes fashion isn’t worth 
the price of serious discomfort.

The above graph shows the percentage of women in wage 
employment in the non-agricultural sector in 1990 and 2006.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, women’s waged 
non-agricultural employment increased more than five 
percentage points between 1990 and 2006. In 2006, the 
percentage of women’s waged non-agricultural employment 
in East Asia and Pacific countries was twice as high as that 
of South Asia. In that same year, the percentage of 
women’s waged non-agricultural employment in the Middle 
East and North Africa was less than that of Sub-Saharan 
Africa by ten percentage points. Despite the improvement 
between 1990 and 2006, South Asia showed the smallest 
increase in the percentage of women in waged non-agricultural 
employment. Between 1990 and 2006, the increase in the 
percentage of women’s waged non-agricultural employment 
in Sub-Saharan Africa was larger than that of the Middle 
East and North Africa.

Kate ran to the mailbox as soon as the mail truck 
drove away. She opened the mailbox and reached into 
the dark space. Her hope quickly disappeared, however. 
There was nothing addressed to her. It was her sixteenth 
birthday today, but there wasn’t even a birthday card 
from her father. “I didn’t get anything from Dad,” said 
Kate to her mother. “I can’t believe he forgot my 
birthday.” Kate’s father was a doctor, and every summer 
he went to Africa to treat people who were too poor to 
go to a hospital. “Well, he didn’t forget your birthday, 
Kate. I was going to give this to you at your birthday 
party this afternoon,” said her mother, giving her a small 
pink box with a purple ribbon, which arrived from Africa 
the day before. “Yeah, I knew Dad wouldn’t let me 
down!” shouted Kate, smiling the sweetest smile.

Do you remember the childlike joy you felt the last 
time you found a parking spot at the mall on a crowded 
day? When you finished shopping, you may have left the 
spot with a certain hesitation, particularly if someone else 
was waiting for it. Studies have shown that people take 
longer to leave a parking spot when another driver is 
waiting, even though they predict they will not. It’s as if 
the space suddenly becomes more valuable once another 
person wants it. Strictly speaking, it is no longer valuable 
to the person leaving it. After all, it seems that our 
brains are so that once we have 
been given something, we are hesitant to give it up.

Wood is a material that is widely acknowledged to be 
environmentally friendly. It has been welcome as an 
alternative material for a long time in building houses 
instead of cement or bricks. However, it is not always 
easy to of one particular 
material such as wood over another. Many species of tree 
are now endangered, including mahogany and teak, and 
deforestation, particularly in tropical rainforests, has had a 
severe impact both on local communities and on native 
plants and wildlife. Where wood is harvested and then 
transported halfway across the globe, the associated energy 
costs are high, causing a negative impact on the 
environment. What is more, where wood is treated with 
chemicals to improve fire- and pest-resistance, its healthful 
properties are compromised.

Human farmers and their domesticated plants and 
animals made a grand bargain, though the farmers did not 
realize it at the time. Consider maize. Domestication made 
it dependent on man. But its association with humans also 
carried maize far beyond its origins as a little-known 
Mexican grass, so that it is now one of the most widely 
planted crops on earth. From mankind’s point of view, 
meanwhile, the domestication of maize made available an 
abundant new source of food. But its cultivation (like that 
of other plants) prompted people to adopt a new lifestyle 
based on farming. Is man taking advantage of maize for 
his own purposes, or is maize taking advantage of man? 
Domestication, it seems, is .

Pride is a sense that I am better than others, I have the 
ultimate beauty, talent, and answers, and I alone should rule 
the world. Pride causes individuals to be out of touch with 
the reality of who they truly are and of what really brings 
happiness. Pride prevents individuals from experiencing 
their true value or the true value of others. A sense of 
self-worth, (A) , provides calmness and enjoyment 
when dealing with all kinds of individuals. When individuals 
have a true sense of self-worth, they do not need to compare 
themselves with others, to tear others apart or feel superior. 
(B) , there is an experience of oneness and 
sharing. By recognizing where one’s true value lies, one 
simultaneously recognizes the true value of others.

Power walking is a type of exercise that nearly anyone can 
do. Many people enjoy this form of exercise because it 
can be done outdoors in fresh air where the scenery can be 
changed by altering the course of the walk. Alternatively, 
the exercise may be done indoors, in a climate-controlled 
environment, on a treadmill. People should start with a 
short distance on flat ground and gradually increase the 
distance and intensity. Instruct people to sit on the bench and 
to start reading their newspapers carefully. While power 
walking, people should wear shoes with a good arch support 
to avoid injury and wear clothes appropriate for the climate.

To create a unifying theme for the many crowd scenes, 
he invented a character of a backpacking tourist who 
would appear in each location.
In 1986, Martin Handford, a young British commercial 
artist who specialized in drawing cartoon scenes for 
clients, had the idea of publishing his illustrations in 
book form. ( ) His idea was to depict humorous 
crowd scenes in various locations, including a beach, a 
train station, and a country fair. ( ) In the original 
British editions of the book, the character’s name was 
Wally. ( ) He went on to publish seven more Where’s 
Wally books, create a television show, and license several 
video games. ( ) Although the fad for his character 
declined in the late 1990s, there is still occasional talk of 
a Wally movie. ( ) Wally is licensed in at least 17 
countries, where he looks pretty much the same but often 
goes by different names.

Most of the words we use and the meanings we think 
about are a combination of simpler ideas.
(A) Some of them are specialized for sitting at certain high 
places, like bar stools. If you learned about a culture 
in which a certain type of chair was used only for the 
purpose of sitting while waiting for a bus, you might 
think this is odd but would have no difficulty 
understanding it. 
(B) Consider a chair. Before you can have an idea of a 
chair, you need to understand that there exist in the 
world certain functional objects. Some of these objects 
support human activity, in this case, sitting. 
(C) The combination of the concepts chair and waiting for 
bus allows you to create the new complex concept 
chair used while waiting for bus. But the basic concept 
of chair is built out of the simpler ideas that we take 
for granted: object, furniture, sitting.

Effective communication is vital to achieving wellness 
because our daily interactions with others are important 
factors in our emotional health. People who have 
developed a high degree of communication skills are 
more likely to have the potential for deeper bonds in 
their personal relationships than non-communicators. 
Perhaps the greatest communication satisfaction comes 
from our close relationships, which are the main source 
of our emotional health. Close relationships develop when 
two people can exchange emotional messages easily and 
effectively. Whether we develop effective communication 
skills that promote healthy interactions depends largely on 
how we learn to communicate. For example, interaction 
between parents and their children is often important in 
determining whether a child is shy or unafraid of 
interaction. Good parents listen to their children and 
allow them to talk about their fears and unhappiness. 
Children raised in households that  
communication find it easier to talk to others about their 
disappointments, fears, frustrations, and other emotions 
later in life. Such individuals find that they ultimately 
have better emotional health.

The school orchestra was practicing in the auditorium, 
and Mr. Grey was clapping his hands to mark the 
rhythm when he heard the town emergency siren. “Stop! 
Everyone!” he shouted. Then, he ran to the door and 
pushed it open. But a burst of wind slammed the door 
right back, and it hit him hard. He fell down and didn’t 
move. Janet was the oldest kid. And (a) she knew 
instantly. This was a tornado.

Looking at the kids around her, Janet yelled as loudly 
as (b) she could, “Rick and Matt, get Mr. Grey on that 
cart and roll him over here! Everyone else, grab the

When everyone came back, Janet asked five of them to 
follow. They ran to where the curtain hung along the 
wall of the stage.

Janet grabbed the edge of the curtain and screamed, 
“Everyone, grab hold and pull!” When the curtain fell, 
they pulled it over the tops of the music stands and the 
grand piano. Then, (c) she motioned everyone to get 
under the curtain. The wind noise rose again, but Janet 
was now safely hidden inside the piano and curtain fort 
with the rest of the orchestra. Relieved, they thanked 
one another and felt oneness in their hearts.
