Instead, it indicates that a very specific question served 
as a negative stimulus and really bothered the person.
I look for lip compression or disappearing lips during 
interviews or when someone is making a declarative 
statement. ( ① ) This is such a reliable cue that it will 
show up precisely at the moment a difficult question is 
asked. ( ② ) If you see it, that doesn’t necessarily mean the 
person is lying. ( ③ ) For example, if I ask someone, “Are 
you hiding something from me?” and he compresses his lips 
as I ask the question, he is hiding something. ( ④ ) This is 
especially accurate if it is the only time he has concealed or 
compressed his lips during our discussion. ( ⑤ ) It is a 
signal that I need to push further in questioning this person.
