What would happen if you went to the soil and said, “Give 
me some fruit. Give me some plants”? The soil would 
probably respond, “Excuse me, sir, but you’re a little 
confused. You must be new here. That’s not the way the 
game is played.” Then it would explain that you should plant 
the seed. You take care of it. You water it and cultivate the 
soil. You fertilize it. You protect it and nurture it. Then, if 
you do it well, you will get your plant or your fruit 
sometime later. You could ask from the soil forever, but it 
wouldn’t change things. You have to keep giving, keep 
nurturing, for the soil to bear fruit― and life is exactly the 
same way.
