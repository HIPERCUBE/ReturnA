32. Table manners help us to see that politeness is not, after 
all, a disadvantage. Although the ill­mannered person can 
grab more of the food, he will receive less of the affection; 
and fellowship is the real meaning of the meal. Next time, 
he will not be invited. Politeness makes you a part of things 
and so gives you an enduring edge over those who never 
acquired it. And this gives us a clue to the real nature of 
rudeness: to be rude is not just to be selfish, in the way 
that children (until taught otherwise) and animals are 
instinctively selfish; it is to be           . Even in the 
friendliest gathering, the rude person will reveal, by some 
word or gesture, that he is not really part of it. Of course 
he is there, a living organism, with wants and needs. But he 
does not belong in the conversation. [3점]
