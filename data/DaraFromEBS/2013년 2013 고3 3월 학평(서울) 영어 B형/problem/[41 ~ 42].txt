Location of events is key to newsworthiness. The 
nearer something happens to your readers, the more 
they should care about it. For example, the news may 
be that a school in your state has adopted a new 
attendance policy that allows seniors to call themselves 
in sick at the attendance office. That’s newsworthy. It’s 
interesting. Right? Now imagine that same event 
happened, not just in your state, but in your own school. 
Which story is more newsworthy? Which would more 
readers care to read?
But again, that’s not to say that news that happens 
only in your own backyard should make it to print. No, 
what good journalists need to do is              news 
events. Even if they happen miles away, most (if not 
all) stories can be made more proximal. You just have to 
ask the right questions, questions that, inevitably, your 
readers should ask. 
Let’s say the story is that a high school golfer in a 
state other than your own has been kicked off the team 
for using illegal clubs. Just ask the right questions. 
Could this happen at your own school? Why? Why not? 
What are the rules governing club use in golf? What are 
the rules to prevent cheating in other sports? Do some 
students get around those rules? How? See what I 
mean? Even events that don’t happen next door have 
meaning. It’s up to you to provide that “closeness,” that 
proximity, to your readers.
