33. Can you recall what you bought for your dinner on the 
same day last month? Probably not. How about this then: 
herdsmen of the Swazi tribe of East Africa are able to 
remember in great detail each cow or bull bought a year 
ago, including who sold the animal, whether it was a bull, a 
cow, or a calf, its age and appearance, and what it was 
bartered for. Impressive, huh? Cattle have tremendous social 
and economic importance in the Swazi tribe. When the 
psychologist Barlett tested these same men on other kinds 
of detail, their memory wasn’t better than the average 
p  erson’s. The conclusion we can draw from this is that we tend to  to         us.
