John Boyle O’Reilly, poet, was one day walking along 
Boylston street in Boston. A stranger who was approaching 
① him from behind mistook him for a friend whom he had 
not seen for a long time. He slapped O’Reilly on the 
shoulder and greeted ② him heartily. Many men in O’Reilly’s 
place would have been annoyed and shown it, but not so the 
poet. Turning about, ③ he stretched out his hand. “I am not 
Jack,” said ④ he, “but I am glad to shake hands with any 
man who is as glad to see an old friend as you seem to 
be.” This handsome speech was a great relief to the 
stranger, who had been much embarrassed upon seeing an 
unknown face turned toward ⑤ him.
