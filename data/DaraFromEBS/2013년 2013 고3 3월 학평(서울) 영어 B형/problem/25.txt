After witnessing an event, we are sometimes exposed to 
new information that can actually change our memory. What 
is known as the “post­event information effect” often results 
from our dialogues with other people. For example, an 
eyewitness to some event frequently discusses with others 
what they saw. In the aftermath of some event, the 
eyewitness and others may speculate as to exactly what 
happened, the sequence in which it occurred, and the degree 
to which various participants were involved. Rather than 
facilitating reproductive memory― the accurate reproduction 
of some past event, an eyewitness’ dialogues with other 
people create reconstructive memory― a reconstruction of 
the past which may be quite inaccurate because it responds 
more to considerations of plausibility than fact. Therefore, 
people can reconstruct inaccurate memories after witnessing 
some event as a result of discussing that event with other 
people.
