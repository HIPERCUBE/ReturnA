The ‘Merton Rule’ was devised in 2003 by Adrian Hewitt, a 
local planning officer in Merton, southwest London. The rule, 
which Hewitt created with a couple of colleagues and 
persuaded the borough council to pass, ①was that any 
development beyond a small scale would have to include the 
capacity to generate ten percent of that building’s energy 
requirements, or the developers would be denied permission 
② to build. The rule sounded sensible and quickly caught on, 
with over a hundred other local councils ③ followed it within 
a few years. In London, the mayor at the time, Ken 
Livingstone, introduced ‘Merton Plus,’ which raised the bar to 
twenty percent. The national government then introduced the 
rule more ④widely. Adrian Hewitt became a celebrity in the 
small world of local council planning, and Merton council 
started winning awards for ⑤ its environmental leadership.
