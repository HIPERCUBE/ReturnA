sit at a cluttered cubicle, a tidy cubicle, or one that was 
in­between. After sitting at the desk, the volunteers 
were asked to rate on a scale of one to nine how well a 
series of statements fit them: “It upsets me to go into 
complicated situations,” “I would like to simplify my life 
as much as I can,” “I would like to keep things simple,” 
and “I am bothered by complicated things.” Next the 
volunteers were given a test in which they needed to 
sort 33 products into groups— the volunteers had to 
come up with an organizing principle themselves. When 
the results were in, it was clear that people sitting at 
messy desks came up with much simpler organizing 
principles. They were also the ones who scored high on 
questions like, “I would like to simplify my life as much 
as I can.”
