What would happen if you went to the soil and said, “Give 
me some fruit. Give me some plants”? The soil would 
probably respond, “Excuse me, sir, but you’re a little 
confused. You must be new here. That’s not the way the 
game is played.” Then it would explain that you should plant 
the seed. You take care of it. You water it and cultivate the 
soil. You fertilize it. You protect it and nurture it. Then, if 
you do it well, you will get your plant or your fruit 
sometime later. You could ask from the soil forever, but it 
wouldn’t change things. You have to keep giving, keep 
nurturing, for the soil to bear fruit― and life is exactly the 
same way.

24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
When we furnish our rooms or fill our closets, we say “I 
want that,” but we also tell manufacturers “make more of 
that” ― setting in motion a whole process of extraction, 
production, distribution, marketing, and sales. In the process, 
we tell each other that this level of consumption is normal, 
natural, and good. Each of our decisions, therefore, is a case 
study in ethics, a determination about the nature of “the 
good life.” As we peruse the stuff available to us, we’re 
making judgements about which goods are good for us and 
why. We don’t think we’re engaged in ethical reflection, but 
we are deciding what we value, and how we will embody 
our values in the material world. Our rooms and our 
belongings send messages about identity and community, but 
they also express our ethical sensibilities, whether we like it 
or not.
① Where we live decides what we consume.
② What we buy reflects what we value in life.
③ Old things carry the memories of their owners.
④ Ethics rarely has an impact on consumer behavior.
⑤ Excessive spending goes against our ethical values.

25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
After witnessing an event, we are sometimes exposed to 
new information that can actually change our memory. What 
is known as the “post­event information effect” often results 
from our dialogues with other people. For example, an 
eyewitness to some event frequently discusses with others 
what they saw. In the aftermath of some event, the 
eyewitness and others may speculate as to exactly what 
happened, the sequence in which it occurred, and the degree 
to which various participants were involved. Rather than 
facilitating reproductive memory― the accurate reproduction 
of some past event, an eyewitness’ dialogues with other 
people create reconstructive memory― a reconstruction of 
the past which may be quite inaccurate because it responds 
more to considerations of plausibility than fact. Therefore, 
people can reconstruct inaccurate memories after witnessing 
some event as a result of discussing that event with other 
people.
* plausibility: 그럴듯함, 있음직함
① How Distortion of Memory Can Occur
② Why We Need to Reconstruct Our Memory
③ Relationship Between Intelligence and Memory
④ Reproductive Memory: A Source of Inspiration
⑤ Dialogue: An Integral Part of Accurate Memory
26. 밑줄 친 he[him]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
John Boyle O’Reilly, poet, was one day walking along 
Boylston street in Boston. A stranger who was approaching 
① him from behind mistook him for a friend whom he had 
not seen for a long time. He slapped O’Reilly on the 
shoulder and greeted ② him heartily. Many men in O’Reilly’s 
place would have been annoyed and shown it, but not so the 
poet. Turning about, ③ he stretched out his hand. “I am not 
Jack,” said ④ he, “but I am glad to shake hands with any 
man who is as glad to see an old friend as you seem to 
be.” This handsome speech was a great relief to the 
stranger, who had been much embarrassed upon seeing an 
unknown face turned toward ⑤ him.

The ‘Merton Rule’ was devised in 2003 by Adrian Hewitt, a 
local planning officer in Merton, southwest London. The rule, 
which Hewitt created with a couple of colleagues and 
persuaded the borough council to pass, ①was that any 
development beyond a small scale would have to include the 
capacity to generate ten percent of that building’s energy 
requirements, or the developers would be denied permission 
② to build. The rule sounded sensible and quickly caught on, 
with over a hundred other local councils ③ followed it within 
a few years. In London, the mayor at the time, Ken 
Livingstone, introduced ‘Merton Plus,’ which raised the bar to 
twenty percent. The national government then introduced the 
rule more ④widely. Adrian Hewitt became a celebrity in the 
small world of local council planning, and Merton council 
started winning awards for ⑤ its environmental leadership.
* raise the bar: 기준을 높이다
28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 
않은 것은?
Sometimes athletes need to be allowed to practice their 
skills on their own before they receive feedback. That way 
they can determine what is working and what isn’t and can 
become more ①mindful of their strengths and weaknesses. If 
you attempt to provide assistance when athletes would prefer 
to practice on their own, you may be ②wasting a lot of time 
and breath. When athletes realize that their best efforts are 
producing ③ satisfactory outcomes, they are usually more 
motivated to hear what you have to say. In other words, 
athletes are responsive to assistance when they fail to achieve 
the outcome they were hoping for. A coach’s challenge, then, 
is to remain patient until these and other types of ④ teachable 
moments arise. The reward for such ⑤ patience is athletes 
who are motivated to hear what you have to say and eager to 
incorporate your suggestions.

The above graph shows six Olympians who won the most 
medals in the Summer Olympic Games. ①Michael Phelps of 
the USA is now the most decorated Olympian of all time 
with a total of 20 medals including 16 gold medals. ② Larisa 
Latynina of the USSR takes up the second place winning just 
two medals fewer than Phelps, but in terms of gold medals 
she is seven medals behind him. ③After Latynina comes 
Nikolay Andrianov of the USSR with a total of 15 medals, 
two golds and one bronze fewer than Latynina. ④ Boris 
Shakhlin of the USSR, Edoardo Mangiarotti of Italy and 
Takashi Ono of Japan won the same number of medals, 13 
medals each. ⑤ In terms of gold medals, however, Shakhlin 
won more than Mangiarotti or Ono, and he even won more 
than Andrianov, who won seven gold medals.
30. MacDowell Colony에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
The MacDowell Colony is an artists’ colony, located in 
Peterborough, New Hampshire, USA. The colony is designed 
to facilitate a balance between social interaction and focus 
on work. Private studios are available to artists 24 hours a 
day, along with the dining and recreation rooms at Colony 
Hall. To ensure all colonists’ autonomy and privacy, no one 
may visit a studio without invitation. Breakfast and dinner 
are served in the dining room; lunch is delivered to each 
studio. After dinner, occasional presentations are a traditional, 
elective part of the stimulating and supportive environment. 
Friendships established among artists in residence often lead 
to collaborations and connections beyond the colony. The 
maximum length of residence is two months; the average 
stay is five to six weeks.

31. When we are children, our bodies grow automatically. A 
year goes by, and we become taller, stronger, more capable 
of doing new things and facing new challenges. I think many 
people carry into adulthood a subconscious belief that 
mental, spiritual, and emotional growth follows a similar 
pattern. Time goes by, and we simply get better. We’re like 
Charlie Brown in Charles Schulz’s Peanuts comic strip, who 
once said, “I think I’ve discovered the secret of life― you 
just hang around until you get used to it.” The problem is 
that we don’t improve by simply living. We have to be  
about it. Musician Bruce Springsteen commented, 
“A time comes when you need to stop waiting for the man 
you want to become and start being the man you want to 
be.” No one improves by accident. Personal growth doesn’t 
just happen on its own.
① content ② defensive ③ intentional
④ thankful ⑤ self­confident
32. Table manners help us to see that politeness is not, after 
all, a disadvantage. Although the ill­mannered person can 
grab more of the food, he will receive less of the affection; 
and fellowship is the real meaning of the meal. Next time, 
he will not be invited. Politeness makes you a part of things 
and so gives you an enduring edge over those who never 
acquired it. And this gives us a clue to the real nature of 
rudeness: to be rude is not just to be selfish, in the way 
that children (until taught otherwise) and animals are 
instinctively selfish; it is to be           . Even in the 
friendliest gathering, the rude person will reveal, by some 
word or gesture, that he is not really part of it. Of course 
he is there, a living organism, with wants and needs. But he 
does not belong in the conversation. [3점]
① clever ② alone ③ talkative
④ impatient ⑤ curious

33. Can you recall what you bought for your dinner on the 
same day last month? Probably not. How about this then: 
herdsmen of the Swazi tribe of East Africa are able to 
remember in great detail each cow or bull bought a year 
ago, including who sold the animal, whether it was a bull, a 
cow, or a calf, its age and appearance, and what it was 
bartered for. Impressive, huh? Cattle have tremendous social 
and economic importance in the Swazi tribe. When the 
psychologist Barlett tested these same men on other kinds 
of detail, their memory wasn’t better than the average 
p  erson’s. The conclusion we can draw from this is that we tend to  to         us.
* barter: 물물교환하다
① follow others’ opinions
② stick to what we believe
③ expect our future positively
④ learn better by imitating others
⑤ remember what matters most to us
34. Aristotle learned a lesson in wisdom in fourth­century B.C. 
Athens, watching the carpenters, shoemakers, blacksmiths, 
and boat pilots. Their work was not governed by 
systematically applying rules or following rigid procedures. 
The materials they worked with were too irregular, and each 
task posed new problems. Aristotle thought the choices 
craftsmen made in acting on the material world provided 
clues to the kind of know­how citizens needed to make 
moral choices in the social world. Aristotle was particularly 
fascinated with how the masons on the Isle of Lesbos used 
rulers. A normal, straight­edged ruler was of little use to 
the masons who were carving round columns from slabs of 
stone and needed to measure the circumference of the 
columns. Unless you bent the ruler. Which is exactly what 
the masons did. They fashioned a flexible ruler out of lead, 
a forerunner of today’s tape measure. For Aristotle, knowing  
was exactly what practical wisdom was all 
about. [3점]
* circumference: 원의 둘레
① how to bend the rule to fit the circumstance
② what to do to relieve stress from work
③ when to stop and when to begin
④ where to apply rigid procedures
⑤ whom to help with one’s skills
35. In one experiment researchers had people sit at computers 
and review two online articles describing opposing theories 
of learning. One article laid out an argument that “knowledge 
is objective”; the other made the case that “knowledge is 
relative.” Each article was set up in the same way, with 
similar headings, and each had links to the other article, 
allowing a reader to jump quickly between the two to 
compare the theories. The researchers hypothesized that 
people who used the links would gain a richer understanding 
of the two theories and their differences than would people 
who read the pages sequentially, completing one before 
going on to the other. They were wrong. The test subjects 
who read the pages linearly actually scored considerably 
higher on a subsequent comprehension test than those who 
clicked back and forth between the pages.                  , 
the researchers concluded.
① The links helped to organize information
② Using the links got in the way of learning
③ Attitude is more important than knowledge
④ The more links, the higher level of popularity
⑤ The Web motivates people to read more articles
36. For a hunter­gatherer ancestor, it would have been useful 
to make plans and be able to follow through with them. It 
might be very advantageous to carefully and deliberately 
develop skills in tool­making, a development whose pay­off 
might be years away, rather than just try to use whatever 
can be grabbed when a tool is needed. However, much of 
hunter­gatherer life is unplannable because of events. It 
would really not be a good response, observing a passing 
herd of wildebeest, to say, “Actually, Wednesday is my 
honey­gathering day.” Life for a hunter­gatherer would be a 
series of urgent improvisations on the stimuli occurring right 
now, be they passing prey, the lack of passing prey, attacks 
by others, changes in the make­up of the group, or countless 
other possibilities. People would do well who could  
and quickly mobilize an energetic, 
spontaneous, physical response to whatever happened to turn 
up. [3점]
① decide to work independently
② choose wise leaders to guide them

When scientists created a hunk of mass called the 
international prototype kilogram(IPK), and distributed about 
40 of these prototype kilograms to other countries, they 
realized contaminants could coat the kilogram’s surface. To 
try to counteract this effect, they made the masses into 
cylinders, which have less surface area to acquire dust and 
debris.     (A)    , the fundamental unit of mass has gained 
tens of micrograms of mass from surface contamination. A 
skilled technician will rub the cylinders with alcohol, but 
because every country cleans their kilograms differently and 
at different times, each kilogram in the world is off by a 
different, unknown amount.     (B)    , each country that 
has one of these standard masses has a slightly different 
definition of the kilogram, which could throw off science 
experiments that require very precise weight measurements 
or international trade in items that are highly restricted by 
weight.                            * IPK: 국제 킬로그램 표준기

Wise leaders don’t just encourage followers to reveal 
bad news. They dig for evidence that clashes with their 
presumptions.
(A) They also believed he was strongly pro­union and 
resisted providing information that could help supervisors 
run the plant during a strike. These assumptions were 
dashed when a foreman asked the mechanic why he 
wasn’t writing things down.
(B) His answer was simple: He felt he had lousy penmanship 
and was ashamed to have his writing on display. Snare 
concludes, “Walk around, look, ask questions. Asking 
questions is the best source of information, yet it is the

(C) Veteran project manager Paul Snare tells how, in a big

Instead, it indicates that a very specific question served 
as a negative stimulus and really bothered the person.
I look for lip compression or disappearing lips during 
interviews or when someone is making a declarative 
statement. ( ① ) This is such a reliable cue that it will 
show up precisely at the moment a difficult question is 
asked. ( ② ) If you see it, that doesn’t necessarily mean the 
person is lying. ( ③ ) For example, if I ask someone, “Are 
you hiding something from me?” and he compresses his lips 
as I ask the question, he is hiding something. ( ④ ) This is 
especially accurate if it is the only time he has concealed or 
compressed his lips during our discussion. ( ⑤ ) It is a 
signal that I need to push further in questioning this person.

In one experiment, 49 college students were asked to 
sit at a cluttered cubicle, a tidy cubicle, or one that was 
in­between. After sitting at the desk, the volunteers 
were asked to rate on a scale of one to nine how well a 
series of statements fit them: “It upsets me to go into 
complicated situations,” “I would like to simplify my life 
as much as I can,” “I would like to keep things simple,” 
and “I am bothered by complicated things.” Next the 
volunteers were given a test in which they needed to 
sort 33 products into groups— the volunteers had to 
come up with an organizing principle themselves. When 
the results were in, it was clear that people sitting at 
messy desks came up with much simpler organizing 
principles. They were also the ones who scored high on 
questions like, “I would like to simplify my life as much 
as I can.”

Location of events is key to newsworthiness. The 
nearer something happens to your readers, the more 
they should care about it. For example, the news may 
be that a school in your state has adopted a new 
attendance policy that allows seniors to call themselves 
in sick at the attendance office. That’s newsworthy. It’s 
interesting. Right? Now imagine that same event 
happened, not just in your state, but in your own school. 
Which story is more newsworthy? Which would more 
readers care to read?
But again, that’s not to say that news that happens 
only in your own backyard should make it to print. No, 
what good journalists need to do is              news 
events. Even if they happen miles away, most (if not 
all) stories can be made more proximal. You just have to 
ask the right questions, questions that, inevitably, your 
readers should ask. 
Let’s say the story is that a high school golfer in a 
state other than your own has been kicked off the team 
for using illegal clubs. Just ask the right questions. 
Could this happen at your own school? Why? Why not? 
What are the rules governing club use in golf? What are 
the rules to prevent cheating in other sports? Do some 
students get around those rules? How? See what I 
mean? Even events that don’t happen next door have 
meaning. It’s up to you to provide that “closeness,” that 
proximity, to your readers.

Recently, Sylvia Sebring had a series of dreams in 
which she saw a light gray mare standing in a corral. 
The horse had a severe limp, and, what was most 
unsettling, the mare was telepathically asking her for 
help. Witnessing the plight of an injured horse was 
certainly not an unusual experience for Sylvia Sebring. 
(a) She is a vet and deals daily with suffering animals. 
But to dream repeatedly of an injured horse that was 
unknown to her was a unique occurrence for her. What 
did the horse want her to do?          * corral: 가축우리
(B)
When Sylvia Sebring visited the corral at the Marana 
Stockyards and saw the Arabian mare, (b) she knew 
immediately that the horse was the same light gray mare 
that she had seen in her dreams. Ms. Sebring knew that 
she had received the horse’s cry for help, and she was 
there to answer that desperate entreaty. At last, the 
outcry from an abandoned and injured horse had been 
answered. (c) She was now the proud owner of the 
Arabian mare and called her Dream Walker.
* entreaty: 간청
(C)
Ms. Sebring felt an eerie shock of recognition as she 
read about the mare found in the desert. The horse in 
the desert seemed to perfectly fit the horse in her 
dreams. Could it be that the horse had been sending her 
desperate messages in her dreams that (d) she needed 
to come and rescue it? Prompted to do some 
investigation regarding the condition and present location 
of the rescued horse, Ms. Sebring learned that the 
animal was due to be auctioned at the Marana 
Stockyards soon.
(D)
One day a local newspaper carried a story about a 
rescued horse that had been abandoned to die by drug 
smugglers in the desert. A US Customs Service aircraft 
had sighted the mare lying nearly dead. The horse had 
lain in the terrible heat of the desert with no water for 
at least a week. The newspaper story described the 
horse as a white Arabian mare, and stated that (e) she 
had a twelve­inch cut on one of her legs.
