Signs of growth of Islam in the United States, Canada, and
recently in Mexico are evident everywhere. ①Mosques, where
Muslims worship, are being built in neighborhoods where once
only churches or synagogues stood. ②Women who wear scarves
covering their hair according to Islamic customs are now a
common sight in many towns and cities. ③Moreover, Muslim
holidays are gaining official recognition in such places as Los
Angeles, Toronto, and New York. ④ Islam is considered by
many to be an alien culture that can’t possibly have any
relationship with normal Western values. ⑤ In addition, an
increasing number of employers are accommodating the religious
needs of their Muslim workers in the same way they respond
to the needs of their Jewish workers.
