41. Buildings― contrary to popular thought― are not lifeless
objects. From the ruins of Byzantium to the streets of New
York, from the roof of a Chinese pagoda to the Eiffel
Tower, every building tells a story. Think of it: When we
consider history, what we see before us are the buildings. If
we look back to Rome, what we see first is the Colosseum
and the Forum. Standing beside the temples of Greece or
near the circle at Stonehenge, we feel the spirit of the
people who created them; their spirits speak to us across
the history. Great buildings, like great literature or poetry or
music, can tell the story of the human soul.
