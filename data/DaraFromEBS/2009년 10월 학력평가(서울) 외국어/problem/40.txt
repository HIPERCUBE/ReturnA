There are also traditional practices outlining what you
should and should not do during an eclipse.
In Nepal, eclipses are traditionally considered bad luck and
many people are already making preparations for any
ill-effects that may accompany the longest total solar
eclipse of this century. ( ① ) In Kathmandu, popular TV
astrology shows are reporting an increase in calls, with
people asking whether the eclipse will mean years of bad
luck and how to avoid it. ( ② ) Basically, eating, drinking
and sleeping are not advised. ( ③ ) Moreover, pregnant
women are told to stay indoors just in case there’s an
adverse effect on their unborn child. ( ④ ) And hospitals
have reported that would-be parents postponed scheduled
caesarean operations, to ensure their children are not born
under bad omens. ( ⑤ ) However, not everyone thinks this
eclipse is bad news; one local airline is scheduled to fly
over Mount Everest to ensure it gets the best view of the
event.
