Mica is a cluster of interesting minerals, giving off water
when heated. The word “mica” is derived from the Latin
word micare, to glitter, in reference to the brilliant
appearance of this mineral, especially when in small scales.
It has the remarkable property of peeling into thin sheets
which not only can be bent but also are elastic unless they
have been carelessly broken. Thick crystals of mica are
called books, as they resemble a volume having many leaves
or pages. The several kinds of mica have different colors
according to the variations in the chemical formula. White
mica, which has the simplest composition, is colorless to
silvery white with shiny surfaces. When magnesium and iron
are present, mica is black. The mica is used in an electric
iron because it is a poor conductor of electricity.
