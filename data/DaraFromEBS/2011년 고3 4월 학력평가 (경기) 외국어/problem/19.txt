One evening before making a presentation at a sales
conference, Mark discovered that he and the vice president of
sales for a large food products firm were both car lovers. “Do
you read Car Weekly?” the vice president asked. At the time
Mark was not familiar with the publication, but ① he was
curious about it. After the vice president told him about the
magazine,　 ② he made a mental note to subscribe to it.
However, his fellow car lover was one step ahead. The next
morning,　 ③ he handed him a subscription card that he had
pulled out of his most recent issue. Mark was struck by how
thoughtful this small gesture was. After that,　 ④ he uses a
similar technique when he talks with friends and clients about
books. If　⑤ he finds out that there is a really great title they
have not read, he will order a copy and have it sent to them. He
believes that this simple act is effective for relationship building.
