A Spanish language school created in Guatemalan village in
1996 offers an example of how tourism can contribute to
conservation. ①The school combines individual language
courses with homestay opportunities and eco-tours.　 ② It
receives around 1,800 tourists yearly and employs almost 100
residents, of whom around 60 percent were previously engaged
in mostly illegal timber extraction and hunting. ③ Careful
monitoring in 2000 has shown that, among the families benefiting
from the business, the majority has significantly reduced old
practices which damaged the environment.　④Numerous animal
and plant species may become extinct soon because of luxury
tourism.　⑤ Furthermore, community-owned private reserves
have been established, and social pressure against hunting has
increased.
