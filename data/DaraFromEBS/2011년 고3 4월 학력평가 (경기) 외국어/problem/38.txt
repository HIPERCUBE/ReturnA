38. A few years ago, a university professor tried a little but
impressive experiment. He sent Christmas cards to a sample of
perfect strangers. Although he expected some reaction, the
response he received was amazing. Holiday cards addressed to
him came pouring back from the people who had never met nor
heard of him. The great majority of those who returned a card
never inquired into the identity of the unknown professor. They
received his holiday greeting card, and they automatically sent
one in return. While small in scope, this study nicely shows one
action of the most potent weapons to influence our behavior.
That is the rule for mutuality. The rule says that we should try
to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.
