39. Over the last fifty years computer modeling has become a
central part of scientific research. With this, scientists can predict
earthquakes, how disease spreads, and many other complex
phenomena. However, it is just an aid to scientists for calculating
predictions from their theories. Experiments will always be
necessary to test these predictions against reality. Computer
modeling is like a sophisticated way of using pen and paper to
calculate the predictions of a scientific theory. Computers may
yield important predictions about complex phenomena, but the
predictions they make can never be relied on without
experimental confirmation. After the computer has made its
predictions, these should be compared with scientific experiments.
