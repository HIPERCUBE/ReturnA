25. I think that, in general, there is too much respect paid to the
opinions of others, both in great matters and in small ones.
Take, for example, the matter of expenditure. Very many
people spend money in ways quite different from those that
their natural tastes would demand. They feel that the respect
of their neighbors depends on their possession of a good car
and their ability to give good dinners. However, to be actually
indifferent to is both a strength and
a source of happiness. A society composed of those who do not
bow too much to the cheering crowd is far more interesting and
desirable than one in which all behave alike. People should be
natural, and should follow their spontaneous tastes in so far as
these are not definitely antisocial.
