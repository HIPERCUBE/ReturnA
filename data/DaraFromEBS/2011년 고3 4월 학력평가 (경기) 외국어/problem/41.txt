41. Today, employers are increasingly confronted with the
problem of retaining talented personnel. The management
should expend time and effort in devising ways to reduce
employee turnover. Most of all, the policies of an organization
should be employee-oriented. This can be achieved by
conducting open-door meetings and encouraging staff
participation in making important decisions. Another important
method to help reduce turnover is by hiring the right people for
the job. It is the responsibility of the management team to
conduct thorough research of the candidate before recruitment.
Though money is not the only reason for high conflict, a
competitive pay could go a long way in motivating an employee.
Competent staff expect their pay to be on par with their peers
working in other organizations. It should also be ensured that
employees are not overworked.
