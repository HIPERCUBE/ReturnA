31. The concept of humans doing multiple things at a time has 
been studied by psychologists since the 1920s, but the term 
“multitasking” didn’t exist until the 1960s. It was used to 
describe computers, not people. Back then, ten megahertz was 
so fast that a new word was needed to describe a computer’s 
ability to quickly perform many tasks. In retrospect, they 
probably made a poor choice, for the expression “multitasking” 
is inherently deceptive. Multitasking is about multiple tasks 
alternately sharing one resource (the CPU), but in time the 
context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple 
tasks being done simultaneously by one resource (a person). It 
was a clever turn of phrase that’s misleading, for even 
computers can process only one piece of code at a time. When 
they “multitask,” they switch back and forth, alternating their 
attention until both tasks are done. The speed with which 
computers tackle multiple tasks that 
everything happens at the same time, so comparing computers 
to humans can be confusing. [3점]
