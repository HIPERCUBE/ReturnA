23. The key to successful risk taking is to understand that the 
actions you’re taking should be the natural next step. One of 
the mistakes we often make when confronting a risk situation 
is our tendency to focus on the end result. Skiers who are 
unsure of themselves often do this. They’ll go to the edge of a 
difficult slope, look all the way down to the bottom, and 
determine that the slope is too steep for them to try. The ones 
that decide to make it change their focus by analyzing what 
they need to do to master the first step, like getting through 
the first mogul on the hill. Once they get there, they 
concentrate on the next mogul, and over the course of the run, 
they end up at the bottom of what others thought was an 
impossible mountain.
