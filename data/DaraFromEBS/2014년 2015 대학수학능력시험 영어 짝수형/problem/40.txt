Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly 
established that certain works have certain effects. Plato is 
sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us 
cowardly; the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress 
such representations. Tolstoy is confident that the artist 
who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those 
feelings on to us; we can no more escape than we could 
escape an infectious disease. In fact, however, the effects 
of art are neither so certain nor so direct. People vary a 
great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and 
in the form which that response takes. Some people may 
indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of 
working out those fantasies in real life. Others may be 
disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence. 
Still others may be left unmoved, neither attracted nor 
disgusted.
