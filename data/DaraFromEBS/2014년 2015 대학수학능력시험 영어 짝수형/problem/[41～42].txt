Increased size affects group life in a number of ways. There 
is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more 
productive than smaller groups (two or three members). 
Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than 
members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach 
less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences 
may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve 
organizational problems. Members may realize that their 
behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely 
that they can coordinate their actions without making a special 
effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their 
members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone 
to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount 
of influence on decisions.
There is evidence that groups with an even number of 
members differ from groups with an odd number of members. 
The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more 
deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of 
members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups 
with an odd number of members― one side always has a 
numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the 
number five has special significance. Groups of this size 
usually the problems we have just outlined. 
Moreover, they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions 
found in groups of two or three. Groups of five rate high in 
member satisfaction; because of the odd number of members, 
deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur.
