21. The most normal and competent child encounters what 
seem like insurmountable problems in living. But by playing 
them out, he may become able to cope with them in a 
step-by-step process. He often does so in symbolic ways that 
are hard for even him to understand, as he is reacting to inner 
processes whose origin may be buried deep in his 
unconscious. This may result in play that makes little sense to 
us at the moment, since we do not know the purposes it 
serves. When there is no immediate danger, it is usually best 
to approve of the child’s play without interfering. Efforts to 
assist him in his struggles, while well intentioned, may divert 
him from seeking and eventually finding the solution that will 
serve him best.
