They also rated how generally extroverted those fake

Some years ago, a psychologist named Richard Lippa called 
a group of introverts to his lab and asked them to act like 
extroverts while pretending to teach a math class. ( ① ) Then 
he and his team, with video cameras in hand, measured the 
length of their strides, the amount of eye contact they made 
with their “students,” the percentage of time they spent 
talking, and the volume of their speech. ( ② ) Then Lippa 
did the same thing with actual extroverts and compared the 
results. ( ③ ) He found that although the latter group came 
across as more extroverted, some of the fake extroverts were 
surprisingly convincing. ( ④ ) It seems that most of us 
know how to fake it to some extent. ( ⑤ ) Whether or not 
we’re aware that the length of our strides and the amount of 
time we spend talking and smiling mark us as introverts and 
extroverts, we know it unconsciously. [3점]
