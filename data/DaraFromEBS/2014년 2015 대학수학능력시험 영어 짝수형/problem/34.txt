New media can be defined by four characteristics 
simultaneously: they are media at the turn of the 20th and 21st 
centuries which are both integrated and interactive and use 
digital code and hypertext as technical means. It follows that 
their most common alternative names are multimedia, 
interactive media and digital media. By using this definition, 
it is easy to identify media as old or new. (A) , 
traditional television is integrated as it contains images, sound 
and text, but it is not interactive or based on digital code. The 
plain old telephone was interactive, but not integrated as it 
only transmitted speech and sounds and it did not work with 
digital code. In contrast, the new medium of interactive 
television adds interactivity and digital code. (B) , 
the new generations of mobile or fixed telephony are fully 
digitalized and integrated as they add text, pictures or video 
and they are connected to the Internet.
