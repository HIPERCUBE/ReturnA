20. Many disciplines are better learned by entering into the 
doing than by mere abstract study. This is often the case with 
the most abstract as well as the seemingly more practical 
disciplines. For example, within the philosophical disciplines, 
logic must be learned through the use of examples and actual 
problem solving. Only after some time and struggle does the 
student begin to develop the insights and intuitions that enable 
him to see the centrality and relevance of this mode of 
thinking. This learning by doing is essential in many of the 
sciences. For instance, only after a good deal of observation do 
the sparks in the bubble chamber become recognizable as the 
specific movements of identifiable particles.
