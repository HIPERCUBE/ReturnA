22. At some time in their lives, most people pause to reflect on 
their own moral principles and on the practical implications of 
those principles, and they sometimes think about what 
principles people should have or which moral standards can 
be best justified. When a person accepts a moral principle, 
naturally the person believes the principle is important and 
well justified. But there is more to moral principles than that. 
When a principle is part of a person’s moral code, that person 
is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the 
principle, and against behavior that conflicts with that 
principle. The person will tend to feel guilty when his or her 
own conduct violates that principle and to disapprove of 
others whose behavior conflicts with it. Likewise, the person 
will tend to hold in esteem those whose conduct shows an 
abundance of the motivation required by the principle.
