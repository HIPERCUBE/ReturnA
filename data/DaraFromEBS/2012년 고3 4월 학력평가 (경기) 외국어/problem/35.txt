35. Design can do more than we expect. It can sometimes change
the world. Take health care, for example. A growing body of
evidence is showing that improving the design of medical
setting helps patients get better faster. In a study at
Pittsburgh’s Hospital, surgery patients in rooms with ample
natural light required less pain medication, and their drug costs
were 21 percent lower, than their counterparts in traditional
rooms. Design can also deliver environmental benefits. The
green design movement is incorporating the principles of
sustainability in the design of consumer goods. This approach
not only creates products from recycled materials but also
designs the products with an eye to their eventual disposal as
well as their use.
