An experiment done on men in North Carolina shows
how helpless we can be in the face of praise. The men in
the study received comments about themselves from
another person who needed a favor from them. Some of
the men got only positive comments, some got only
negative comments, and some got a mixture of good and
bad. There were three interesting findings. First, the
evaluator who provided only praise was liked best by the
men. Second, this was the case even though the men fully
realized that the flatterer stood to gain from their liking
him. Finally, unlike the other types of comments, pure
praise did not have to be accurate to work. Positive
comments produced just as much liking for the flatterer
when they were untrue as when they were true.

most (A) person was the one who had given praise
only, regardless of the (B) of the compliment.
