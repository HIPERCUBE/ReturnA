The graphs above show the results of a survey done on
consumers from Japan, China, Taiwan and Vietnam asking how
much impact the Korean Wave had on their purchase of Korean
products and what kind of Korean product they bought with the
impact. ①More than 40% of the consumers answered the
Wave had a huge impact or a significantly huge impact on their
purchase of Korean products. ②The percentage of people who
said it had a little impact is larger than that of those who
answered little impact by 5%. ③ Interestingly, processed food

purchased with the impact. ④This is followed by cosmetics
with 22.5%, which is greater than the sum of clothes and
accessories. ⑤ IT products and accessories have a similar
percentage with a difference of only 0.2%.
