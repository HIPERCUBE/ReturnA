The purpose of nature-study is to know the subject under
observation and to learn the name incidentally. If you say, “I
have a pink hepatica. Can anyone find me a blue one?” the
children will soon be calling these flowers hepaticas. But if you
say, “These flowers are called hepaticas. Now please remember
the name, and in half an hour I shall ask you again what it is,”
the pupils naturally look upon the exercise as a word lesson and
its real significance is lost. This sort of nature-study is
ineffective. Children should never be ‘required’ to learn the
name of anything in the nature-study work. The name should
be used so often and so naturally in their presence that they
will learn it without being conscious of the process.
