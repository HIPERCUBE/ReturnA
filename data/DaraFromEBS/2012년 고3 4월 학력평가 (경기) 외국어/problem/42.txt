42. Companies once provided not only economic security but
social identity. Many towns were literally company towns, with
a few big corporations providing most of the employment, and
the social and economic infrastructure built around them. You
were a company man, identifying with the company and often
moving largely in the circles created or dictated by it.
However, people don’t stay tied to companies anymore. Instead
of moving up through the ranks of one organization, they move
laterally from company to company in search of what they
want. The playing field is horizontal and people are always on
the move. Now workers have traded security and stability that
companies used to provide for greater autonomy, often
accepting far greater levels of personal exposure and risk.
