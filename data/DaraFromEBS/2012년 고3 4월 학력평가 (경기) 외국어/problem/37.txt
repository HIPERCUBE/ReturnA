37. The Postclassical Period에 대한다음글의내용과일치하는것은?
World historians increasingly use the term The Postclassical
Period for the crucial period from the years 500 to 1450. This
period was set by the collapse of the Roman Empire and the
classical empires in Asia. Two large themes define this period.
First, the period saw the spread of the three major religions—
Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Second, the pace and impact
of international trade accelerated. The Indian Ocean became the
key route for world trade. Dramatic innovations in religion and
trade, then, set the tone for the period. Every society in
Afro-Eurasia had to react to these new forces, though their
reactions varied. In the process, world history gradually changed
from an emphasis on the separate development of key societies
to the interaction among key societies. The period thus
constitutes one of the crucial transitions in the human past.
