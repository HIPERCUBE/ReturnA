Forget the elevator. Let’s take the stairs.
Can you press the button for the 7th floor?
Will you hold the door for me, please?
We’re waiting for both of the elevators. 
Something’s wrong. I feel dizzy in this elevator.

Take your time. Your voice will get better.
Now, I see why your voice is always strong.
You’d better see a doctor for your sore throat.
Thanks. I’ll do my best to become a voice actor.

Are you sure authors carry their stamps?
I’m afraid they won’t sell stamps any more.
Let me ask the clerk what the title of the book is. 
Good. Now, I can exchange it with another one.
Thanks. It’s considerate of you to keep my receipt.

Sorry, but we only have three days to prepare.
No problem. It’s easy to copy the computer file.
I’m happy to hear the presentation date is changed.
Sounds good, but it’s too late for a last minute change.
Fine. I’ll change the presentation as you suggested.

This is a piece of electronic equipment that uses 
invisible waves instead of wires. In order to operate it, 
you need either electricity or a battery. It usually has an 
antenna that helps with the reception of the signal. This 
also has a volume controller and a tuner that you adjust 
to receive programs from different stations. In most cases, 
this functions well without being limited to specific times 
and spaces. This was once widely used to get news and 
information and listen to music. Nowadays, many devices 
are taking its place, but some people still use it.

Kameron once worked hard for several weeks building a 
wall made of railroad ties in his backyard. When he 
was almost finished, his neighbor, Mr. Brown, regretfully 
asked him if he could please take out the railroad ties and 
use rocks instead. He simply explained that his wife 
did not want to look at a railroad tie wall for the rest of 
her life. Kameron could not believe the nerve of this 
neighbor to ask such a thing when he had almost 
finished the wall. Although he did not fully understand his 
reasoning, he knew the Browns would be his neighbors 
for a long time. Although it cost him another week of 
extra work, he did what the neighbors requested and 
replaced the ties with rocks.

If you need to buy food, there is probably a shop or a 
department store close to your home that sells just 
(A) which / what you want. But shopping has not always 
been so easy. Shops started only with the introduction of 
money. In earlier times, people traded crops or objects 
they had made in exchange for the goods they needed. 
The first shops sold just (B) a few / a little products such 
as meat and bread. In 1850, the first department store, a 
shop which sells many different items under one roof, 
opened in Paris. Self-service stores developed in the 
United States in the 1930s. They replaced the old methods 
of serving customers individually by (C) selling / being sold 
prepackaged goods straight from the shelves.

Chocolate can last in a cool, dry place for up to a year. 
When the temperature in your cupboard averages above 
75 degrees Fahrenheit, chocolate may quickly develop thin 
white layers caused by the separation of cocoa butter. 
You can still eat this chocolate, even though it should not 
be used for decorations, as it tends to break easily. 
Though chocolate may be kept in the refrigerator or freezer, 
it will take on the smells of other foods in time, so taste 
before using. Also, making sure to bring chocolate to 
room temperature before eating, as frozen bits of chocolate 
always strike me as rather hard and tasteless.
Ideally, the family is a cooperative, trouble-free unit that 
shelters its members from the stresses of the outside world, 
but real families seldom achieve this ideal. Periodic 
conflicts are the rule, not the exception. Indeed, open 
disagreements and discussions are an excellent way of 
resolving the differences that inevitably develop among 
family members. Families that avoid conflict by 
ignoring unpleasant subjects or situations are weaker, not 
stronger, for it. The family system is very much in 
tune with the social and economic institutions of modern 
industrialized society. As feelings of anger build, such 
families are likely to turn into an empty shell, in which 
family members carry out the obligations of their roles but 
without mutual love or understanding. Thus, an open 
airing of disagreements is an excellent way to manage 
family conflict and keep it within acceptable bounds.

To watch a play is to step into a world that seems far 
removed from electronic beeping and ringing. Of course, 
this is assuming that theatergoers remember to turn off 
their cell phones. At a theater in Goyang, however, stage 
managers have been begging the audience to leave their 
phones on. During the performance, everybody is expected 
to take out their mobiles, call into a computer, and using 
their keypads, direct the movements of puzzle pieces on 
the screen behind the stage. At some point, an ordinary 
housewife appears on the screen, connected from her 
kitchen via the Internet, and interacts with actors on the 
stage in real time. The 50-minute production combines

lost by making one choice instead of another, we are

Excessive consumption of what Chinese Medicine 
considers to be cold-energy foods and raw foods such as 
salads, ice-creams, iced drinks, or fruit may weaken the 
spleen. This idea runs counter to all modern ideas about 
diet, according to which, by eating raw vegetables and fruit, 
we can absorb all the vitamins and minerals contained in 
them. This is true to a certain extent, and moderate 
consumption of these foods can be beneficial. However, 
from the Chinese point of view, the spleen likes dryness 
and warmth in food and dislikes excess of liquids and cold. 
An excessive consumption of the above foods will be very 
difficult to digest and may weaken the spleen. Thus, 
particularly those who have a tendency to spleen problems

We are self-centered interpreters of all incoming information. 
At any given moment, we may note only one aspect of a 
current flow of information, depending on our view of 
ourselves, our attention, and our emotional state in a 
specific situation. Later, we may note still other aspects of 
a similar flow of information. Then, when an attempt to 
recall the second moment is confused with the memory of 
the original moment, our brain starts to create a tale to 
take in different aspects of both the original situation and 
the second moment. We suddenly confuse the two 
episodes, as we begin to put the two sets of events into 
some kind of memory mixture. Alas, ___________ are an 
ideal, not a reality of the human condition.

It is surprising just how tolerant some cats and kittens 
can be with babies and young children, but this is not 
something you should put to the test. You must teach 
children not to (A) disturb / adopt the cat especially by 
grabbing at him when he is resting in his bed. Discourage 
young children from picking up kittens and cats, because 
they may (B) squeeze / release them too hard around the 
belly and make them hate being carried for life. Instead, 
encourage the cat to climb on the child’s lap and remain 
there to be petted. Show children how to stroke the cat and 
how to pick him up and carry him. The cat should never be 
held down during these (C) substitutions / encounters ; be sure 
that the child understands that he or she must allow the 
cat to walk away whenever he wishes.

The lawyer had a unique place within American society. 
In a country without a landed aristocracy, lawyers formed 
a privileged but public-spirited class. In every town and 
city in America, they were the leading citizens who 
helped to build the museums and hospitals, formed civic 
institutions, and moved in and out of government at all 
levels. (A) , James C. Carter was a distinguished 
New York lawyer in the late 19th century. He helped to 
found the Bar of the City of New York and played a key 
role in reform movements in the city and the state, 
including the Citizens Union, the City Club, and the Good 
Government Clubs. (B) , his public life took up 
a good part of his work life. And he was not unusual. 
Lawyers like him could be found in New York and in 
every town in America.             aristocracy:

The above flower spreads out into a circle when you 
look straight into its face. The buttonlike structure sitting 
right in the middle of the flower is actually formed 
from many tiny flowers called disk flowers. The disk 
flowers include petals which are actually individual 
flowers called ray flowers. The ray flowers radiate out 
from the rim of the disk flowers and reach to the edge 
of the whole flower. You can draw the flower easily with 
the following procedure. First, draw two dotted lines that 
will quarter the flower, imagining its shape. This 
enables you to draw the ray flowers correctly and keep 
track of where you are. Next, draw two circle guidelines: 
The inner one indicates the outline of the disk flowers, 
and the outer one, the extent of the ray flowers. Then, fill 
the inner circle with disk flowers and the outer one with 
ray flowers.

I took a room in the Draco Hotel, a pleasant hotel and 
a pleasant room: small but comfortable, with a telephone, 
a small color television, and its own bathroom. I was 
highly pleased and full of expectations about being in a 
new place. I dumped my things and went out to look 
around the town. I soon came to be grateful for not living 
there. It was entirely the opposite of my expectations. The 
hotel was in a dark neighborhood of shipping offices and 
warehouses. There were also a couple of banks, a very 
large police station with its paint peeling off, and a 
weather-beaten post office with a row of telephone booths 
in front. I noticed that the telephone books in the booths 
had been torn or burned and hung from their chains.

Many people may have had the experience of buying 
products that fell apart after hardly any use. Although the 
manufacture and sale of such products do not violate the 
law, intentionally making false claims for a product is 
fraud. Some frauds endanger the health and even the lives 
of citizens. Some drug companies have, for example, 
frequently been caught making false claims about their 
products or hiding information to cover up their dangers. 
Although companies are supposed to seek profits, they still 
need to be morally responsible. Everybody must be a 
good citizen concerned with the health and welfare of all. 
As members of society, companies should be no less 
concerned.
Urban-rural differences in child-growth patterns have 
been known for more than a century. While urban-rural 
differences are well known, the extent of the differences 
between urban and rural samples varies according to specific 
features that characterize the urban and rural communities. 
Thus, urban-rural differences may be non-existent, as they 
often are in contemporary comparisons involving children 
from long-industrialized countries. Or they may be substantial 
as they frequently were in American and European countries 
100 years ago, or as they are today in developing countries. 
In these developing countries, there may be large differences 
in nutrition, medical care, pollutant exposure, parental 
characteristics, and energy use. With this in mind, 
generalization about urban-rural differences is difficult.
If you read lifestyle magazines, you will see how often 
prominent people meet up with other prominent people. 
That is the secret for building up a network. It is through 
these meetings that prominent people become prominent in 
the first place! You might write a bestseller, make a 
fantastic appearance on television, hold seminars that are 
so good that they become legendary, or have incredible 
success in business. But if you are isolated in your private 
life afterwards, your success will not last long. Networking 
should not be regarded as a search for customers or 
partners, but rather as a win-win situation from which 
everyone can benefit.

The above graph shows the ‘operating margin’ represented 
by the line and the ‘net profit’ by the bars in the 
international airline industry from 1999 to 2007. In 1999, 
the operating margin reached its highest point. Since 
1999, the operating margin decreased until 2001 and then 
continually increased. The operating margin was negative 
from 2001 to 2003, being the lowest in 2002. The 
operating margin of 2007 was not as high as that of 
1999. The net profit was the highest in 1999 and the 
lowest in 2001. During the period from 2001 to 2006, 
the net profit was negative.
Colton, a city in California, is currently involved in a 
series of legal battles over how much it should be 
prepared to pay to save an endangered fly: the Delhi 
Sands Flower-loving Fly, a rather pretty insect that takes 
nectar from local flowers. This tiny creature has the 
distinction of being the first fly to be declared an 
endangered species in the U.S. Shortly after this fly was 
listed as an endangered species, construction of a hospital 
parking lot was stopped. The hospital had planned to 
construct its parking lot over seven acres of occupied fly 
habitat, but that suddenly became illegal. The hospital then 
had to spend $4 million redrawing its plans and moving 
its parking lot 250 feet.

Once a famous merchant port of the Portuguese empire, 
Porto today gives the impression of a forgotten city. It 
was built where the slow-moving Duoro River flows to 
the Atlantic through the steep hills guarding the seashore. 
It still carries the features of a busy medieval town in a 
strategically important location for defense. With its 
magnificent castles overlooking the river and a rich history 
of wine making, one might expect it to be one of the 
most visited cities in the world. But hidden as it is in the 
northwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula, few tourists 
make the trip.

I’m not suggesting that you have to watch the news 
constantly, but by reading, listening, and talking, we keep 
up with what’s happening. Successful people don’t get 
stuck by the unimportant details of their own lives, and 
they don’t live in a tiny bubble. Make it your mission to 
know what’s going on in the world in current events, 
music, fashion, science, food, transport, and even TV. 
Successful people are able to hold a conversation pretty 
well on everything and anything because they’re interested 
in what’s going on. You don’t necessarily have to own 
the latest everything, but you should have a rough idea of 
what’s changing, what’s new, and what’s happening, both 
in your community and on the other side of the world.   
For decades, critics have been predicting the death of 
classical music, suggesting that the classical music audience 
has grown old with no younger generation to take its 
place. They point out that orchestras are debt-burdened, 
that major record labels are cutting-back or cutting-out 
their classical operations, and that the number of radio 
stations with classical programming is decreasing. The 
critics conclude that classical music is no longer popular. 
What these critics seem entirely ignorant of, however, is 
that the worldly and educated, so-called ‘Generation-Y’ is 
more apt to take an interest in classical music, and as 
more and more classical organizations take the initiative to 
capitalize on this, the future is beginning to look 
promising. 

Older workers, in contrast, more often have skills that 
are quite specific to the industry or firm in which 
they are currently employed.
Younger workers tend to have more general skills and 
are less certain about where their skills might be put to 
their best uses. ( ) Hence, they tend to move between 
jobs on a regular basis. ( ) But when they leave their 
old job, they have little trouble finding a new one. ( ) 
They already know their best employment option and are 
not inclined to move around between jobs. ( ) When 
they do leave work, however, finding a position that 
matches well with their precise skills is often difficult and 
time-consuming. ( ) Thus, unemployment that is a 
nuisance for a younger worker can be a damaging and 
financially draining experience for a mature worker.

Ralph was asked to work on the citizens’ general 
dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of city 
government. After spending some time with people in 
the city, he found one of the problems was the 
performance of the city planning department.
(A) Ralph determined that the citizens’ complaints were 
justified, so he trained the city planners in setting 
objectives, selecting alternatives, data analysis, and 
coordination. At the end of the training, one of them 
said, “We’ll use this in the future. I’m not going to 
be drawing boxes any more.”
(B) Another one said, “The most important thing is that 
we’ve learned how to coordinate.” Ralph saw that 
the immediate, short-term payoff for the planning 
department was to become more responsive to the 
community and its growth.
(C) Many citizens complained that the planners were 
experts at ‘drawing pictures,’ that is, physical planning 
and design, but did nothing to coordinate what they 
were doing.

The stories you will read here are based on facts from 
eyewitness accounts. They have been collected from a 
wide variety of employees and organizations across the 
United States. The names and, in some cases, genders 
have been changed to protect the identities of the 
individuals. These accounts are only a small sampling of 
general practices currently in operation in American 
Business, and do not reflect an experience within any 
particular company. While these stories expose the darker 
side of American Business, this book does not offer legal 
advice. Any reader who feels she or he needs legal advice 
should consult legal counsel.
Nicknames and their associated identities, in the emerging 
medium of online communication, have become an important 
means in identifying the participants in online chat rooms 
and newsgroups. H. Bays, a sociolinguist, observes that 
online, a nickname can be anything from numbers and 
punctuation to a highly personal or expressive name and 
potentially contains numerous sociological cues such as 
gender, approximate age, music and sports interests. 
Examples may include snowwhite12, lion66, musiclover33, 
and Birdie_sunneyman. She further points out that the 
nickname is the first sign of individuality when one 
encounters another participant. It serves as a first impression 
and shows the aspect of ‘face’ that the participant wants to 
present online.

While we generally equate myths with the ancient 
Greeks or Romans, modern myths are realized in many 
aspects of popular culture, including trademarks, movies, 
comic books, holidays, and even commercials. Commercials 
and advertisements can be analyzed in terms of the 
underlying mythic themes they represent. Often fashion ads, 
especially perfume ads, use fantasy and mythical themes. 
Comic book superheroes also demonstrate how myths can 
be communicated to consumers of all ages. Indeed, some 
of these fictional characters represent a mono-myth, a myth 
that is common to many cultures. The most prevalent 
mono-myth involves a hero who emerges from the everyday 
world with supernatural powers and wins a decisive victory 
over evil forces. Comic book heroes, familiar to most 
consumers, may even be more credible and effective than 
real-life celebrities.

Away across a hundred miles, the mountain tops looked 
like islands in the fog that floated below us. Grandpa 
pointed to the east and said, “Watch.” Above the rim of 
the farthest mountain, on the end of the world, a pink 
stripe swept across, and a paint brush swept a million 
miles across the sky. The morning birth came alive, and 
morning wind picked up. The mountain rim looked like it 
had caught fire; then the sun cleared the trees. It turned 
the fog into a pink ocean, with its waves gently rolling 
up and down. Grandpa said the world had got born all 
over again, and he took off his hat and we watched the 
sunrise for a long time.

Anchoring settling to a certain price range influences 
all kinds of purchases. Uri Simonsohn and George 
Lowenstein, for example, found that people who move 
from inexpensive areas to moderately priced cities do 
not increase their spending to fit the new area. Rather, 
these people spend an amount similar to what they 
were used to in their previous area, even if this means 
having to squeeze themselves and their families into 
smaller or less comfortable homes. Likewise, people 
moving from more expensive cities sink the same 
amount of dollars into their new housing situations as 
they did in the past. People who move from an 
expensive area do not generally downsize their spending 
much once they move to a moderately priced city.

When it comes to talking, I have observed two basic 
personality types. The first I call the ‘Dead Sea.’ People 
with this personality type have many experiences, 
emotions, and thoughts throughout the day. They have a 
large reservoir where they store that information, and 
they are perfectly happy not to talk. On the other 
extreme is the ‘Babbling Brook.’ For this personality, 
whatever enters into the eye gate or the ear gate comes 
out the mouth gate. 
(B)
Many times a Dead Sea marries a Babbling Brook. 
That happens because when they are dating, it is a very 
attractive match. If you are a Dead Sea and you date a 
Babbling Brook, (a) you will have a wonderful evening. 
You do not have to think, “How will I get the 
conversation started tonight? How will I keep the 
conversation flowing?” In fact, (b) you do not have to 
think at all. All you have to do is nod your head and 
say, “Uh-huh,” and she will fill up the whole evening 
and (c) you will go home saying, “What a wonderful 
person!” 
(C)
But five years after marriage, the Babbling Brook 
wakes up one morning and says, “We’ve been married 
five years, and I don’t know (d) you.” The Dead Sea is 
saying, “I know you too well. I wish you would stop the 
flow and give me a break.” The good news is that Dead 
Seas can learn to   (A)   and Babbling Brooks can learn 
to   (B)  . We are influenced by our personality but not 
controlled by it.
(D)
On the other hand, if you are a Babbling Brook and you 
date a Dead Sea, you will have an equally wonderful 
evening because Dead Seas are the world’s best listeners. 
You will talk continuously for three hours. He will listen 
intently to you, and (e) you will go home saying, “What 
a wonderful person!” You attract each other.

Person A Most people access the Internet at public 
libraries to get information. (A) , lawmakers are 
threatening the democratic mission of libraries by forcing 
them to use blocking programs. These programs prevent 
access to many services on the Internet, including websites 
dealing with art, literature, women’s health, religion, and 
free speech. Public libraries should provide information to 
all. What if you cannot afford a home computer and 
your only choice is to use one at the library? If this 
computer has blocking programs, then you are being 
denied the access that people with home computers have.  
Person B No one can deny that public library Internet 
access is of great use, but there is a serious problem 
with access to all Internet services at public libraries. 
Some users take advantage of this privilege by sending 
spam mail, using e-mail to abuse people, and hacking 
into government and corporate systems. (B) , many 
innocent children using the Internet without supervision 
can easily become victims of website operators with 
criminal intentions. The public library is not a private 
home. The most effective way to safeguard Internet users 
at a public library is through blocking programs.
