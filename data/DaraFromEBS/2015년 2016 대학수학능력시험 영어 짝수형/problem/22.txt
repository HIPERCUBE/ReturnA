Twin sirens hide in the sea of history, tempting those 
seeking to understand and appreciate the past onto the reefs of 
misunderstanding and misinterpretation. These twin dangers 
are temporocentrism and ethnocentrism. Temporocentrism is 
the belief that your times are the best of all possible times. All 
other times are thus inferior. Ethnocentrism is the belief that 
your culture is the best of all possible cultures. All other 
cultures are thus inferior. Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism 
unite to cause individuals and cultures to judge all other 
individuals and cultures by the “superior” standards of their 
current culture. This leads to a total lack of perspective when 
dealing with past and / or foreign cultures and a resultant 
misunderstanding and misappreciation of them. Temporocentrism 
and ethnocentrism tempt moderns into unjustified criticisms 
of the peoples of the past.
