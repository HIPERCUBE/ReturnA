Dear Coach Johnson,
My name is Christina Markle, Bradley Markle’s mother. 
Bradley and I were thrilled to learn that you’re holding 
your Gymnastics Summer Camp again this year. So I 
didn’t hesitate to sign up and pay the non-refundable 
deposit for the second week program, which is from July 
13 to 17. But today I remembered that our family is 
going to get back from a trip on July 13, and I’m afraid 
Bradley won’t be able to make it on the very first day of 
the program. Rather than make him skip the day, I’d like 
to check to see if he could switch to the third week 
program. Please let us know if that’s possible. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Christina Markle
