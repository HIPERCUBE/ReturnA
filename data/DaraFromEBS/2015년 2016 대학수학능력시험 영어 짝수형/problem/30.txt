The dancers stood on a two-step elevated stage, so that there 
was a natural gap between those who came to dance and those 
who came to watch. The host randomly pulled the name of a 
well-known dancer, Linx, out of a hat. People cheered. 
According to the format, Linx had to “call out” another dancer 
to battle him on stage. Instead of deliberately choosing 
someone, however, ① he decided to select his opponent 
randomly by making himself into a human spin-wheel. He 
propelled himself into a backspin, covered ② his eyes, and 
extended his arm above his head. When his body finally 
stopped spinning, ③ his arm pointed away from the dancers 
on stage and directly at Dan Tres, standing among the 
spectators. The crowd erupted in “Ohhhhs!” because ④ he 
was an older family man who had not danced hip-hop in many 
years, while the much younger Linx was a nimble b-boy. Linx 
looked embarrassed, but nonetheless ⑤ he called out the 
respected elder to battle.
