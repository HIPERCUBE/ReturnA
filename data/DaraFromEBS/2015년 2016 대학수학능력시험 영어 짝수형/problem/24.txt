The above graph shows the results of a survey conducted in 
2012. It compares the percentage of parents of minor children 
(hereafter, parents) and that of other adults in terms of their 
involvement in six library activities. ① Most notably, the 
percentage of parents is higher than that of other adults in all 
activity types. ② The percentage of parents who browsed 
shelves is the same as that of parents who borrowed print 
books. ③ The percentage gap between parents and other 
adults is largest in the activity of attending classes or events 
for children and is smallest in the activity of using computers 
or the Internet. ④ The percentage of other adults who browsed 
shelves is twice as high as that of other adults who borrowed 
DVDs, CDs, or videotapes. ⑤ Finally, the percentage of 
parents who borrowed e-books is less than 10% but is higher 
than that of other adults who did the same activity.
