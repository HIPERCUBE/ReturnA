Surprised by the vision of an unfamiliar silhouette pushing 
into the house, these dogs were using their eyes instead of 
their noses. 
Remember when you were little and you imagined that 
adults had infinite power? Surely someone who could drive 
the car, open the juice container, and reach the sink could 
make it stop raining. ( ① ) I think that’s the same expectation 
that we have with respect to our dogs and their ability to 
smell. ( ② ) Because they are so good at using their noses, 
we assume that they can smell anything, anytime. ( ③ ) But 
dogs use other senses, too, and the brains of both humans 
and dogs tend to intensify one sense at a time. ( ④ ) Many 
owners have been snapped at by their dogs when they 
returned home with a new hairdo or a new coat. ( ⑤ ) Their 
noses may be remarkable, but they’re not always switched on.
