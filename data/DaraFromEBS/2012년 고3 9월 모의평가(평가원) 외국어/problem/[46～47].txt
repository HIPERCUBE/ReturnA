Our romantic mistakes can always be undone these days, 
which you would think is a good thing. But the very 
reversibility of our romantic commitments has only 
worsened our problem because that also undermines our 
satisfaction with our choices. To see this, you only need to 
look at a study of a group of college students in a 
photography class. The students made a print of their two 
best photographs. They were then told that they could choose 
one of the photos but that the other would be kept on file 
as an example of their work. Then, the teacher added a twist. 
One group was told that their choice was final. Whatever 
they chose, they could not change their minds later. The other 
group was told that they could switch photographs if they 
changed their minds. In a survey taken later, students who 
were allowed to change their mind liked their photos less 
than the other students.
Why this paradoxical result? According to one researcher, 
the brain has a kind of built-in defense system that works 
to make us  choices that cannot be undone. 
Despite thinking that we would like the freedom to change 
our minds, it appears that we are happier with our choices 
if we think they can’t be changed, which means we would 
be better off if we made romantic commitments more 
permanent and more difficult to break, rather than less.
