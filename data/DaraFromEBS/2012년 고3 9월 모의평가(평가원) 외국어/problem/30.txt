preserving biodiversity, there are practical considerations as 
well. We depend on many other species for food, clothing, 
shelter, oxygen, soil fertility― the list goes on and on. In 
the United States, 25% of all prescriptions from pharmacies 
contain substances derived from plants. (A) , two 
substances effective against Hodgkin’s disease and certain 
other forms of cancer come from the rosy periwinkle, a

The island is home to over 10 million people, most of

is being destroyed.
