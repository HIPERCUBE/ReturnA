Beware of . For 
example, one major company has a policy that requires the 
following personnel in order to remove an electric motor: a 
tinsmith to remove the cover, an electrician to disconnect 
the electrical supply, a millwright to unbolt the mounts, and 
one or more laborers to remove the motor from its mount. 
That situation is fraught with inefficiency and high labor 
costs, since all four trades must be scheduled together, with 
at least three people watching while the fourth is at work. 
The cost will be at least four times what it could be and is 
often greater if one of the trades does not show up on time.
