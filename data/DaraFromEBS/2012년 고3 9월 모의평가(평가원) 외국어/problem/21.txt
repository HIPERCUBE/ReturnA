Today, the world of innovation is far different from what 
it was a century ago. The days of the solitary inventor working 
on his own are gone. To oversimplify, basic ideas bubble out 
of universities and laboratories ① in which a group of 
researchers work together: both major breakthroughs, like 
understanding the genetic structure of life, and smaller 
② ones, such as advances in mathematics or basic chemistry. 
Traditionally, intellectual property has played little role in 
③ promoting basic science. Academia believes in “open 
architecture,” meaning ④ that the knowledge that research 
produces should be made public to encourage innovation. The 
great scientists are driven by an inner quest to understand the 
nature of the universe; the extrinsic reward that matters most 
to them ⑤ are the recognition of their peers.
