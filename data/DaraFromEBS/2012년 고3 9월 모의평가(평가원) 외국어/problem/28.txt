28. Guys lost on unfamiliar streets often avoid asking for 
directions from locals. We try to tough it out with map and 
compass. Admitting being lost feels like admitting stupidity. 
This is a stereotype, but it has a large grain of truth. It’s 
also a good metaphor for a big overlooked problem in the 
human sciences. We’re trying to find our way around the dark 
continent of human nature. We scientists are being paid to 
be the bus-driving tour guides for the rest of humanity. They 
expect us to know our way around the human mind, but we 
don’t. So we try to fake it, without asking the locals for 
directions. We try to find our way from first principles of 
geography (‘theory’), and from maps of our own making
(‘empirical research’). The roadside is crowded with locals, 
and their brains are crowded with local knowledge, but we 
are too arrogant and embarrassed to ask the way. So we drive 
around in circles,  
about where to find the scenic vistas that would entertain and 
enlighten the tourists.  [3점]
① waiting for the local brains to inquire
② accumulating and examining the locals’ knowledge
③ going against the findings of our empirical research
④ relying on passengers’ knowledge and experience
⑤ inventing and rejecting successive hypotheses
