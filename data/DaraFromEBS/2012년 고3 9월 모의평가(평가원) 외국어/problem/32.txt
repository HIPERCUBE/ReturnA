One of the most commonly cited reasons for keeping a pet 
animal is for the companionship it can provide. The general 
term companionship usually translates into partaking in 
shared activities, such as walking the dog, playing with the 
cat. However, such behavioral interactions between humans 
and pet animals are usually asymmetrically organized. 
Humans tend to interact with their pets when they feel like 
it, rather than (A) consistently / occasionally  responding to 
the animal’s demands for attention. In addition, it is often 
observed that once interaction between humans and pets has 
arisen, the termination of such interactional sequences 
invariably (B) originates / separates  from the human. This 
suggests that activities like walking the dog and playing with 
the cat only arise when time can be spared from the human 
owner’s other commitments. Therefore, if one views activity 
as a global concept― involving instigation, performance, and 
termination― labeling certain forms of human-pet interaction 
as shared activities may be (C) appealing / misleading .
