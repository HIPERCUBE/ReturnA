Dear Mr. Johnson,
I can’t tell you how sorry I was to learn that the flood 
caused almost total damage to your home. I can only 
imagine what a terrible loss it must be. The very 
prospect of losing everything and having to start all over 
again would be overwhelming for anybody. That is why 
I want to provide you with any assistance that I can. I 
have an extra bedroom that you are welcome to use. As 
your friends and neighbors join forces to support you in 
your time of need, I’m sure that everything will seem a 
little brighter with each new day. In the meantime, please 
take good care of yourself.
With all good wishes,
Richard Jackson

A king once boarded a galley ship. As he passed the crew 
of slaves, ① he asked several of them what their offenses 
were. Almost every man claimed he was innocent. They laid 
the blame on someone else. One young fellow, however, 
spoke out, “Sire, ② I deserve to be here. I stole some money. 
No one is at fault but myself. I’m guilty.” Upon hearing this, 
the king seized ③ him by the shoulder and shouted, “You 
scoundrel! What are ④ you doing here with all these honest 
men? Get out of their company at once!” He was then set 
free. The key to this prisoner’s freedom was the admission 
of ⑤ his guilt.

Today, the world of innovation is far different from what 
it was a century ago. The days of the solitary inventor working 
on his own are gone. To oversimplify, basic ideas bubble out 
of universities and laboratories ① in which a group of 
researchers work together: both major breakthroughs, like 
understanding the genetic structure of life, and smaller 
② ones, such as advances in mathematics or basic chemistry. 
Traditionally, intellectual property has played little role in 
③ promoting basic science. Academia believes in “open 
architecture,” meaning ④ that the knowledge that research 
produces should be made public to encourage innovation. The 
great scientists are driven by an inner quest to understand the 
nature of the universe; the extrinsic reward that matters most 
to them ⑤ are the recognition of their peers.

22. We often dismiss new ideas that could further our growth 
simply because they do not fit within the general framework 
of our preconceived notions and self-concepts. An enormous 
amount of time is spent simply reacting. It’s as if we are 
robots programmed to respond on cue to whatever demands 
the least time and attention, and disregard anything that 
requires putting in extra time and energy to think. We skim 
over the surface thoughtlessly. But we must acknowledge 
that thinking well is a time-consuming process. We can’t 
expect instant results. We have to slow down a bit and take 
the time to contemplate and meditate. It is the only path to 
a more meaningful and efficient existence.
① 우선순위에 따라 일을 처리하라.
② 위기의 순간에는 과감히 결정하라.
③ 충분한 시간을 갖고 심사숙고하라.
④ 선입견을 버리고 객관성을 유지하라.
⑤ 결정한 일은 지체하지 말고 실행하라.
23. Masks are too heavy to uphold indefinitely, and no matter 
how well you believe you are disguising yourself, others 
always know. The consequences are that you waste energy, 
sacrifice productivity, and lose people’s trust. In our study, 
all of the CEOs were concerned that dropping their masks 
would make them appear weak. In every case, however, the 
leader’s subordinates perceived the removal of the mask as 
an act of strength and courage. This, in turn, encouraged a 
culture where those subordinates did the same, creating a 
snowball effect. Some of the ways we helped the CEOs 
remove their masks were to actually name the masks, 
explore the significant personal and professional costs of 
upholding them, and ask the CEOs to reflect on the leader 
they most admired. At this point each of the CEOs was ready 
to rebuild a leadership identity based on values, strengths, 
and ambitions.
① CEO가 되기 위해서는 전문성을 갖추어야 한다.
② CEO는 열정적이고, 희생적이며, 신뢰감을 주어야 한다.
③ CEO는 부하 직원에게 나약한 모습을 보여서는 안 된다.
④ CEO는 자신을 그대로 보여줌으로써 리더십을 재정립할 수 있다.
⑤ CEO의 리더십은 자신이 존경하는 지도자를 모방함으로써 생긴다.

24. When we behave irrationally, our behavior usually seems 
reasonable to us. When challenged, the mind says (to itself), 
“Why are these people giving me a hard time? I’m just doing 
what makes sense. Any reasonable person would see that!” 
In short, we naturally think that our thinking is fully justified. 
As far as we can tell, we are only doing what is right and 
proper and reasonable. Any fleeting thoughts suggesting that 
we might be at fault typically are  by more 
powerful self-justifying thoughts: “I don’t mean any harm. 
I’m just! I’m fair! It’s the others who are wrong!” It is 
important to recognize this nature of the human mind as its 
natural state. In other words, humans don’t have to learn 
self-justifying, self-serving, self-deceptive thinking and 
behavior. These patterns are innate in every one of us.
① spread ② unveiled ③ fortified
④ overcome ⑤ authorized
25. At some point, these days, a parent realizes his or her 
child is tending left. The parent panics. Will the child be 
made fun of? Struggle with writing? Be left out? In the past, 
the parent would have done everything possible to exorcise 
the tendency. Today, more and more parents shrug their 
shoulders, saying it’s okay, maybe even something special. 
Or their attempts to discourage it are milder. This is not an 
isolated reaction. It’s part of the larger trend toward 
. From giving 
children extra time to develop into kindergarteners to 
accommodating their vegetarian appetites, parents today are 
taking their cues from children, rather than the other way 
around. Left-handedness is just the tip of the iceberg― in 
today’s world, parenting is about letting your child develop 
into his or her own person, not about trying to stamp him 
or her into a mold of conformity.
* exorcise: 몰아내다
① neglecting, rather than enhancing, personal traits
② celebrating, rather than suppressing, individuality in kids
③ abandoning, rather than administering, parental supervision
④ analyzing, rather than overlooking, their child’s mischief
⑤ advocating, rather than blaming, early education
26. It is a common misconception among many musicians and 
non-musicians alike that . 
This is not surprising as it is natural to associate music with 
the sounds that create the melody, rather than with the quiet 
spaces between the notes. Because rests are silent, people 
often misinterpret these empty spaces as unimportant. But, 
imagine what would happen if a song was made up of only 
notes, and no rests. Aside from the fact that the “rests would 
be history” (pun intended), there would be a wall of sound 
with no reference point or discernible backbone to the music. 
This is because the spaces between the sounds provide a 
baseline and contrast for the piece, and give music structure 
and texture. In fact, it is a common saying among experienced 
musicians that a full measure of rest can hold more music 
than a full measure of blistering notes. [3점]
① notes are more important than rests
② rests provide a direct reference point to music
③ silence is no less meaningful than sound in music
④ melody is nothing more than a collection of sounds
⑤ structure and texture are the most crucial aspects of music
27. Cost estimates follow from time estimates simply by 
multiplying the hours required by the required labor rates. 
Beware of . For 
example, one major company has a policy that requires the 
following personnel in order to remove an electric motor: a 
tinsmith to remove the cover, an electrician to disconnect 
the electrical supply, a millwright to unbolt the mounts, and 
one or more laborers to remove the motor from its mount. 
That situation is fraught with inefficiency and high labor 
costs, since all four trades must be scheduled together, with 
at least three people watching while the fourth is at work. 
The cost will be at least four times what it could be and is 
often greater if one of the trades does not show up on time. 
* fraught: ～으로 가득 찬
① inefficiency caused by poor working conditions
② difficulty in financing high labor costs in business
③ differences in labor skills when working in groups
④ coordination problems where multiple crafts are involved
⑤ mismatch between personnel and equipment in production
28. Guys lost on unfamiliar streets often avoid asking for 
directions from locals. We try to tough it out with map and 
compass. Admitting being lost feels like admitting stupidity. 
This is a stereotype, but it has a large grain of truth. It’s 
also a good metaphor for a big overlooked problem in the 
human sciences. We’re trying to find our way around the dark 
continent of human nature. We scientists are being paid to 
be the bus-driving tour guides for the rest of humanity. They 
expect us to know our way around the human mind, but we 
don’t. So we try to fake it, without asking the locals for 
directions. We try to find our way from first principles of 
geography (‘theory’), and from maps of our own making
(‘empirical research’). The roadside is crowded with locals, 
and their brains are crowded with local knowledge, but we 
are too arrogant and embarrassed to ask the way. So we drive 
around in circles,  
about where to find the scenic vistas that would entertain and 
enlighten the tourists.  [3점]
① waiting for the local brains to inquire
② accumulating and examining the locals’ knowledge
③ going against the findings of our empirical research
④ relying on passengers’ knowledge and experience
⑤ inventing and rejecting successive hypotheses

29. One day as he walked through the streets of London, 
Thomas Hobbes, the seventeenth-century philosopher, came 
upon an old, sickly man who was begging for money. 
Hobbes, his heart touched, immediately gave the man a 
generous offering. When asked by a friend if he would have 
done the same had there been no religious dictum or 
philosophical principle about helping the needy, Hobbes 
replied that he would. His explanation: he felt some 
(A)  himself when he saw the man’s misery, and so 
just as giving money to the man would relieve some of the 
man’s suffering, it “does also ease me.” This tale suggests 
that we have a bit of self-interest in relieving the misery of 
others. One school of modern economic theory, following 
Hobbes, argues that people give to charities in part because 
of the (B)  they get from imagining either the relief 
of those they benefit or their own relief from alleviating their 
sympathetic distress.
* alleviate: 완화시키다
(A) (B)
① pain …… pleasure
② contempt …… respect
③ doubt …… trust
④ humility …… dignity
⑤ hostility …… friendliness
30. While there are aesthetic and ethical reasons for 
preserving biodiversity, there are practical considerations as 
well. We depend on many other species for food, clothing, 
shelter, oxygen, soil fertility― the list goes on and on. In 
the United States, 25% of all prescriptions from pharmacies 
contain substances derived from plants. (A) , two 
substances effective against Hodgkin’s disease and certain 
other forms of cancer come from the rosy periwinkle, a 
flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. 
Madagascar alone harbors some 8,000 species of flowering 
plants. Unfortunately, Madagascar has lost 80% of its 
forests and about 50% of its native species. Madagascar’s 
dilemma represents that of much of the developing world. 
The island is home to over 10 million people, most of 
whom are desperately poor and hardly in a position to be 
concerned with environmental conservation. (B)  
the people of Madagascar as well as others around the 
globe could derive vital benefits from the biodiversity that 
is being destroyed.
(A) (B)
① In contrast …… Indeed
② In contrast …… Thus
③ In short …… Finally
④ For instance …… Yet
⑤ For instance …… Similarly

Over the course of the past forty years, no country on earth 
has cut its alcohol consumption more than France. While 
consumption of beer and spirits has stayed basically steady 
in France, the per capita consumption of alcohol from wine 
① fell from 20 liters in 1962 to about 8 in 2001. One reason 
for the dwindling wine consumption is the ② acceleration of 
the French meal. In 1978, the average French meal lasted 82 
minutes. ③ Plenty of time for half a bottle, if not a whole 
bottle. Today, the average French meal has been slashed 
down to 38 minutes. Wine is a ④ victim of the disappearance 
of the leisurely meal. It is not the target of the change, but 
the decline in wine consumption is a ⑤ cause of the 
emergence of the faster, more modern, on-the-go lifestyle.
* spirits: 독한 술

One of the most commonly cited reasons for keeping a pet 
animal is for the companionship it can provide. The general 
term companionship usually translates into partaking in 
shared activities, such as walking the dog, playing with the 
cat. However, such behavioral interactions between humans 
and pet animals are usually asymmetrically organized. 
Humans tend to interact with their pets when they feel like 
it, rather than (A) consistently / occasionally  responding to 
the animal’s demands for attention. In addition, it is often 
observed that once interaction between humans and pets has 
arisen, the termination of such interactional sequences 
invariably (B) originates / separates  from the human. This 
suggests that activities like walking the dog and playing with 
the cat only arise when time can be spared from the human 
owner’s other commitments. Therefore, if one views activity 
as a global concept― involving instigation, performance, and 
termination― labeling certain forms of human-pet interaction 
as shared activities may be (C) appealing / misleading .
* instigation: (～하도록) 부추김
(A) (B) (C)
① consistently …… originates …… appealing
② consistently …… originates …… misleading
③ consistently …… separates …… appealing
④ occasionally …… originates …… misleading
⑤ occasionally …… separates …… appealing

33. We sometimes encounter students who come to our offices 
and ask how they could have worked so hard but still failed 
our tests. They usually tell us that they read and reread the 
textbook and their class notes, and that they thought they 
understood everything well by the time of the exam. And they 
probably did internalize some bits and pieces of the material, 
but the illusion of knowledge led them to confuse the 
familiarity they had gained from repeated exposure to the 
concepts in the course with an actual understanding of them. 
As a rule, reading text over and over again yields diminishing 
returns in actual knowledge, but it increases familiarity and 
fosters a false sense of understanding. Only by testing 
ourselves can we actually determine whether or not we really 
understand. That is one reason why teachers give tests, and 
why the best tests probe knowledge at a deep level.
① positive impact of student counseling on study skills
② importance of familiarity in gaining actual understanding
③ relationship between reading and gaining high test scores
④ tests as a means to distinguish real understanding from 
familiarity
⑤ necessity of internalizing reading materials to improve test 
scores
34. Hundreds of species of small fishes exist in well-defined 
social organizations called schools. Fish schools vary in size 
from a few individuals to enormous populations extending 
over several square kilometers. Schools usually consist of a 
single species, with all members similar in size or age. For 
small animals with no other means of individual defense, 
schooling behavior provides a degree of protection. Predatory 
fishes have less chance of encountering prey if the prey are 
members of a school because the individuals of the prey 
species are concentrated in compact units rather than 
dispersed over a much larger area. Moreover, once a predator 
encounters a school, satiation of the predator enables most 
members of the school to escape unharmed. Large numbers 
of fishes in a school may achieve additional survival 
advantages by confusing predators with continually shifting 
and changing positions; they might even discourage hungry 
predators with the illusion of an impressively large and 
formidable opponent.
* satiation: 물릴 정도로 먹음, 포만
① protective instincts of small fish species
② origin of social organizations in small fishes
③ fish schooling as a behavioral strategy for survival
④ necessity of fish farms to save endangered species
⑤ behavioral differences between predatory fishes and prey
35. 다음 글에 드러난 Liz의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Over the sky a plump black cloud moved, erasing the 
stars. At that moment, Liz heard a stealthy step far to her 
left and immediately froze. She slowly released her knees 
and straightened her head, the better to hear. The movement 
stopped, and after a long moment began again. Liz saw a 
dark figure creep into the open and draw near to the trees. 
The figure stood so still and low to the ground that it might 
have been a stump. She called softly, “Tim!” Hearing an 
answering whistle, she went toward her son and, with tears 
of delight, hugged him tightly.
① lonely→ scared
② tense→ relieved
③ sorrowful→ ashamed
④ anticipating→ depressed
⑤ disappointed→ overjoyed
36. Macon에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Imagine the Titanic floating overhead: That’s what it 
would have been like to see the USS Macon fly by. Nearly 
800 feet long, the airship was completed in 1933 as part of 
an effort to equip the U.S. Navy with airborne military bases. 
With an onboard hangar, Macon was capable of launching 
five small fixed-wing planes in midair. But it never saw 
action and went down off California’s Big Sur coast during 
a storm in 1935. Rediscovered in 1980 when a fisherman 
caught a piece of the airship’s debris in his net, the wreck 
was recently surveyed and mapped using sonar and remotely 
operated robots. Government archaeologists continue to 
explore the unique site, which lies in 1,500 feet of water.

Warren McArthur graduated from Cornell in 1908 with a 
degree in mechanical engineering. He began working in the 
budding field of industrial design― patenting ten lamps 
between 1911 and 1914. He moved to Arizona in 1913, 
where he and his brother opened car dealerships. Warren 
originally ventured into furniture design and construction as 
a hobby, but at age 44, he moved to Los Angeles to design 
and manufacture metal furniture. He was among the 
pioneers in the use of aluminum for furniture, and his 
contribution included improvements and patents to facilitate 
mass production. He relocated his factory back East to New 
York in 1933 where he designed and manufactured unique 
aluminum furniture.

39. Restoration assumes that one can recreate an artist’s 
original intent and product. At best, restorers’ and museum 
directors’ aesthetic preferences and historical theories drive 
restorations, for it is impossible to step outside one’s historical 
context. How can restorers be so sure that removing a layer 
of lacquer isn’t merely their subconscious attempt to refashion 
an artwork according to contemporary tastes? What’s 
“restorative” about that? The “restored” Sistine Chapel may 
look “authentic” today, but will it still look so when aesthetic 
and historical theories have changed? Surely the best approach 
with any great work of art is to simply leave it alone.

40. Your culture maintains an implicit “schedule” for the right 
time to do many important things; for example, the right time 
to start dating, to finish college, to buy your own home, or 
to have a child. This unspoken timetable provides you with 
a social clock, a schedule that tells you if you’re keeping 
pace with your peers, are ahead of them, or are falling behind. 
On the basis of this social clock, you evaluate your own social 
and professional development. If you keep up with the rest 
of your peers, then you’ll feel well adjusted, competent, and 
a part of the group. If you’re late, you’ll probably experience 
feelings of dissatisfaction. Although in some cultures the social 
clock is becoming more flexible and more tolerant of deviations 
from the conventional timetable, it still exerts pressure to keep 
pace with your peers.
① Social Clock: An Unavoidable Pressure
② When Is the Right Time to Start Dating?
③ Time Management: A Matter of Concern for All
④ Flexibility and Tolerance of Today’s Social Clock
⑤ Why Is It Better to Keep Pace Than Fall Behind?

Economic distance relates to the time and cost involved in 
traveling from the origin to the destination area and back. 
The higher the economic distance, the higher the resistance 
for that destination and, consequently, the lower the demand. 
① It follows, conversely, that between any origin and 
destination point, if the travel time or travel cost can be 
reduced, demand will increase. ② Many excellent examples 
of this are available, such as the introduction of the jet plane 
in 1959 and the introduction of the wide-bodied jets in the 
late 1960s. ③ Jet planes first cut travel time between 
California and Hawaii, for example, from twelve hours to 
five hours, and demand grew dramatically. ④ A similar 
surge in demand was experienced with the introduction of 
the wide-bodied planes for transatlantic flights. ⑤ The 
agricultural products picked up from Hawaiian farms in the 
morning were on dinner tables in Californian homes by 
evening. The introduction of these planes cut the travel cost 
by almost 50 percent between the United States and most 
countries on the European continent.

42. A former resident of Canton, Ohio, was trying to 
describe her image of the city to her classmates. She 
found they had no image of this mid-sized city. She 
described Canton as a city with major manufacturing 
facilities and a downtown revitalization program.
(A) That fact suddenly crystallized the concept of Canton. 
If Canton is destroyed, the nation might fall. That’s an 
image that gave meaning and fullness to what it meant 
to live in Canton.
(B) Her explanation moved the city from the position of no 
image to that of a negative image. The class concluded 
that Canton is a typical, boring, industrialized city.
(C) Then she suddenly recalled an experience: “I remember  
hearing from a teacher that during World War II Canton 
was a major U.S. target of the Germans.” Imagine, right 
after the cities of Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, 
appears the name of Canton.

43. Studying history is not about memorizing what we 
have been told― it requires us to investigate the 
past. Like a detective, we start with the easy, known 
pieces of information.
(A) You have to go further to ask questions such as, “Why 
was he cruel?” and “What were the results of his rule?” 
Hence, studying history trains us not to accept everything 
we read or hear as the truth. Instead, it trains us to use our 
critical thinking skills to get the full picture of the past.

(B) For example, if someone told you that Chinese Emperor 
Qin Shihuang was a cruel ruler, would you simply accept 
this as the truth? Or, would you ask questions about the 
statement and look for information or evidence to support it?
(C) We then shuffle the pieces around to see how they fit 
together. Once all the pieces fit, we have the full picture. 
As we put the pieces together, we challenge ourselves 
to think of other ways to describe what we know.

While there are many places where this traditional view 
of a scientist still holds true, labs aren’t the only place 
where science is at work.
When you hear the word science, what’s the first thing that 
comes to mind? It’s probably an image of a laboratory filled 
with glassware and sophisticated equipment. ( ① ) The 
person doing the science is wearing a white lab coat and 
probably looks rather serious while engaged in some type of 
experiment. ( ② ) Science can also be found at a construction 
site, on a basketball court, and at a concert. ( ③ ) The truth 
is that science is happening all around us. ( ④ ) It’s at work 
in the kitchen when cooking meals, and we can even use it 
when painting pictures. ( ⑤ ) Architects use science when 
designing buildings, and science also explains why your 
favorite baseball player can hit a home run.

Many of us believe that amnesia, or sudden memory 
loss, results in the inability to recall one’s name and 
identity. This belief may reflect the way amnesia is 
usually portrayed in movies, television, and literature. For 
example, when we meet Matt Damon’s character in the 
movie The Bourne Identity, we learn that he has no 
memory for who he is, why he has the skills he does, or 
where he is from. He spends much of the movie trying 
to answer these questions. However, the inability to 
remember your name and identity is exceedingly rare in 
reality. Amnesia most often results from a brain injury 
that leaves the victim unable to form new memories, but 
with most memories of the past intact.

While media often depict amnesia as a failure to (A)  
past memories, especially one’s identity, most cases of 
amnesia actually leave the sufferers unable to (B)  
new memories with most memories of the past undamaged.

Our romantic mistakes can always be undone these days, 
which you would think is a good thing. But the very 
reversibility of our romantic commitments has only 
worsened our problem because that also undermines our 
satisfaction with our choices. To see this, you only need to 
look at a study of a group of college students in a 
photography class. The students made a print of their two 
best photographs. They were then told that they could choose 
one of the photos but that the other would be kept on file 
as an example of their work. Then, the teacher added a twist. 
One group was told that their choice was final. Whatever 
they chose, they could not change their minds later. The other 
group was told that they could switch photographs if they 
changed their minds. In a survey taken later, students who 
were allowed to change their mind liked their photos less 
than the other students.
Why this paradoxical result? According to one researcher, 
the brain has a kind of built-in defense system that works 
to make us  choices that cannot be undone. 
Despite thinking that we would like the freedom to change 
our minds, it appears that we are happier with our choices 
if we think they can’t be changed, which means we would 
be better off if we made romantic commitments more 
permanent and more difficult to break, rather than less.

[48～50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
Maureen Ferris was my best friend and I sometimes 
visited her house after school. Her mother was stern and 
meticulous about house cleaning. My mother, on the other 
hand, did not care as much about a messy house. She had 
sauce stains on her apron and sometimes allowed the 
laundry to pile up. In the midst of her chores, my mother 
spent time reading. This was her time away from endless 
hours of child care and housework. Unironed school blouses 
and a dirty kitchen might make (a) her feel guilty, but her 
reading never did.

(B)
I carried over the love of reading to my workplace as 
well. Off I’d go to work each day, passing on the gift of 
reading to my students. I’d watch as they discovered they 
could read and make sense of the letters and the words on 
a page. All over the world there was agreement that this was 
important, as important as eating or thinking or working. 
And then one day, I finally understood what (b) she had 
tried to show us, that reading was housework of the very 
best kind.
(C)
One day, as I played in Maureen’s clean house, her mom 
fixed me with (c) her cool gray eyes and said, “Your 
mother’s nice, but she reads too much.” I was stunned. The 
next time I caught my mother reading in her little patch of 
sunlight, I studied (d) her in the doorway and decided her 
apron could use a washing. Shame flushed through me. 
Reading was the cause― pleasure-reading in broad daylight. 
Silently, I made vows that would keep me from sharing my 
mother’s fate.
(D)
I tried my best not to follow in (e) her footsteps, but I 
didn’t know that it was already too late for me. The way 
I treasured my books revealed the extent of how much I 
was already like my mother. The years passed in a blur of 
covertly turned pages until I was a grown-up schoolteacher 
with a husband and children of my own. I struggled 
mightily with my own desire to open a novel in brazen 
daylight. My only guiltless reading occurred at night, when 
the dishes were rattling in the dishwasher and the kids 
were in bed.
