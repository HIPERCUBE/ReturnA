In Hawaiian, aloha means both “hello” and “good­bye.” 
Are you ready to say aloha to an old Hawaiian shirt and 
aloha to a festive new pillow? Now let’s begin making a 
new pillow out of your old shirt.
(A) Now turn the shirt right side out. Begin stuffing it 
through the neck hole. Making sure you fill the arms, 
keep going until the entire pillow is full up to the neck 
opening.
(B) Press the neck down flat, so the opening is closed. Flip 
the collar up and sew straight across so the hole is 
closed. Flip the collar back down again, and now you’ve 
got a cool pillow!
(C) Button the shirt and iron it. Turn it wrong side out, and 
sew the armholes closed and the bottom of the shirt 
closed.
