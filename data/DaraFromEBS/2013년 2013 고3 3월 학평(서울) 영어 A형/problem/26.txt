Facilities managers should be aware of and take advantage 
of available resources to help companies meet the challenges 
of safety issues. Since power failures are rare, for example, 
it is nearly impossible for people to remember what to do 
when they occur. So training is needed to keep memory

Always have regular safety training sessions, usually every 
year, and practice sessions quarterly.
