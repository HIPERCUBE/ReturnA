When we remark with surprise that someone “looks young” 
for his or her chronological age, we are observing that we 
all age biologically at different rates. Scientists have good 
evidence that this apparent difference is real. It is likely that age 
changes begin in different parts of the body at different times 
and that the rate of annual change varies among various cells, 
tissues, and organs, as well as from person to person. Unlike 
the passage of time, biological aging resists easy measurement. 
What we would like to have is one or a few measurable 
biological changes that mirror all other biological age changes 
without reference to the passage of time, so that we could say, 
for example, that someone who is chronologically eighty years 
old is biologically sixty years old. This kind of measurement 
would help explain why one eighty-year-old has so many more 
youthful qualities than does another eighty-year-old, who may 
be biologically eighty or even ninety years old.
