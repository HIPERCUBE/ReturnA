33. Research and development for seed improvement has long 
been a public domain and government activity for the 
common good. However, private capital started to flow into 
seed production and took it over as a sector of the economy, 
creating an artificial split between the two aspects of the 
seed’s nature: its role as means of production and its role as 
product. This process gained pace after the invention of 
hybrid breeding of maize in the late 1920s. Today most maize 
seed cultivated are hybrids. The companies that sell them are 
able to keep the distinct parent lines from farmers, and the 
grain that they produce is not suited for seed saving and 
replanting. The combination guarantees that farmers will 
have to                                                                          . In the 
1990s the extension of patent laws as the only intellectual 
property rights tool into the area of seed varieties started to 
create a growing market for private seed companies. [3점]
