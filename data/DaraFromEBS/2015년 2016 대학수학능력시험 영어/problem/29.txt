The Atitlán Giant Grebe was a large, flightless bird that had 
evolved from the much more widespread and smaller 
Pied-billed Grebe. By 1965 there were only around 80 birds 
left on Lake Atitlán. One immediate reason was easy enough 
to spot: the local human population was cutting down the reed 
beds at a furious rate. This (A) accommodation / destruction 
was driven by the needs of a fast growing mat-making 
industry. But there were other problems. An American airline 
was intent on developing the lake as a tourist destination for 
fishermen. However, there was a major problem with this 
idea: the lake (B) lacked / supported any suitable sporting 
fish! To compensate for this rather obvious defect, a specially 
selected species of fish called the Large-mouthed Bass was 
introduced. The introduced individuals immediately turned 
their attentions to the crabs and small fish that lived in the lake, 
thus (C) competing / cooperating with the few remaining 
grebes for food. There is also little doubt that they sometimes 
gobbled up the zebra-striped Atitlán Giant Grebe’s chicks.
