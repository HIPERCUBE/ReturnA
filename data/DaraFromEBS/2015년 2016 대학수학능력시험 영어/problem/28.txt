The Greeks’ focus on the salient object and its attributes led 
to ① their failure to understand the fundamental nature of 
causality. Aristotle explained that a stone falling through the 
air is due to the stone having the property of “gravity.” But of 
course a piece of wood ② tossed into water floats instead of 
sinking. This phenomenon Aristotle explained as being due 
to the wood having the property of “levity”! In both cases 
the focus is ③ exclusively on the object, with no attention 
paid to the possibility that some force outside the object 
might be relevant. But the Chinese saw the world as consisting 
of continuously interacting substances, so their attempts to 
understand it ④ causing them to be oriented toward the 
complexities of the entire “field,” that is, the context or 
environment as a whole. The notion ⑤ that events always 
occur in a field of forces would have been completely 
intuitive to the Chinese.
* salient: 현저한, 두드러진
levity: 가벼움
