Okay. I’ll tell Jane to fill in for you.
Great! She’d love to take the position.
I promise I’ll consider your resignation.
Good, but you should withdraw your resignation.
Thank you. I’ll find someone as soon as possible.

Probably not. He needs all the rest he can get.
I don’t think he can. His plane is arriving soon.
No. He didn’t say anything when he left this morning.
Of course, he can. He should be at the theater by now.
He already left to buy flowers for your performance.

This started as early as 8000 B.C. During the New
Stone Age as people began to settle into fixed
agricultural communities, this intensified. Originally raised
mainly for their meat, sheep and goats became valuable
also for their milk and wool. Cattle were domesticated
both for meat and skin and as work animals for
agriculture. Their milk production was not a factor until
much later in history when breeding for high milk
production produced suitable cows. Horses were also
domesticated and became important for transportation and
came to play a major part in warfare.

A woman stopped at a flower shop to order some flowers to
be wired to her mother who lived 100 miles away. As she
got out of her car, she noticed a girl sitting on the street
sobbing. The woman asked the girl what was wrong and she
replied, “I wanted to buy a red rose for my mother, but I only
have 75 cents and a rose costs two dollars.” She smiled and
said, “Come on in with me. I’ll buy you a rose for your
mother.” She placed her order of flowers to her mother and
bought a rose for the girl. As they were leaving, she offered
the girl a ride. She responded, “Yes, please, if you could.
Take me to my mother.” The little girl directed her to a
grave and placed the rose on it. This changed the woman’s
plan! She returned to the flower shop, canceled the wire
order, picked up a bouquet of fresh roses, and drove 100
miles to meet her mother.
Mr. Brown wanted his students to learn math in the
context of real life. He felt it was not enough for them
just to work out problems from a book. To show his
students how math could really help them, he held
several contests during the year. The contests allowed his
students to have fun while they practiced math and
raised money. Once he filled a fishbowl with marbles,
asked the students to guess how many marbles there
were, and awarded a free lunch to the winner. Another
time they entered a contest to guess how many soda cans
the back of a pickup truck was held. To win, they
had to practice their skills at estimating, multiplying,
dividing, and measuring. They used most of the prize
money for an end-of-the-year field trip.

If you lead a busy life and are short of time, you may
find that you are eating a full meal only about once a day.
From the standpoint of health this is a bad practice. You
would be treating your body with more consideration if
you had several small meals instead of a single big one.
A given amount of food is used more efficiently by the
body if it is spaced throughout the day rather than eaten at
one sitting. Such symptoms are likely to occur in people
who drink more than five cups of strong black coffee in a
single day. People who have large, infrequent meals tend
to gain more weight and to have a higher level of fat in the
blood than do those who eat smaller quantities (but the
same total) at regular intervals.
We push down our feelings because most of us have
been brought up to believe that there are feelings which are
unacceptable. Some of us learned that all emotions are
unacceptable, while others learned that specific emotions
such as anger or crying are unacceptable. In fact, there is
absolutely nothing wrong with any kind of feeling. When
someone tells you not to feel sad or angry, he or she is
asking the impossible. You can deny the feelings you are
having but you cannot stop them from coming. All that
feelings need, in order to pass, is to be acknowledged and
accepted. Just saying to yourself, or someone else, ‘I feel
angry’ (or sad, or frightened) is a great start. Let yourself
_________ the feelings, good or bad.

Human beings direct their activities toward the
satisfaction of physical wants and general well-being.
They avoid, whenever possible, situations that may bring
about physical deprivation, including pain, hunger, and a
need for sleep. Much contemporary advertising promises
these satisfactions, whether from headache remedies,
fancy foods, or form-fitting mattresses. An individual
can suffer any of these deprivations temporarily, however,
and he may knowingly enter into situations which will
deprive him for a time if he believes that there will be

No matter how we shake or tap the bottle of ketchup,
some of it refuses to come out. In some cases, up to 20
percent of the product is left in the packaging when it
is thrown out. This is not only annoying for consumers
but also poses difficulties when recycling: The leftovers
first have to be removed from the packaging, which is
expensive, time-consuming, and uses a great deal of
water. A German project by the Fraunhofer Institutes,
together with Munich University of Technology and
various industrial partners, will put an end to this dilemma.

When we have made an error, as for example in
adding up a column of figures, we have a tendency to
repeat it again and again. This phenomenon is known as
the persistent error. The same thing happens when we try
to solve a problem; each time our thoughts take a certain
course, that course is more likely to be followed the next
time. The reason that we keep making the same error
repeatedly is that associations form between the ideas in
the chain of thoughts and become firmer each time they
are used, until finally the connections are so well
established that ___________________________________.

About three percent of the weight of sea water is accounted
for by salt. The salt content of the ocean is being continually
added to by runoff from the land, but it is not increasing. Yet
salt cannot leave the sea by evaporation because the water
vapor leaves it behind. So for many years it was a mystery as
to why the sea should ________________, given the rate of
runoff, and particularly if the world was supposed to be
hundreds of millions of years old. The riddle was not solved
until the 1970s, when the deep ocean openings were
discovered. Sea water is swallowed up by these cracks in the
ocean bed; when it reemerges, millions of years later, as steam
from volcanoes, the salt has been filtered out of it on its
passage through the rocks.

I start my long journey with great enthusiasm. The
thought of conquering the mountain stirs me with
anticipation. Although the freezing wind pounds upon me,
I feel flushed with warmth. Just after ten o’clock in the
morning, I finally put my step on the ice-covered peak of
the mountain. A childlike joy spreads through me. I am
the two hundred and ninth person to stand on the summit
of Mount Everest. My heart races as I take in this
glorious moment. The sky is deep blue and cloudless. For
fifteen minutes I cherish the view as the highest person
on earth. I do not feel the tiredness in my legs, for the
journey has been truly worthwhile.

The figure above shows the equipment for downhill and
cross-country skiing and their recommended sizes. As you
can see, the downhill ski is shorter and wider than the
cross-country ski and is about the height of the skier. The
cross-country ski meets the elbow when the arm is held
above the head. In either case, a slightly heavier or more
experienced skier might want a longer ski, and a lighter or
beginning skier might prefer a shorter ski. The cross-country
pole is longer than the one for downhill skiing, and its tip is
bent. The length of the cross-country pole reaches the
armpit. The downhill pole fits comfortably in the hand about
two inches below the armpit. The bottom of the downhill
boot attaches completely to the ski, while the heel of the
cross-country boot is not fastened to the ski.

Early photography continued the trend toward the
imprisonment of the subject and the object of representation.
During photography’s first decades, exposure times were
quite long. (A) , the daguerreotype process required
exposures of four to seven minutes in the sun and from
twelve to sixty minutes indoors. Early photographs
represented the world as stable, eternal, and unshakable.
And when photography ventured to represent living
things, they had to be immobilized. (B) , portrait
studios universally employed various holding devices to
assure the steadiness of the sitter throughout the lengthy
time of exposure. The devices firmly held the person in
place. In other words, a person who wanted to see his own
image became a voluntary prisoner of the machine.

Sometimes all a good cheese needs to stop it from going
bad is a sympathetic ear. Researchers in France have come
up with an ultrasonic sensor that will listen to cheese as it
matures and warn cheese makers of defects. Cheese makers
have to downgrade up to one-fifth of their produce because
of undetected faults. If the new device works well, that
problem could be reduced. The technique involves sending
a low frequency ultrasonic signal through the cheese to a
sensor at the other side. By measuring the change in the
speed and size of the emerging signal, the moisture and
porosity of the cheese can be mapped.

Nobody likes performance reviews. Employees are
nervous they will hear nothing but criticism, and bosses are
nervous their direct reports will respond defensively. So
people generally keep their mouths shut. That is unfortunate
because most employees need help figuring out how to
improve their performance and advance their careers. Also,
it can be harmful to the company if a lack of clear feedback
leads to undesirable work behaviors. There is a way to avoid
this problem. Managers can help employees learn adaptive
techniques like acknowledging negative emotions and
reframing fears and criticisms constructively to prevent
destructive responses. Once people are comfortable asking for
feedback, they will begin to see how they are doing relative
to management’s priorities, and their work will be more in
line with organizational goals.

Composers describe their private world through the use of
sound. Making such a description concrete and detailed
requires not just inspiration but certain practical tools and
skills. No matter what style of music you write, you need to
understand dynamics and speed, the uses of harmony and
rhythm. You also need to know the range and capabilities of
instruments, the possibilities of the human voice, and the
problems of acoustics. You need to be able to devise a
blueprint that communicates to your musicians what it is you
want to hear. A young composer who takes a shortcut in this
technical training in his rush to play the role of a composer
will dry up very fast. If you learn the proper techniques, then
the passion, if it is genuine, will come through.

Costa Rica
Costa Rica means ‘rich coast’ in Spanish. It was
discovered in 1502 and named by Christopher Columbus,
who thought it might be a land rich with gold. However,
Costa Rica has no great mineral wealth. It has, instead,
rich soil and a moderate climate. While other Latin
American nations suffered exploitation from outside the region
and developed societies split by class conflict between
rich and poor, Costa Rica developed an agricultural
economy made up of numerous small farmers. There was
not great wealth, but what there was was spread evenly.
Costa Rica continued its unusual development after it
separated from Spain in 1821, becoming the first Latin
American country to abolish slavery. In 1889 the little
nation held the first free election in Latin America.
TLA
In the early 1960s, Jill Norris, the mother of two sons with
learning difficulties, began to exchange appropriate toys with
other families; out of this she founded the Toy Libraries
Association (TLA). The association opened toy libraries in
community centers, clinics, schools, public libraries, and
hospitals around the world. From these toy libraries parents
and children could borrow toys knowing that they have been
thoroughly tried and tested, not only for their play value but
also for safety. Over the years, the association has involved
leading professional educators and therapists, alongside
parents, in the production of numerous publications on specific
toys and aspects of play. In its early years, the association was
opposed by the toy industry because it was likely to reduce
sales of toys as children were borrowing them.
Clients send a steady stream of clues and messages through
their facial expression, body movement, and voice pitch.
Counselors need to learn how to read these messages without
distorting or overinterpreting them in order to establish and
maintain relationships with their clients. For instance, when
Denise says to Jennie, “It seems that it’s hard for you to talk
about yourself,” Jennie says, “No, I don’t mind at all.” But the
real answer is probably in her nonverbal behavior, for she
speaks hesitatingly while looking away and frowning. Reading
such clues helps Denise understand Jennie better. Our
nonverbal behavior has a way of ‘leaking’ messages about
what we really mean. The unplanned nature of nonverbal
behavior contributes to this leakage even in the case of highly
defensive clients.
Sweeping statements have been made about the effect of
clothing on the behavior of a child. It has been said that a
child who is better dressed is better behaved, and that a child
who is dressed like a cowboy is louder than he is when
dressed in ordinary clothes. Clothing, however, might have a
temporary effect on the behavior of the child, but not a lasting
effect. That is, we would predict that a child who was dressed
in his best clothes and whose mother stressed that they were
‘best’ would be better behaved for a short period, but by the
end of the hour the child would have forgotten his clothes and
would be acting as he would in old clothes. Likewise, the child
who is dressed in a cowboy outfit might be very noisy while
playing cowboys for a brief time, but he might soon change

Due to this trade, the plant variety became widespread
in a region.
For thousands of years, farmers at harvest time have
selected seeds, cuttings, or tubers from superior plants to
save for the next planting. ( ) Farmers often protected the
stored seeds from insects or animals by sealing them in clay
pots or burying them in baskets covered with ash. ( )
They also often stored tubers in cold areas and either
replanted cuttings immediately or kept them dry until the
next planting time. ( ) Farmers thus saved their genetic
stocks from season to season. ( ) They could exchange
remaining stocks with neighbors or exchange them in the
local market. ( ) Organized seed production, however, did
not begin until the early 1900s.

A study found that enrollment in physical education
classes was not related to academic achievement scores,
but involvement in vigorous physical activity was. Students
who engaged in vigorous activity outside of school at least
20 minutes per day, three days per week, were found to
have higher academic scores. Students in the physical
education class spent an average of only 19 minutes out of
a 55-minute class engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity. Given that this amount and intensity of activity in
physical education classes had no correlation to students’
academic achievement, whereas there was a significant
association between academic achievement and vigorous
activity outside of school, the researchers propose that there
may be a certain minimum level of activity necessary to
produce the potentially desirable effects.

The tragic heroes in Shakespeare’s plays have free
will. They possess their own defects of character that
bring their downfalls. Macbeth is ambitious but weak;
Othello is jealous; Hamlet cannot make up his mind but
all three might have made themselves into better human
beings. Nothing outside themselves prevents them from
taking the right path as opposed to the wrong, or tragic,
path. On the other hand, for the heroes in Greek
tragedies where fate embodied in the oracles prevails,
there is no free will. The gods control a man’s destiny,
and one cannot fight the gods. Regardless of their
strength or wisdom, the heroes cannot control their own
future. That is why the heroes in Greek tragedies can be
compared to fish in the net.

When we look at the world and ourselves, we do it
through a set of filters. Think about what a filter is. A
filter is a mechanism that lets some things flow in but
screens other things out.
(A) Through them, we process and assign a weight and
meaning to every event in our lives. Some things
flow in, others are screened out, but everything is
affected: not just what we ‘see,’ but what we ‘hear’
and ‘believe.’
(B) Depending on what the filter is made up of, it can
also alter whatever is looked at or passes through it.
Sunglasses are a good example of a visual filter.
(C) But, obviously, I am not talking here about some
physical apparatus that we can put on and take off,
like a pair of glasses. In fact, the filters I am
mentioning are internal, mental, emotional, verbal,
and perceptual in nature.

The descriptions of sound production have been
rewritten in this edition so as to update the theory on
which they were based and to provide better practical
advice regarding pronunciation problems. Several figures
have been redrawn in order to achieve greater accuracy
and clearer detail. The authors have tried to eliminate
traces of gender-biased attitudes wherever they were
detected, and a definite attempt has been made to balance
female and male references. The most significant kind of
change in the new edition, however, is the result of the
effort we have made to introduce more use of language
for real communicative purposes in the learning activities
suggested for students to carry out.

The introduction of the player piano in the United States
at the turn of the 20th century had been accompanied
by fairly critical comments. Player pianos produced
music mechanically through a set of instructions stored
on a music roll. Although proponents of the player piano
such as piano manufacturers and publishers of sheet
music thought that it would lead to ‘an almost universal
music education,’ many music teachers, musicians, and
composers opposed it. Opponents claimed that one could
copy sound, but not interpretation, and that mechanical
instruments reduced the expression of music to
mathematical systems. For this reason, they believed that
mechanized music lessened the ideal of beauty by
‘producing the same after same, with no soul, no joy, no
passion,’ and that the introduction of the player piano
would lead to the disappearance of amateur players.

Several years ago, we were asked to help with the
merger of two community volunteer groups, who wanted
to join together in order to establish an agency that
would have more influence and better financing than the
two separate agencies of the past. Both were rural
groups, which had traditionally and geographically been
separated by a range of mountains.
(B)
In leading the planning meetings of the two boards, he
carefully kept the groups focused on the long-range issues,
and convinced them not to look at the headquarters
question until the very end of the process. Once the
organizational structure was set, by-laws agreed upon,
and all the volunteers had actually merged, then the
headquarters site was decided on logically and easily,
as it turned out.
(C)
We worked with the two groups to help them set goals,
develop policy, and build an organizational structure.
Meanwhile, the young executive director, who saw a
successful merger as his primary responsibility, was
especially careful about one thing. On either side of the
mountain was a large town. Each of the former agencies
had its own board, a separate staff, and long-standing
regional ties. The executive director understood that the
question of where the new joint agency’s headquarters
would be was an important question as well as a potentially
explosive one.
(D)
By then everyone was so committed to the organization
and its goals that the headquarters question had become a
relatively unimportant, routine one. The executive director
of the merging agencies was primarily concerned about
the long-range good of the organization and the total
community. He used all his influence and persuasive
powers to make that a common focus, and the results
were successful.
