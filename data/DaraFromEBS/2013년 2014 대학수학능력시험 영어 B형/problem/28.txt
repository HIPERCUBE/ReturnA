When people started to plant stored seed stock deliberately, 
they also began protecting their plants. This changed the 
evolutionary ① pressure that these food plants experienced, as 
they no longer had to survive in a natural environment. 
Instead, people created a new environment for them, and 
selected for other characteristics than nature previously had. 
Seeds recovered at archaeological sites clearly show that 
farmers selected for larger seeds and ② thinner seed coats. 
Thick seed coats are often ③ essential for seeds to survive in 
a natural environment because the seeds of many wild plants 
remain dormant for months until winter is over and rain sets 
in. But under human management thick seed coats are 
unnecessary, as farmers ④ evade responsibility for storing 
seeds away from moisture and predators. In fact, seeds with 
thinner coats were ⑤ preferred as they are easier to eat or 
process into flour, and they allow seedlings to sprout more 
quickly when sown.
