Oxygen is what it is all about. Ironically, the stuff that gives 
us life eventually kills it. The ultimate life force lies in tiny 
cellular factories of energy, called mitochondria, ① that burn 
nearly all the oxygen we breathe in. But breathing has a price. 
The combustion of oxygen that keeps us alive and active 
② sending out by-products called oxygen free radicals. They 
have Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde characteristics. On the one 
hand, they help guarantee our survival. For example, when the 
body mobilizes ③ to fight off infectious agents, it generates a 
burst of free radicals to destroy the invaders very efficiently. 
On the other hand, free radicals move ④ uncontrollably 
through the body, attacking cells, rusting their proteins, 
piercing their membranes and corrupting their genetic code 
until the cells become dysfunctional and sometimes give up 
and die. These fierce radicals, ⑤ built into life as both 
protectors and avengers, are potent agents of aging.
