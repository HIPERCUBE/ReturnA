31. Sometimes all the outcomes customers are trying to achieve 
in one area have a negative effect on other outcomes. This is 
very common when companies are busy listening to the ‘voice 
of the customer.’ Traveling salespeople, for example, may say 
they want a smaller cell phone, but they may not have thought 
about how hard that tiny phone will be to use. Carpenters may 
request a lightweight circular saw without thinking about the 
fact that it will no longer have the power to get through some of 
the more difficult jobs. When customers make requests for new 
product features, they are usually focused on solving just one 
problem and are not thinking of how their requested solution 
will . 
In this situation, customers request new features but reject the 
resulting product when they realize the ramifications of their 
suggestions ― the added feature turns out to be worthless 
because of the problems it causes.
