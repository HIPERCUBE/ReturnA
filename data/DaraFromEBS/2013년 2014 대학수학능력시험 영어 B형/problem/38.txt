We tend to perceive the door of a classroom as 
rectangular no matter from which angle it is viewed. 
Actually, the rectangular door of a classroom projects a 
rectangular image on our retina only when it is viewed 
directly from the front.
(A) Slowly the trapezoid becomes thinner and thinner, and all 
that is projected on the retina is a vertical line, which is 
the thickness of the door. These changes we can observe 
and distinguish, but we do not accept them.
(B) Similarly, a round coin is seen as round even when 
viewed from an angle at which, objectively, it should 
appear elliptical. In the same way, we see car wheels as 
round, even though the retinal image is oval when viewed 
from an angle other than directly from the front.
(C) At other angles, the image will be seen as a trapezoid. 
The edge of the door towards us looks wider than the 
edge hinged with the frame.
* trapezoid: 사다리꼴   ** elliptical: 타원형의
