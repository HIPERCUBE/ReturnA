32. My friend was disappointed that scientific progress has not 
cured the world’s ills by abolishing wars and starvation; that 
gross human inequality is still widespread; that happiness is 
not universal. My friend made a common mistake― a basic 
misunderstanding in the nature of knowledge. Knowledge is 
amoral― not immoral but morality neutral. It can be used for 
any purpose, but many people assume it will be used to further 
their favorite hopes for society― and this is the fundamental flaw. 
Knowledge of the world is one thing; its uses create a separate 
issue. To be disappointed that our progress in understanding 
has not remedied the social ills of the world is a legitimate 
view, but . 
To argue that knowledge is not progressing because of the 
African or Middle Eastern conflicts misses the point. There is 
nothing inherent in knowledge that dictates any specific social 
or moral application. [3점]
① to confuse this with the progress of knowledge is absurd
② to know the nature of knowledge is to practice its moral value
③ to remove social inequality is the inherent purpose of knowledge
④ to accumulate knowledge is to enhance its social application
⑤ to make science progress is to make it cure social ills
