34. While predictions about the future are always difficult, 
one can be made with certainty. People will find themselves 
in large numbers of interactions where intercultural 
communication skills will be essential. There are several 
reasons for such prediction. Some reasons include increasing 
amounts of contact brought on by overseas assignments in 
the business world, the movement of college students 
spending time in other countries, and increasing amounts of 
international travel among tourists. Others relate to social 
changes within any one large and complex nation: affirmative 
action, the movement of immigrants and refugees, bilingual 
education programs, and movement away from the goal that 
ethnic minorities become a part of a ‘melting pot.’ Therefore, 
it is essential that people research the cultures and 
communication conventions of those whom they propose to 
meet in the future.
