The clanhouse usually consists of a room adjoining 
the dwelling of the senior female member of the clan.
Hopi religion features a ritual calendar that includes a 
large number of annually required ceremonies. In most cases, 
each ceremony is ‘owned’ by the members of a certain clan. 
( ① ) Every clan represented in a village has a clanhouse 
in which the masks and other sacred items used in the 
ceremonies are kept when not in use. ( ② ) This woman is 
in charge of storing ritual equipment and of seeing to it 
that they are treated with the proper respect. ( ③ ) There 
is also a male head of each clan whose duties likewise are 
partly religious because he is in charge of the performance 
of ceremonies owned by his clan. ( ④ ) A male clan 
head passes his position down to either his younger brother 
or his sister’s son. ( ⑤ ) In this way, culturally important 
ritual knowledge is kept within the clan.
