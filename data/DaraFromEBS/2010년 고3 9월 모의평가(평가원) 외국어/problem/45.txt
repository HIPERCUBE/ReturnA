The information processing model emphasizes rational 
analysis for solving problems, with an emphasis on 
techniques for quickly arriving at a solution. Culturally, this 
orientation fits well with the kinds of mental attributes which 
are normally valued by contemporary Western societies. For 
example, Westerners tend to admire someone who is 
independent and quick-thinking. But these characteristics are 
not universally valued. Agricultural African societies, for 
example, valued looking at the problem in the context of the 
whole society, noting its impact on various features of life. 
In most situations, speed in arriving at a solution was not a 
vital issue. This is also found with the Cree and Ojibway in 
Canada. These groups historically lived in wilderness areas 
and faced many hardships; in these circumstances, they 
would rarely get a second chance at solving problems. 
Consequently, these Native people value taking time to 
reflect on a problem and mentally walk through possible 
solutions before any action is taken.
