The phrase, ‘jack-of-all-trades’ is a ① shortened version 
of ‘jack of all trades and master of none.’ It refers to those 
who ② claim to be proficient at countless tasks, but cannot 
perform a single one of them well. The phrase was first 
used in England at the start of the Industrial Revolution. A 
large number of efficiency experts set up shop in London, 
③ advertising themselves as knowledgeable about every 
type of new manufacturing process, trade, and business. For 
a substantial fee, they would impart their knowledge to their 
clients. But it soon became ④ evident that their knowledge 
was limited and of no practical value. Doubtful industrialists 
started calling these self-appointed experts ‘jacks of all 
trades and masters of none.’ These experts are still with us, 
and as a result so ⑤ does the phrase.
