42. Until recently, it was generally assumed that the first 
humans took a northerly route to leave the African continent, 
walking into the Middle East and then spreading out from 
there. However, mtDNA analysis now suggests the exodus 
may have proceeded via a more southerly route. In 2005, an 
international team of researchers announced that an isolated 
group living in Malaysia appeared to be the descendants of 
humans who left Africa around 65,000 years ago. According 
to the researchers, climatic change underway at the time 
would have made a southerly route easier. The genetic 
evidence suggests perhaps as few as several hundred 
individuals went f irst to India, then Southeast Asia and 
Australasia. If correct, this would explain why humans 
appear to have reached Australia around 50,000 years ago, 
while the oldest human remains in Europe― a jawbone 
found in Romania― are only around 35,000 years old.
