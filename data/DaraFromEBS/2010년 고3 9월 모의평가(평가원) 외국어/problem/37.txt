During the early 1980s, a team of Italian scientists carried 
out a series of studies under a variety of circumstances on 
the ticklishness of people. The researchers found that 
people seem to have one foot that is more ticklish than the 
other― and for most people it is the right. The experiment 
was repeated in 1998 using a special way that a pointed 
nylon rod was stroked across the bottom of the foot three 
times at intervals of a second. After applying it to thirty-four 
people, the researchers confirmed the original finding and 
pushed back the frontiers of knowledge still further by 
showing that males were more ticklish than females. One 
suggested explanation is that the left side of the brain, 
which detects stimuli applied to the right foot, is associated 
with positive emotions such as laughter.
