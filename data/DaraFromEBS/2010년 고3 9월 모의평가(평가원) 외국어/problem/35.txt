35. A famous psychiatrist was leading a symposium on the 
methods of getting patients to open up about themselves. The 
psychiatrist challenged his colleagues with a boast: “I’ll bet 
that my technique will enable me to get a new patient to talk 
about the most private things during the first session without 
my having to ask a question.” What was his magic formula? 
Simply this: He began the session by revealing to the patient 
something personal about himself― secrets with which the 
patient might damage the doctor by breaking the confidence. 
As he was ‘maskless,’ patients began to talk about their lives. 
They opened themselves up to him because he had become 
an open-minded person himself, and openness evoked 
openness. The same principle applies to all human relationships. 
If you dare to take the initiative in self-revelation, the other 
person is much more likely to reveal secrets to you.
① being frank with patients with serious illness
② opening up oneself to draw out the other person
③ need of confidentiality between doctors and patients
④ effects of a new treatment on psychological problems
⑤ rebuilding broken relationships between close acquaintances
