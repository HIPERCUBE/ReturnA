I was pleased to receive your letter requesting a letter of 
reference for a Future Leaders scholarship. As your physics 
teacher, I can certainly speak highly of your academic 
abilities. Your grades have consistently been A’s and B’s 
in my class. Since this is the first semester that I have had 
you in class, however, I do not feel that I am the right 
person to provide information on your leadership skills. I 
would encourage you to request a reference letter from 
those teachers with whom you have had the most 
opportunity to demonstrate those skills. I am sure many 
teachers would be willing to provide letters for you. Good 
luck with your scholarship.
