28. In a study, hundreds of participants were asked to watch a
short film and then discuss it with another participant. Half
the participants were given an “impression management goal”
to appear outgoing, smart, or happy. After the discussions,
participants rated themselves and the person they had chatted
with across several personality traits. Those with an
impression management goal rated their conversation partner
significantly lower on the trait they were trying to show in
themselves, but not on other personality traits. This seems
to happen because when we focus on exaggerating a
particular trait in ourselves, we unconsciously increase the
standard for that trait in others― and they usually fall
short. So just because someone you’re trying to impress
doesn’t seem as active, friendly or positive as you are,
don’t assume that they truly aren’t. It could just be that
has changed the game. [3점]
