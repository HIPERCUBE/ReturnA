board costs for full‑time college students changed over the
last 30 years. ①Over the period, both college tuition fees
and dorm and board costs for full‑time students went up
steadily. ②Of all the periods, the 1978‑1979 period was the
only one when college students paid more for their dorm and
board costs than for their tuition fees. ③During the
1988‑1989 period, tuition fees surpassed dorm and board
costs for the first time and the former cost more than the
latter thereafter. ④The tuition fees of the 2008‑2009 period
were more than twice those of the 1993‑1994 period. ⑤The
gap between tuition fees and dorm and board costs was the
