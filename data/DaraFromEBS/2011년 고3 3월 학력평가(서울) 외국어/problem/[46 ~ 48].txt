(A)
Sen no Rikyu was the most famous tea master of all in
Japan. He was famous for his remarkable ability to
harmonize himself with his guests’ thoughts and to think
one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting to their
taste. Once, another great 16th‑century Japanese tea
master Takeno Sho‑o passed by a house. (a) He noticed
a young man watering flowers near his front gate. Two
things caught Sho‑o’s attention— first, the graceful way
the man performed his task; second, the beautiful rose of
Sharon blossoms that bloomed in the garden.
(B)
Now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the gate
he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu’s
tea room. Immediately inside, (b) he stopped in his
tracks and gazed in astonishment: Before him a vase
hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single
rose of Sharon blossom, the most beautiful one in the
garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu , and
with this one eloquent gesture, had demonstrated that
this day’s guest and host would be in perfect harmony.
(C)
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer— he watched
those around him acutely, understanding the subtle
gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then producing that
desire’s image. Although Sho‑o never spoke of being
enchanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it
in his eye. (c) He knew that studying people’s eyes was a
surer barometer of pain and pleasure than any spoken
word.
(D)
He stopped and introduced himself to the man, whose
name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho‑o wanted to stay, but had
to hurry off for a prior engagement. Before Sho‑o left,
however, Rikyu invited him to take tea with him the next
morning. Sho‑o happily accepted. When Sho‑o opened the
garden gate the next day, (d) he was horrified to see not
a single flower remained. More than anything else, he
had come there to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that
(e) he had not had the time to appreciate the day before.
