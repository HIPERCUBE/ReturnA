Some consumers still remain loyal to the brand‑name
drug, perhaps out of fear that the new generic drugs are
not actually the same as the drug they have been using
for years.
When a firm discovers a new drug, patent laws give the
firm a monopoly on the sale of that drug. ( ① ) During the
life of the patent, the monopoly firm maximizes profit by
controlling the quantity and the price. ( ② ) But eventually
when the patent on a drug expires, other companies quickly
enter the market and begin selling so‑called generic products
that are chemically identical to the former monopolist’s
brand‑name product. ( ③ ) And expectedly, the price of the
competitively produced generic drug is well below the price
that the monopolist was charging. ( ④ ) The expiration of
a patent, however, does not cause the monopolist to lose all
its market power. ( ⑤ )　As a result, the former monopolist
can continue to charge a price at least somewhat above the
price charged by its new competitors.
