41. The forbidding sands of the Sahara might seem an unusual
place for farming. But if you’re farming silicon to make solar
panels, the conditions in the Sahara are more or less
optimal. At least, that’s the thinking behind the Sahara Solar
Breeder Project. The plan, a joint project proposed by
Japanese and Algerian universities, would use the desert’s
immense supplies of sunlight and sand to “breed” solar
power plants and solar panel factories. The idea is to start
with a small number of silicon manufacturing plants that will
produce the silicon needed to manufacture solar panels. Once
those panels are operating, they can be used to power the
silicon plants, which in turn produce more silicon and solar
panels. The universities envision breeding enough silicon and
solar panels by 2050 to supply half the world’s energy.
