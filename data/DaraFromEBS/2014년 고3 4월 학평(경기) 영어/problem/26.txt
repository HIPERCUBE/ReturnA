The cottage of a poor man named Nicholas happened to stand 
in a place which was overgrown with wild bushes. ① He lay 
down under the shade of a hazel tree upon a hot day, about the 
time of harvest. A farmer passed close by ② him with a cart 
heavily loaded with corn. With envious eyes Nicholas looked at 
the cart full of corn, and barely said “Good morning” to the 
farmer. ③ He, however, stopped, and said to Nicholas, “If from 
this land, which is your property, you would cultivate daily as 
many feet as you cover with your lazy body, you would reap 
every year much more corn than you see upon the cart here.” 
Nicholas paid attention to this　advice. ④ He rooted up bushes, 
and worked upon the soil. It cost Nicholas not a single penny, 
and placed ⑤ him and his family in affluent circumstances.
