At the opposite side of the valley, a narrow steep road led 
into the sloping hills. Along this road there now appeared two 
round glaring eyes. They would appear and disappear and 
appear again, each time rounder, more glaring, larger. Cusi was 
terrified. It must be an animal from another world. The lights 
came nearer and nearer with a strange noise and a still stranger 
smell. Then they disappeared completely. Chuto quietly 
laughed, looking down at Cusi’s set face. “Come,” he said to the 
boy. Cusi made himself follow the old Inca man across the 
terraces to the beginning of the road. “They call this thing a 
truck,” Chuto explained. “It won’t hurt you. It has wheels 
instead of feet. It has a motor instead of a heart. It has 
bad-smelling blood by the name of gasoline.” Cusi could finally 
catch his breath and feel more at ease.
