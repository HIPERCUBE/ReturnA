When our minds are at ease, we’re more likely to direct the 
spotlight of attention inward, toward the stream of remote 
associations coming from the right hemisphere of our brains. In 
contrast, when we are diligently focused, our attention tends to 
be directed outward, toward the details of the problems we’re 
trying to solve. While this pattern of attention is necessary 
when solving problems analytically, it actually prevents us from 
detecting the connections that lead to creative insights. “That’s 
why so many insights happen during warm showers,” Subhra 
Bhattacharya, a well-known psychologist, says. “For many 
people, it’s the most relaxing part of the day.” It’s not until 
we’re being massaged by warm water, unable to check our 
e-mail, that we’re finally able to hear the quiet voices in the 
backs of our heads telling us about the insight.
