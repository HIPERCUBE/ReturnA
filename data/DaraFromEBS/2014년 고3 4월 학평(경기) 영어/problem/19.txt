Child-rearing experts always caution parents not to tell children 
they’re bad when they misbehave, but rather to scold them for 
doing bad things. This concept applies to adults, as well. Good 
people occasionally do bad things, and bad people sometimes 
behave like angels. In looking for patterns, it is critical not to 
confuse occasional behavior or feelings with a more permanent 
personality trait or quality. If you’re considering rehiring someone 
who worked for you a few years earlier, you’d be wise to recall 
your past experience with him. But you’d be ill-advised to base the 
decision on a single occasion when he disagreed with you, unless 
you saw other behavior that indicated he was argumentative by 
nature. Isolated episodes don’t usually reveal a permanent state of 
mind. As you search for patterns, ask yourself whether the clue you 
are evaluating is just an isolated event.
