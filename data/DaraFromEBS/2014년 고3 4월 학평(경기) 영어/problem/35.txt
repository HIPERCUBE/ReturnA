35. Costs vary not only with the volume of output, and to 
varying degrees from one industry to another, they also vary 
according to the extent to which existing     (A)     is 
being used. When an airplane with 200 seats is about to take 
off with 180 passengers on board, the cost of letting 20 
standby passengers get on the flight is negligible. That is 
one reason for radically different prices being charged to 
people flying on the same plane. Some passengers bought 
guaranteed reservations and others essentially bought a 
chance of getting on board as standbys. Different levels of 
probability have different costs in airline tickets, as 
elsewhere. The passengers themselves also differ in how 
important it is for them to be at a particular place at a 
particular time. Those on urgent business may want a 
guaranteed reservation, even at a higher price, while others 
may be in a position where     (B)     money is more

another. [3점]
