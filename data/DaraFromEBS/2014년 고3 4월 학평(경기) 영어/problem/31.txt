31. Love is an attitude, an orientation of character which       
, not 
toward one ‘object’ of love. If a person loves only one other 
person and is indifferent to the rest of his fellow men, his 
love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged 
egotism. Yet, most people believe that love is constituted by 
the object, not by the faculty. They believe that all that is 
necessary to find is the right object ―and that everything 
goes by itself afterward. This attitude can be compared to 
that of a man who wants to paint but who, instead of 
learning the art, claims that he has just to wait for the right 
object, and that he will paint beautifully when he finds it. If 
I truly love one person, I love all persons, I love the world, 
and I love life. If I can say to somebody else, “I love you,” I 
must be able to say, “I love in you everybody, I love through 
you the world, and I love in you also myself.” [3점]
