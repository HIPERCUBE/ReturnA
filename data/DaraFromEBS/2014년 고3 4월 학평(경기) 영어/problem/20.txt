Do you know what fear and doubt fear? Community. One of fear 
and doubt’s chief aims is to make you feel alone, like you’re the 
only one who feels a certain way. Fear wants to isolate you and 
put you on an island. As long as you keep your fear to yourself, 
no one can tell you the truth about it. No one can help you see 
what is really going on. No one can encourage you. So if you’re 
going to tell your voices, “Go away,” you’ve got to share them 
with other people. You’ve got to tell your close friends or family 
or a counselor about your voices. The exact person will be 
different for everyone, but never waste time trying to battle a 
voice alone. In some cases that voice of fear and doubt will have 
had a ten-year head start on you. Don’t go it alone.
