Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. Physicists 
have given a fully (A) qualitative / quantitative definition to 
entropy that allows one to describe something’s entropy by 
using a definite numerical value: larger numbers mean 
greater entropy, smaller numbers mean less entropy. 
Although the details are a little complicated, this number, 
roughly speaking, counts the possible rearrangements of the 
(B) concepts / ingredients in a given physical system that 
leave its overall appearance intact. When your desk is neat 
and clean, almost any arrangement ― changing the order of the 
newspapers, books, or articles, moving the pens from their

accounts for its having low entropy. On the contrary, when your 
desk is a mess, numerous rearrangements of the newspapers, 
articles, and junk mail will leave it a mess and therefore will 
not (C) disturb / maintain its overall look. This accounts for its 
having high entropy.
