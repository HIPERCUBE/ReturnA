Leaders, on the other hand, don’t care very much for 
organizational structure or the official blessing of whatever 
factory they work for. 
If leadership is the ability to create change your organization 
believes in, and the market demands change, then the market 
demands leaders, not managers. ( ① ) Managers manage by 
using the authority the factory gives them, and you listen to your 
manager to avoid losing your job. ( ② ) A manager can’t make 
change because that’s not his job; his job is to complete tasks 
assigned to him by someone else in the factory. ( ③ ) They use 
passion and ideas to lead people, as opposed to using threats and 
bureaucracy to manage them. ( ④ ) Leaders must become 
aware of how the organization works, because this awareness 
allows them to change it. ( ⑤ ) Leadership doesn’t always start 
at the top, but it always manages to affect the folks at the top.
