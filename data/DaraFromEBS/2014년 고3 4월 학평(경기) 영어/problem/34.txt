34. The ability to see the situation as the other side sees it, 
as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills 
a negotiator can possess. It is not enough to know that they 
see things differently. If you want to influence them, you 
also need to understand empathetically the power of their 
point of view and to feel the emotional force with which 
they believe in it. It is not enough to study them like 
beetles under a microscope; you need to know                
. To accomplish this 
task you should be prepared to withhold judgment for a while 
as you “try on” their views. They may well believe that their 
views are right as strongly as you believe yours are. You 
may see on the table a glass half full of cool water. Your 
spouse may see a dirty, half-empty glass about to cause a 
mark on the expensive furniture.
