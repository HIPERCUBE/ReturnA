I had volunteered for the charity picnic, and I needed to be 
there on time. Ms. Green, the charity president, was preparing 
this monthly event by herself. Lily complained, “Mom, I don’t 
feel like going today. We’ve volunteered more than five times 
this year.” She was eating slower than usual. I urged her, 
“Lily, don’t you remember we promised to help Ms. Green 
last month? Go and get dressed.” I stood by the door and 
pointed at my watch. She slowly pulled on her sweater and 
said, “I still don’t feel like going.” I started losing my 
patience. I responded, “Don’t you know Ms. Green has a lot 
of work to do for the picnic today? It’s time you started 
thinking about other people.” My voice was growing louder 
with each sentence.
