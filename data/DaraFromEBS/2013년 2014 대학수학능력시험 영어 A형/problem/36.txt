Self-monitoring refers to how much people try to control 
the way they present themselves to others. Those who have 
high self-monitoring want their behavior to be socially 
acceptable. They adjust themselves to any social signal that 
indicates appropriate or inappropriate behavior. (A) , 
if they are in a meeting and see others making suggestions, 
they will try to make suggestions as well. They are also good 
at managing what others think about them. (B) , those 
who have low self-monitoring are not very sensitive to signals 
indicating socially acceptable behavior. They are not too 
concerned about behaving the right way in a specific context. 
For example, if they are in a meeting with the president of an 
organization, they may act bored. They are not deeply 
concerned about how others see them.
