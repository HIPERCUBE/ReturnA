It is well known that some baseball parks are better for 
hitting home runs than others. It is not just the size of the 
park that matters. Other park conditions such as wind and 
humidity also affect whether a ball sails over the fences, and 
players know this. So what happens when a player is moved 
to a team whose baseball park has better conditions for home 
runs than his current one― say, 28 percent better? One 
analysis found that the player hit 60 percent more home runs. 
Why? The answer lies in how achievable you think the goal 
is. If you think you are likely to hit more home runs, you are 
more likely to swing for the fences. But if you think your 
chance of hitting a home run is smaller, your brain will send 
you signals to just try for a single to get on base.
In business and life, just as in baseball, our  
can affect whether we swing for the fences or not. The 
baseball research shows us that what matters is not the actual 
distance to the fence but what our brains recognize that 
distance to be. Consider your work and your current life. Do 
the fences seem too far away to hit a home run? Simply 
adjust the fences so that it seems easier.
