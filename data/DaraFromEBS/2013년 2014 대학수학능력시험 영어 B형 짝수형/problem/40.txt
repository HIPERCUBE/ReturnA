Low-balling describes the technique where two 
individuals arrive at an agreement and then one increases 
the cost to be incurred by the other. For example, after the 
consumer has agreed to purchase a car for $8,000, the 
salesperson begins to add on $100 for tax and $200 for 
tires. These additional costs might be thought of as a 
metaphorical ‘low ball’ that the salesperson throws the 
consumer. One explanation for the effectiveness of 
low-balling is in terms of self-perception theory. When the 
consumer agrees to purchase the product under the original 
terms, that behavior might be used by the consumer to 
infer his sincere interest in the product. This inferred 
sincere interest in the product may enable him to endure 
the increased cost. An alternative explanation is in terms 
of impression management theory. If the consumer were 
to withdraw from the deal after the ‘slight’ change in the 
terms of agreement, he might foster the rather undesirable 
impression of being an irresponsible consumer unaware of 
these necessary charges.
