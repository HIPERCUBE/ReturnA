A friend of mine was sitting in the Miami airport reading a 
magazine while she waited to catch a plane to New York. Her 
attention was distracted by a rough, noisy quarrel taking place 
at the ticket counter. “But I must get to New York today!” 
① an angry lady hotly told the clerk. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but 
there are no more seats available,” came the reply. “But my 
eight-year-old daughter is on that plane. ② I can’t let her fly 
into New York City all by herself,” she cried. “Sorry, lady. The 
flight is full,” came the same answer. My friend had been 
watching and listening to the woman’s woeful story, and her 
heart was touched with compassion for ③ the distressed mother. 
She walked over to the ticket agent and offered to take a later 
flight, if it meant the woman could use ④ her ticket to travel to 
New York with her daughter. The agent welcomed my friend’s 
solution and quickly issued a revalidated ticket to ⑤ the woman, 
and then arranged for another flight for my friend.
