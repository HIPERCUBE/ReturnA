35. Risk management professionals look in the past for 
information on the so-called worst-case scenario and use it 
to estimate future risks ― this method is called “stress 
testing.” They take the worst historical recession, the worst 
war, or the worst point in unemployment as an exact estimate 
for the worst future outcome. But they never notice the 
following inconsistency: this so-called worst-case event, 
when it happened, exceeded the worst case at the time. I 
have called this mental defect the Lucretius problem, after the 
Latin poetic philosopher who wrote that the fool believes that 
the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest 
one he has observed. The same can be seen in the Fukushima

when a tsunami struck. It had been built to endure the worst
