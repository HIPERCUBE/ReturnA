34. Our craving for                       is illustrated by a 
study of religious Israeli women, carried out by 
anthropologists Richard Sosis and W. Penn Handwerker. 
During the 2006 Lebanon War the town of Tzfat and its 
environs in the Galilee region of northern Israel were hit by 
dozens of rockets daily. Although siren warnings alerted 
Tzfat residents to protect their own lives by taking refuge 
in bomb shelters, they could do nothing to protect their 
houses. Realistically, that threat from the rockets was 
unpredictable and uncontrollable. Nevertheless, about 
two-thirds of the women interviewed by Sosis and 
Handwerker recited psalms every day to cope with the 
stress of the rocket attacks. When they were asked why 
they did so, a common reply was that they felt compelled 
“to do something” as opposed to doing nothing at all. 
Although reciting psalms does not actually deflect rockets, it 
did provide the women with a sense of control as they took 
action in their own way.                * deflect: 빗나가게 하다
