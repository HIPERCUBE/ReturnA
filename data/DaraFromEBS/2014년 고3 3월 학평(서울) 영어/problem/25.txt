25. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
I remember one of the smartest I.T. executives ①for whom 
I ever worked strongly resisting the movement to measure 
programmer productivity that was popular at the time. He was 
fond of saying that the biggest problem with managing 
computer programmers is that you can never tell ②whether 
they are working by looking at them. Picture two programmers 
working side by side. One is leaning back in his chair with his 
eyes ③closed and his feet on the desk. The other is working 
hard, typing code into his computer. The one with his feet up 
could be thinking, and the other one may be too busy typing 
④ to give it enough thought. In the end, the busy typist could 
well produce ten times as many lines of code as the thinker, 
which contain twice as many new problems as the thinker’s. 
Unfortunately, most of the productivity measurement schemes 
I have encountered ⑤measuring effort or apparent activity. 
They would reward him and punish his thoughtful neighbor.
