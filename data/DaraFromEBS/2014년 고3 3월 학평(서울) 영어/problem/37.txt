37. The tight bonds we form with our tools go both ways. 
Even as our technologies become extensions of ourselves, 
we become extensions of our technologies. When the 
carpenter takes his hammer into his hand, he can use that 
hand to do only what a hammer can do. The hand becomes 
an implement for pounding and pulling nails. When the 
soldier puts the binoculars to his eyes, he can see only 
what the lenses allow him to see. His field of view 
lengthens, but he becomes blind to what’s nearby. 
Nietzsche’s experience with his typewriter provides a 
particularly good illustration of the way __________________. 
Not only did the philosopher come to imagine that his 
typewriter was “a thing like me”; he also sensed that he 
was becoming a thing like it, that his typewriter was 
shaping his thoughts. [3점]
