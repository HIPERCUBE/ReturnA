Mr. Aryeh noticed a young boy coming to school in old 
worn-out shoes. Clearly ① he needed a new pair, but Mr. 
Aryeh also knew that the boy’s father, a proud man, would 
be humiliated and offended if ② his son were treated as a 
charity case and given a pair. How does a person with moral 
imagination provide a boy with shoes, while not paining his 
father’s soul? During a morning recess break, Mr. Aryeh 
called the boy to his office because, he said, he needed to 
test ③ him on his English proficiency. He asked the boy 
several questions, well within the youth’s grasp. “Wonderful!” 
Mr. Aryeh said when the boy answered correctly. He gave 
④ the youngster two notes: one to be brought to a local 
shoemaker, with instructions to give the boy a good pair of 
shoes, for which Mr. Aryeh would pay; the second, a note 
to the boy’s father telling ⑤ him about the “prize” his son 
had won.
