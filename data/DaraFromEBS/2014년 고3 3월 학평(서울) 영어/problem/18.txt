Dear C&G Waste Services, 
Westwood High School is currently establishing a paper 
recycling program. With the help of students and staff, 
we aim to significantly reduce the amount of paper that 
goes into the trash by recycling paper. We currently have 
a dumpster that will hold the paper recycling, but we 
need containers for individual classrooms to meet our 
goal. We would like to request 20 containers. We also 
need 2,000 clear trash bags in order to allow students 
and staff to get the paper to the recycle dumpster. So, 
we are asking your company if it will donate these items 
so that we may succeed in conserving our natural 
resources. Please contact me if you have any questions. 
We look forward to establishing a partnership with C&G 
Waste Services. We know that these types of 
partnerships help us give back to the community and 
enhance actions our students can take towards helping 
the environment.
Sincerely,
Anna Wilson
