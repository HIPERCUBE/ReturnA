(A)
In Australia a few years ago, I met a remarkable man 
named John Walton. He has since become a close friend. He 
told me that when he started out in life he seemed to be 
caught in a peculiar failure pattern. Whatever he tried would 
start out well and then end up badly. As a schoolboy he 
dropped out of several schools for this reason. He became 
convinced that it was his destiny in life to make good 
beginnings and then watch them fade away. 
(B)
The speaker also said, “Most of you are letting the fear of 
failure hold you back. All the ingredients of success are right 
there inside you, if you’ll just turn your thinking around. 
Don’t keep telling yourself you can’t do this or you can’t do 
that. You can do ANYTHING if you think you can!” John 
had never heard anything like this in his whole life. He 
realized for the first time that his image of himself as a 
person who started well and then faded away was all in his 
head, a state of mind that could be altered any time he made 
a firm decision to alter it.
(C)
At one point, John got a job with the Australian division of a 
famous American company. The same dreary pattern seemed 
to be unfolding: He started out well, and then things began to 
slide. This didn’t surprise him much; it was what he expected 
to happen. Then the company sent a motivational speaker out 
to give some talks to their Australian employees, and John 
was in the audience. The visitor told his listeners to visualize 
themselves moving up in the company, receiving promotions, 
gaining energy as they went, right up to the very top.
(D)
John went back to work with tremendous enthusiasm and 
confidence and energy. He received promotions. He became 
the manager of a branch in New South Wales. Finally he 
became the head of the company for all of Australia. Where 
once he had been dogged by failure, now everything he did 
was crowned by success. He told me, “It was that one talk 
that changed my self-image by giving it a little twist. It made 
me see myself differently, and so I was different.”
