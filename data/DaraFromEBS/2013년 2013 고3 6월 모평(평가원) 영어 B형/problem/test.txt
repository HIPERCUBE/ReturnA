Everyone would like to assume that their wonderful, 
creative ideas will sell themselves. But as Galileo, Edvard 
Munch, Toni Morrison, Sylvia Plath, and millions of others 
have discovered, they do not. On the contrary, creative ideas 
are usually viewed with suspicion and distrust. Thus, students 
need to learn how to persuade other people of the value of 
their ideas. This selling is part of the practical aspect of 
creative thinking. If students do a science project, it is a good 
idea for them to present it and demonstrate why it makes an 
important contribution. If they develop a plan for a new form 
of government, they should explain why it is better than the 
existing form of government.

24. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
In the nineteenth century, a decisive moment occurred when 
people in advertising and journalism discovered that if they 
framed their stories and appeals with fear, they could capture 
our attention. It is an emotion we find hard to resist or control, 
and so they constantly shifted our focus to new possible 
sources of anxiety: the latest health scare, the new crime 
wave, and endless hazards in the environment of which we 
were not aware. With the increasing sophistication of the 
media and the haunting quality of the imagery, they have been 
able to give us the feeling that we are fragile creatures in an 
environment full of danger― even though we live in a world 
infinitely safer and more predictable than anything our 
ancestors knew. With their help, our anxieties have only 
increased.
① the crisis of modern journalism
② the various sources of human fears
③ the media’s exploitation of human anxieties
④ the importance of advertising and journalism
⑤ the fragile nature of human life in modern society

25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
In the past, many public-sector recreation providers allowed 
people free access or charged for permits to control the 
amount or season for different recreational activities such as 
fishing or horse-riding. However, governments and other 
public agencies are finding that funding to maintain sites and 
facilities, to cope with increased demand on the landscape, is 
becoming difficult to maintain. Opportunities to charge 
visitors for appropriate services to help compensate for these 
costs are being considered as one solution. This is a sensitive 
matter, as free access for all people to the outdoors is a much 
cherished right. There is also an additional dilemma for public 
agencies where recreation facilities are already provided from 
public money, and it could be argued that the taxpayer is 
being charged twice. Thus, care is needed by public bodies to 
ensure that charges are only made for services that are clearly 
additional to the provision of free access.
① How to Use Public Facilities for Outdoor Activities
② Public Recreation Services: To Charge or Not?
③ Access to Public Facilities: Denied or Delayed?
④ A Short History of Public Recreation Facilities
⑤ Preserving the Landscape: Torn Between Two Demands
26. 밑줄 친 she[her]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Zaynab Fawwaz was born into a poor family in South 
Lebanon. As a young girl ① she went to Alexandria with the 
Egyptian family for whom she worked. Her mistress was 
intrigued by her maid’s native intelligence and introduced 
Zaynab to ② her literate friend, Fatima. She, in turn, taught 
her reading, writing and arithmetic. Zaynab quickly learned 
what ③ her teacher had to offer and in time went on to study 
with Egyptian scholars. Eventually, ④ she became very active 
in women’s issues and she wrote some pioneering poetry and 
essays focused on women’s rights. The most famous of ⑤ her 
essays was The Zaynab Letters.

Given that music appears to enhance physical and 
mental skills, are there circumstances where music is 
① damaging to performance? One domain ② which this is of 
considerable significance is music’s potentially damaging 
effects on the ability to drive safely. Evidence suggests an 
association between loud, fast music and reckless driving, but 
how might music’s ability to influence driving in this way 
③ be explained? One possibility is that drivers adjust to 
temporal regularities in music, and ④ that their speed is 
influenced accordingly. In other words, just as faster music 
causes people to eat faster, ⑤ so it causes people to drive at 
faster speeds, as they engage mentally and physically with 
ongoing repeated structures in the music.

적절한 것은?
England’s plan to establish colonies in North America, 
starting in the late sixteenth century, was founded on a 
(A) false / valid idea. It was generally assumed that Virginia, 
the region of the North American continent to which 
England laid claim, would have the same climate as the 
Mediterranean region of Europe, since it lay at similar 
latitudes. As a result, the English hoped that the American 
colonies, once established, would be able to supply 
Mediterranean goods such as olives and fruit and reduce England’s 
(B) dependence / restriction on imports from continental Europe. 
One prospectus claimed that the colonies would provide “the 
wines, fruit and salt of France and Spain ... the silks of Persia 
and Italy.” Similarly, (C) abundant / scarce timber would do 
away with the need to import wood from Scandinavia. In 
short, America was mistakenly expected to be a land of plenty 
that would quickly turn a profit.
* latitude: 위도  ** prospectus: 사업 설명서, 투자 설명서
(A) (B) (C)
① false …… dependence …… abundant
② false …… dependence …… scarce
③ false …… restriction …… abundant
④ valid …… restriction …… scarce
⑤ valid …… restriction …… abundant

The above graph shows the comparison between the 
allocated budget and actual spending for six departments at 
Triton Ventures in 2012. ① The Customer Service department 
was allocated 60,000 dollars, which was greater than the 
amount allocated to any other department. ② On the other 
hand, in terms of actual spending, the top two departments 
that spent the most were Marketing and Development. ③ The 
Customer Service and Information Technology departments 
spent the same amount of money, which was 20,000 dollars. 
④ The actual spending by the Administration department was 
less than half the allocated budget. ⑤ The Sales department 
showed the largest gap between the allocated budget and its 
actual spending among the six departments.
30. Georgia O’Keeffe에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
In her art, Georgia O’Keeffe clearly showed a pioneering 
spirit and an intensely individual style. At age twenty-seven, 
while teaching art in South Carolina, O’Keeffe began a series 
of simple, abstract charcoal drawings that expressed her own 
ideas and feelings. She sent these drawings to a friend in New 
York, who showed them to Alfred Stieglitz, the owner of the 
influential gallery 291. Stieglitz hailed them as the “purest, 
finest, sincerest things.” O’Keeffe’s greatest source of 
inspiration was nature. Her best-known paintings are large, 
extreme close-ups of flowers; the simplified and magnified 
views compel us to look at them in a new way and to discover 
their inner essence. At the same time, the paintings become 
abstract arrangements of color and line, light and shadow. 
While in New Mexico, she was also fascinated by the simple 
geometric grace of adobe churches and the majesty of the 
desert.
* adobe: 흙을 재료로 한 건축 양식의 일종
① 27세에 South Carolina에서 미술을 가르쳤다.
② 자신의 드로잉 작품들을 Stieglitz에게 보냈다.
③ 영감을 얻은 가장 큰 원천은 자연이었다.
④ 가장 잘 알려진 그림들은 클로즈업한 꽃 그림이다.
⑤ New Mexico에서 사막의 장엄함에 매료되었다.

31. Appearance creates the first impression customers have of 
food, and first impressions are important. No matter how 
appealing the taste, an unattractive appearance is hard to 
overlook. As humans, we do “eat with our eyes” because our 
sense of sight is more highly developed than the other senses. 
The sense of sight is so highly developed in humans that 
messages received from other senses are often ignored if they 
conflict with what is seen. Yellow candy is expected to be 
lemon-flavored, and if it is grape-flavored, many people 
. Strawberry 
ice cream tinted with red food coloring seems to have a 
stronger strawberry flavor than one that has no added food 
coloring, even when there is no real difference.
① cannot correctly identify the flavor
② will not favor the grape-flavored candy
③ can clearly sense the difference in flavor
④ will be instantly attracted to the grape flavor
⑤ will enjoy the subtle difference between them
32. The Rust Belt is notorious for its poor air quality. For 
decades, coal plants, steel production, and auto emissions 
have pumped particulates like sulfate into the atmosphere over 
the eastern U.S. Especially before air quality laws began 
appearing in the 1970s, particulate pollution was behind acid 
rain, respiratory disease, and ozone depletion. But a new study 
from Harvard University suggests that the Rust Belt’s thick 
particulate fog may have helped slow down the effects of 
climate change, particularly when it was thickest. Throughout 
the 20th century, global temperatures have gone up by just 
under one degree Celsius. But in the U.S., eastern and central 
states haven’t seen the same rise. In fact, temperatures there 
actually decreased over the same period. The reason seems to 
be particulate pollution. Instead of trapping warm air in the 
atmosphere like carbon dioxide, fine particles like sulfate 
reflect the sun’s light and heat. They may even group with 
watery cloud droplets, which do the same thing. The effect 
is .
* particulate: 분진, 미립 물질
① an accumulation of carbon dioxide
② a net cooling across entire regions
③ a steep acceleration of global warming
④ a significant improvement in air quality 
⑤ a slow but steady increase in temperatures

33. Suppose a survivor from an airplane crash with severe 
injuries struggles for days through the jungle but dies just 
before reaching a village. It is tempting to think “if only he had 
managed to walk to the village, he would have been rescued.” 
But suppose you must try to console the victim’s relatives. 
What might you say? Or suppose you wish to defend the 
rescue team who got as far as the village but no further. 
Your motivation to console or defend may influence the 
alternative you imagine. You may decide to emphasize the 
severity of the victim’s injuries and suggest “even if he had 
managed to walk to the village, he still would have died.” 
Sometimes thoughts about what might have been change an 
antecedent event (the victim walked to the village) but leave 
the outcome unchanged (he still died). “Even if...” 
conditionals have been called “semifactual” because they 
combine a counterfactual antecedent and a factual consequence. 
Imagined semifactual alternatives are intriguing because, 
unlike other thoughts about what might have been, they 
suggest that .  [3점]
① the consequence is unimaginable
② the antecedent is inevitable 
③ the outcome is inevitable
④ the antecedent is unpredictable
⑤ the consequence is unpredictable
34. The so-called Mozart effect― listening to Mozart will 
make your child smarter ― is a good example of 
by the media 
through hype not warranted by the research. It all started when 
researchers reported that after exposure to a selection of 
Mozart’s music, college students showed an increase in spatial 
reasoning for about 10 minutes on tasks like putting together 
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Note first that the research was done 
on college students, not infants, and that the effect was very 
brief. In addition, no one’s been able to replicate the research. 
The increase in spatial reasoning, it turns out, can be generated 
by any auditory stimulation (e.g., listening to a short story or 
other types of music) that keeps people alert while being tested. 
However, none of this has stopped eager parents― spurred on 
by fantastic claims from unethical companies― from 
purchasing Mozart CDs for their babies. [3점]
* hype: 과대 광고(선전)
① the bond between parents and children exaggerated
② a genuine scientific innovation being discarded
③ a scientific finding being distorted
④ the correlation between reasoning and music being rejected
⑤ the convergence of music and physiology made possible
35. As the structures of our world and the conditions of 
certainty have yielded to an avalanche of change, the 
extent of our longing for stable, definitive leadership 
. The fault 
lies not with leadership but rather with ourselves and our 
expectations. In the old days, leaders were supposed to 
make sense of chaos, to make certainty out of doubt, and 
to create positive action plans for the resolution of 
paradoxes. Good leaders straightened things out. Should 
chaos rear its ugly head, the leader was expected to restore 
normality immediately. But chaos is now considered 
normal, paradoxes cannot be resolved, and certainty is 
possible only to the level of high probability. Leadership 
that attempts to deliver in terms of fixing any of these can 
only fail. And that is exactly what is happening. [3점]
* an avalanche of: 많은, 쇄도하는
① can only be measured by our will to establish it
② has made traditional leadership more irreplaceable
③ can create viable action plans for restoring normality
④ has vastly reduced the probability of resolving paradoxes
⑤ has been exceeded only by the impossibility of finding it

36. When a company comes out with a new product, its 
competitors typically go on the defensive, doing whatever 
they can to (A)  the odds that the offering will eat 
into their sales. Responses might include increasing marketing 
efforts, offering discounts to channel partners, and even 
lobbying for regulations that would hinder the rival’s 
expansion. In many cases, though, such actions are misguided. 
Although the conventional wisdom that a rival’s launch will 
hurt profits is often correct, my research shows that 
companies sometimes see profits increase after a rival’s 
launch. The underlying mechanism is pretty simple: When a 
company comes out with a new product, it often raises the 
prices of its existing products. This might be designed to 
make the new product look (B)  and thus more 
attractive by comparison. As that company adjusts its pricing, 
its competitors can do the same without risking customer 
defections over price. [3점]
* defection: 이탈
(A) (B)
① calculate …… exceptional
② calculate …… more striking
③ eliminate …… more upgraded
④ reduce …… up-to-date
⑤ reduce …… cheaper

37. All human societies have economic systems within which 
goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed. 
In one sense, the economic aspect of culture is simply the sum 
of the choices people make regarding these areas of their 
lives. These choices critically determine much of people’s 
lives. (A) , choosing to become a farmer rather 
than an insurance broker may determine where you live, who 
you are likely to meet, the sorts of behaviors you will expect 
in your spouse and offspring, and so on. However, such 
choices are not unlimited; rather, they are limited by our 
cultures, traditions, and technologies. (B) , our 
environments set the boundaries within which choices about 
the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and 
services are made. To the extent that economic systems are 
part of culture, people in different cultures have different sorts 
of economic behavior.
(A) (B)
① By contrast …… Consequently
② For example …… Conversely
③ For example …… Furthermore
④ Similarly …… Instead
⑤ Similarly …… Nevertheless

Organic farmers grow crops that are no less plagued by 
pests than those of conventional farmers; insects generally 
do not discriminate between organic and conventional as 
well as we do.
(A) However, most organic farmers have no choice but to rely 
on chemicals as necessary supplements to their operations. 
With pests often consuming up to 40 percent of the crops 
grown in the United States, they do so as a matter of 
course. 
(B) They might refer to these substances as “botanical 
extracts.” But according to Ned Groth, a senior scientist 
at Consumers Union, these toxins “are not necessarily 
less worrisome because they are natural.”
(C) It is true that they are far more likely than conventional 
farmers to practice environmentally beneficial forms of 
biological control, and that they are also more likely to 
sensibly diversify their crops to reduce infestation. 
* infestation: 횡행, 만연

But the ones in which he could get up and do things like 
industrial arts, drama, science projects, or P.E. were always 
his favorites.
Jason always seemed to have a tough time in classes, except 
in the ones where he could do something. In the classes in 
which the teachers just stood and talked, or told everyone to 
read, he seemed to get bored and restless. ( ① ) He soon 
realized that he was not a slow or unmotivated learner; he was 
a kinesthetic learner. ( ② ) Once he figured this out, he 
started to use this information to his advantage. ( ③ ) He 
would draw out what he learned from class on notes, posters, 
and doodles. ( ④ ) He would act out things and work with 
other students on projects using role play and drama. ( ⑤ ) 
This helped his learning come alive, and he was less bored. As 
a result, he not only enjoyed school more, but his grades also 
went up.

A narrative is not a myth the first time it is told, but only a 
story or an account. What makes a story a myth is the fact 
that it is received by a given society and that a given society 
participates in its transmission. Obviously, it is difficult to 
determine just when any story becomes a myth, but it is 
clear that a narrative is not a myth when it is first told. The 
intentions of the first narrator and the last narrator can be 
the same, but this still does not give any special status to the 
creator of a myth. It is far more important to realize that the 
intentions of a given society in transmitting a narrative may 
have nothing to do with the purposes of its author. Thus we 
can never identify any individual creator of a myth. So long 
as myth is a collective narrative by definition, the only 
relevant consideration are the mentality and purposes of the 
society for which the myth is a myth.
󰀻
Given the (A)  nature of a myth, a narrative becomes 
a myth only when a given society accepts and (B)  it, 
regardless of the intentions of its author.
(A) (B)
① collective …… transmits
② creative …… distributes
③ mental …… modernizes
④ primitive …… circulates
⑤ social …… evaluates

Carrying capacity is the number of individuals that the 
local resources can sustain. Individuals in a population that 
has exceeded the carrying capacity of its habitat may have 
poor health and suffer from malnutrition because of the 
compromised living conditions. When this happens, the 
weakest individuals may die, or the population as a whole 
may become more vulnerable to further environmental stress 
or disease. Sometimes a large number of individuals in a 
population die as a result of overshooting the carrying 
capacity of their habitat. This is known as a die-off. 
Certain animals and plants have a built-in sense of 
carrying capacity, so that instead of overshooting and having 
a die-off, they remain within the limits of their habitat’s 
ability to support them. Lake trout, for instance, stop 
breeding as prolifically when the population density 
increases too dramatically. Although this is the result of 
individual responses to chemical signals from other trout 
rather than a thought-out response on the part of the trout, 
the result is that population numbers may  
for extended periods. The trout will produce more offspring 
and mature to a reproductive size at a faster rate when 
populations are threatened, such as when aggressive fishing 
takes place. When space and food are scarce, such as when a 
lot of fish are living together in a small pond, the trout 
remain smaller and reproduce more slowly. Experiments 
have shown that no matter what number of lake trout a pond 
is stocked with in the beginning, the population will increase 
until it reaches a particular density, then level off at about the 
same number.
* prolific: 다산(多産)의

(A)
In Australia a few years ago, I met a remarkable man 
named John Walton. He has since become a close friend. He 
told me that when he started out in life he seemed to be 
caught in a peculiar failure pattern. Whatever he tried would 
start out well and then end up badly. As a schoolboy he 
dropped out of several schools for this reason. He became 
convinced that it was his destiny in life to make good 
beginnings and then watch them fade away. 
(B)
The speaker also said, “Most of you are letting the fear of 
failure hold you back. All the ingredients of success are right 
there inside you, if you’ll just turn your thinking around. 
Don’t keep telling yourself you can’t do this or you can’t do 
that. You can do ANYTHING if you think you can!” John 
had never heard anything like this in his whole life. He 
realized for the first time that his image of himself as a 
person who started well and then faded away was all in his 
head, a state of mind that could be altered any time he made 
a firm decision to alter it.
(C)
At one point, John got a job with the Australian division of a 
famous American company. The same dreary pattern seemed 
to be unfolding: He started out well, and then things began to 
slide. This didn’t surprise him much; it was what he expected 
to happen. Then the company sent a motivational speaker out 
to give some talks to their Australian employees, and John 
was in the audience. The visitor told his listeners to visualize 
themselves moving up in the company, receiving promotions, 
gaining energy as they went, right up to the very top.
(D)
John went back to work with tremendous enthusiasm and 
confidence and energy. He received promotions. He became 
the manager of a branch in New South Wales. Finally he 
became the head of the company for all of Australia. Where 
once he had been dogged by failure, now everything he did 
was crowned by success. He told me, “It was that one talk 
that changed my self-image by giving it a little twist. It made 
me see myself differently, and so I was different.”
