In her art, Georgia O’Keeffe clearly showed a pioneering 
spirit and an intensely individual style. At age twenty-seven, 
while teaching art in South Carolina, O’Keeffe began a series 
of simple, abstract charcoal drawings that expressed her own 
ideas and feelings. She sent these drawings to a friend in New 
York, who showed them to Alfred Stieglitz, the owner of the 
influential gallery 291. Stieglitz hailed them as the “purest, 
finest, sincerest things.” O’Keeffe’s greatest source of 
inspiration was nature. Her best-known paintings are large, 
extreme close-ups of flowers; the simplified and magnified 
views compel us to look at them in a new way and to discover 
their inner essence. At the same time, the paintings become 
abstract arrangements of color and line, light and shadow. 
While in New Mexico, she was also fascinated by the simple 
geometric grace of adobe churches and the majesty of the 
desert.
