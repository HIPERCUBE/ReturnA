37. All human societies have economic systems within which 
goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed. 
In one sense, the economic aspect of culture is simply the sum 
of the choices people make regarding these areas of their 
lives. These choices critically determine much of people’s 
lives. (A) , choosing to become a farmer rather 
than an insurance broker may determine where you live, who 
you are likely to meet, the sorts of behaviors you will expect 
in your spouse and offspring, and so on. However, such 
choices are not unlimited; rather, they are limited by our 
cultures, traditions, and technologies. (B) , our 
environments set the boundaries within which choices about 
the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and 
services are made. To the extent that economic systems are 
part of culture, people in different cultures have different sorts 
of economic behavior.
