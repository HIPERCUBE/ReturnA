Given that music appears to enhance physical and 
mental skills, are there circumstances where music is 
① damaging to performance? One domain ② which this is of 
considerable significance is music’s potentially damaging 
effects on the ability to drive safely. Evidence suggests an 
association between loud, fast music and reckless driving, but 
how might music’s ability to influence driving in this way 
③ be explained? One possibility is that drivers adjust to 
temporal regularities in music, and ④ that their speed is 
influenced accordingly. In other words, just as faster music 
causes people to eat faster, ⑤ so it causes people to drive at 
faster speeds, as they engage mentally and physically with 
ongoing repeated structures in the music.
