34. The so-called Mozart effect― listening to Mozart will 
make your child smarter ― is a good example of 
by the media 
through hype not warranted by the research. It all started when 
researchers reported that after exposure to a selection of 
Mozart’s music, college students showed an increase in spatial 
reasoning for about 10 minutes on tasks like putting together 
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Note first that the research was done 
on college students, not infants, and that the effect was very 
brief. In addition, no one’s been able to replicate the research. 
The increase in spatial reasoning, it turns out, can be generated 
by any auditory stimulation (e.g., listening to a short story or 
other types of music) that keeps people alert while being tested. 
However, none of this has stopped eager parents― spurred on 
by fantastic claims from unethical companies― from 
purchasing Mozart CDs for their babies. [3점]
