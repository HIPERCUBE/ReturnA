injuries struggles for days through the jungle but dies just 
before reaching a village. It is tempting to think “if only he had

What might you say? Or suppose you wish to defend the 
rescue team who got as far as the village but no further. 
Your motivation to console or defend may influence the

severity of the victim’s injuries and suggest “even if he had 
managed to walk to the village, he still would have died.” 
Sometimes thoughts about what might have been change an

the outcome unchanged (he still died). “Even if...” 
conditionals have been called “semifactual” because they 
combine a counterfactual antecedent and a factual consequence. 
Imagined semifactual alternatives are intriguing because, 
unlike other thoughts about what might have been, they 
suggest that .  [3점]
