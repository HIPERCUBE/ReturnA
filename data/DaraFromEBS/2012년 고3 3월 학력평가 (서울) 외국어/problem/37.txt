37. ‘The object’에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
In 1898, a peculiar six-inch wooden object was found in a
tomb in Egypt. ‘The object’ had a body, seven-inch wings
that curved downward slightly, a fixed rudder, and a tail. It
looked very much like a modern airplane. But as airplanes
had not yet been invented in 1898, it was labeled as a
model of a bird and just stored away in the basement of the
Cairo Museum. In 1969, the object was rediscovered by Dr.
Khalil Messiha, an authority on ancient models. According to
him and to other researchers, it has characteristics of very
advanced aerodynamics. The curved wings can attain great
amounts of lift, and a similar design is employed on the
Concorde aircraft. Was this just a child’s toy? Or was it a
scale model of an aircraft the Egyptians planned to build...
or built? Even if they did build a full-scale version of the
aircraft, no evidence exists of it.
