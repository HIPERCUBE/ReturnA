You can learn the success secrets of the greatest people
who ever lived. The lives of famous people have been
recorded in biographies and are ready for you to read and
research. The lives of great government leaders,
businesspeople, and humanitarians are there. You will read
about successes and triumphs. You will also learn how many
times champions lose on their way to winning. In reading
biographies, you may come to the startling conclusion that
you are not very different from those great people. You may
conclude, “Hey, I can do that.” You can make your life
significant. Biographies help show the way. You only have to
go to the library, bookstores, or surf the Internet.
