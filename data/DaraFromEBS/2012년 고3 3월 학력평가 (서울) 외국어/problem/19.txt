Nineteenth-century inventors often found themselves
cheated and spent much of their lives fighting costly
court battles. Consider the fate of poor Elias Howe. In
1846, ① this young Boston native produced the first
workable sewing machine. The trouble was that no one
wanted it. Depressed by his failure, Howe traveled to
England, where ② he hoped that the invention might be
given a warmer reception. It was not. After two terrible
years, ③ the frustrated inventor had to work his passage
home on a merchant ship. Arriving penniless in Boston, he
discovered that in his absence a man called Isaac Singer
had stolen ④ his patent and set up a sewing machine
factory. Howe took Singer to court, where two things
became clear: Singer was a thief, but ⑤ he was so rich that
he could afford to hire the sharpest lawyers. It was only
after a lengthy fight that Howe could get royalties from
Singer.
