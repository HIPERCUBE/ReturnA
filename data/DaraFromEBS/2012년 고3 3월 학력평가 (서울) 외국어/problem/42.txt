42. Some people work long hours even at very high levels of
income. Have they got their priorities right? Most people
would agree that, at a low level of income, an increase in
income is likely to improve your quality of life, even if it
means longer working hours. At this level, even if you have
to work longer in your factory, higher income is likely to
bring a higher overall quality of life by improving your
health through better food, heating, hygiene and healthcare
and by reducing the physical demands of household work
through more household appliances. However, above a certain
level of income, the relative value of material consumption
in relation to leisure time is diminished, so earning a higher
income at the cost of working longer hours may reduce the
quality of your life.
