23. The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as 
you wish. When you can do this without having to force 
people or hurt them, when they willingly grant you what you 
desire, then your power is untouchable. The best way to 
achieve this position is to create a relationship of dependence. 
The master requires your services; he is weak, or unable to 
function without you; you have involved yourself in his work 
so deeply that doing away with you would bring him great 
difficulty, or at least would mean valuable time lost in 
training another to replace you. Once such a relationship is 
established, you have the upper hand to make the master do 
as you wish. It is the classic case of the servant of the king 
who actually __________ the king.
