26. Researchers have come to understand how the African village 
weaverbird prevents itself from being taken advantage of by 
cuckoos―it is all down to the speckles on the eggs. David Lahti 
and his colleagues have described how village weaverbirds lay 
eggs which all show a very similar pattern of speckles, suggesting 
that if a cuckoo laid an egg in the nest, the weaverbird will 
be able to spot the foreign egg almost immediately. But when 
the researchers studied two colonies of the birds that had been 
introduced more than 200 years ago to two islands without any 
cuckoos, they found that those birds’ eggs no longer exhibited 
the same speckle patterns. In a neat demonstration of the power 
of evolution, these results show how, in the absence of pressure 
from parasitic cuckoos, the appearance of the eggs has altered 
because ________________________________________.  [3점]

① nest building instincts are determined by genetic factors
② having a similar pattern is no longer so much of an advantage
③ invasions by cuckoos have forced the birds to become strong
④ adapting to a new environment takes a certain amount of time
⑤ their unique speckle patterns attracted too many enemies
