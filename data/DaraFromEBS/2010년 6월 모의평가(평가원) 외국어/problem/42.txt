42. If you compare a walnut with some of the beautiful and 
exciting things that grow on our planet, it does not seem to 
be a marvelous creation. It is common, rough, not 
particularly attractive, and certainly not of much value. 
Besides, it is small. Its growth is limited by the hard shell 
that surrounds it―the shell from which it never escapes 
during its lifetime. Of course, that is the wrong way to judge 
a walnut. Break one open and look inside. See how the 
walnut has grown to fill every corner available to it. It had 
no say in the size or shape of that shell. However, given 
those limitations, it achieved its full growth. How lucky we 
will be if, like the walnut, we blossom and bloom in every 
aspect of the life that is given us. Take heart! If one nut can 
do it, so can you.
