33. One of the most potentially productive trends in education 
today is the focus on interdisciplinary studies: teaching math 
as it applies to science, for example, or relating the various 
humanities. This applies to art education, too. If we trivialize 
art and remove it from the core of a mainstream education, we 
not only deny our students full access to one of humankind’s 
most profound experiences, but we miss countless opportunities 
to improve their grasp of other subjects as well. Moreover, we 
deny students access to an extremely useful kind of training 
and a productive mode of thought. We should also consider that 
the more legitimately we weave art into the fabric of the 
general curriculum, the better our students will understand the 
important role art plays in culture.
