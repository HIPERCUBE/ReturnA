24. If you were a butterfly, would you be attracted to a more 
colorful flower or a less colorful one? Most of you would 
probably prefer the more colorful option. The same is true 
for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. For years, 
biologists have known that flowers use striking colors, 
scents, elaborately shaped petals, and nectar to attract 
pollinators. Recent studies, however, reveal another powerful 
tool of attraction used by flowers: ____________________. 
Scientists have discovered that mobile flowers are visited 
more often by pollinating insects than their more static 
counterparts. It is almost as if the flowers are waving to the 
insects, saying, “Welcome. Come here and have a drink.” 
Along with this interesting finding, scientists have also 
concluded that, due to their greater range of motion, flowers 
with long, thin stalks attract more insects.
