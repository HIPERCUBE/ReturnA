I have seen people who are very good at their jobs but are 
poor at presenting themselves and, hence, do not convince 
the audience of their capabilities. Presentation is so crucially 
important and will make the difference between getting a 
sale or not. Some people are naturally good presenters, but 
brushing up on your skills in this area will prove profitable. 
There are lots of courses available that are good. Try Think 
Business where courses are cheap or even free. The ABC 
Marketing Institute also offers very good presentation skills 
courses. A good course will help you structure your 
presentations and improve your own personal style. I would 
recommend one that films you while you are presenting and 
then gives a critique of your style.
① 대인 관계 개선 방안을 제시하려고
② 프레젠테이션 소프트웨어를 광고하려고
③ 청중과의 상호 작용의 중요성을 강조하려고
④ 영상 매체를 활용한 강의 기법을 설명하려고
⑤ 발표력 향상을 위한 강좌에 대해 알려 주려고
19. 밑줄 친 he[him]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? 
John was as famous for his tennis skills as he was for his 
fits of temper on the court. One afternoon, I was playing an 
important singles match against John. When things didn’t go 
his way, ① he began to go downhill, complaining about the 
game, screaming at himself, and slamming his racket. It 
looked like ② he was having a public nervous breakdown. 
In the end, the guy who didn’t “deserve to be on the same 
court” with ③ him won in three tough sets. After the match, 
John announced his retirement from tennis at the age of 
twenty seven. He explained, “When I start losing to players 
like ④ him, I’ve got to reconsider what I’m doing even 
playing this game.” If he thought I’d be insulted, ⑤ he was 
wrong. In fact, I loved it.
20. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? 
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, 
had a great sense of delicacy ① where other persons’ feelings 
were concerned. He once paid a visit to George Meredith, 
the novelist, when Meredith was old and weak. Meredith 
suffered from an unusual disease that caused him ② to fall 
occasionally. The two men were walking up a path toward 
Meredith’s summerhouse, Conan Doyle in the lead, when 
Conan Doyle heard the old novelist fall behind him. He 
judged by the sound ③ which the fall was a mere slip and 
could not have hurt Meredith. Therefore, he did not turn and 
he strode on as if he ④ had heard nothing. “He was a 
fiercely proud old man,” Conan Doyle later explained, “and 
my instincts told me that his humiliation in being helped up 
would be ⑤ far greater than any relief I could give him.”

There is an old Japanese legend about a man renowned for 
his flawless manners visiting a remote village. Wanting to 
honor as well as observe him, the villagers prepared a 
banquet. As they sat to eat, all eyes were on their noble 
guest. Everyone looked at (A) what / how the man held his 
chopsticks, so that they could imitate him. But then, by an 
unfortunate accident, as the mannered man raised a slippery 
slice of tofu to his lips, he (B) placed / was placed the 
tiniest bit of excess pressure on his chopsticks, propelling 
his tofu through the air and onto his neighbor’s lap. After a 
brief moment of surprise, in order to preserve the myth of 
their guest’s perfection and keep (C) him / himself from any 
embarrassment, all the villagers at the banquet began to fling 
tofu into each other’s laps.
(A) (B) (C)
① what …… placed …… him
② what …… was placed …… himself
③ how …… placed …… him
④ how …… placed …… himself
⑤ how …… was placed …… himself
22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
The famous expression, “Keep your friends close, but keep 
your enemies even closer,” was exemplified well in Nelson 
Mandela’s attempt to learn Afrikaans, the language of his 
enemy. ① Mandela first began to learn the language of the 
Afrikaners, the white South Africans, in the 1960’s to the 
disapproval of his followers. ② They thought it was a waste 
of time, but Mandela felt that it was crucial for gaining insight 
into the world view of the Afrikaners. ③ By obtaining this 
perspective of how the Afrikaners looked at the world, he 
would be able to understand their strengths and weaknesses. 
④ In many ways, Mandela’s greatest contribution as president 
of the South Africans including the Afrikaners was the way 
he chose to leave the presidency. ⑤ This understanding of the 
Afrikaners proved to be invaluable later in successfully 
persuading them to accept his people’s demands.

23. The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as 
you wish. When you can do this without having to force 
people or hurt them, when they willingly grant you what you 
desire, then your power is untouchable. The best way to 
achieve this position is to create a relationship of dependence. 
The master requires your services; he is weak, or unable to 
function without you; you have involved yourself in his work 
so deeply that doing away with you would bring him great 
difficulty, or at least would mean valuable time lost in 
training another to replace you. Once such a relationship is 
established, you have the upper hand to make the master do 
as you wish. It is the classic case of the servant of the king 
who actually __________ the king.
① controls ② avoids ③ admires
④ rescues ⑤ entertains
24. If you were a butterfly, would you be attracted to a more 
colorful flower or a less colorful one? Most of you would 
probably prefer the more colorful option. The same is true 
for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. For years, 
biologists have known that flowers use striking colors, 
scents, elaborately shaped petals, and nectar to attract 
pollinators. Recent studies, however, reveal another powerful 
tool of attraction used by flowers: ____________________. 
Scientists have discovered that mobile flowers are visited 
more often by pollinating insects than their more static 
counterparts. It is almost as if the flowers are waving to the 
insects, saying, “Welcome. Come here and have a drink.” 
Along with this interesting finding, scientists have also 
concluded that, due to their greater range of motion, flowers 
with long, thin stalks attract more insects.
* pollinator: 꽃가루 매개자
① moving in the wind ② fancy color scheme
③ unique tasting nectar ④ having deep roots
⑤ receiving vocal messages
25. A brilliant friend of mine once told me, “When you 
suddenly see a problem, something happens that you have the 
answer―before you are able to put it into words. It is all 
done subconsciously. This has happened many times to me.” 
This feeling of knowing ____________________________ is 
common. The French philosopher and mathematician Blaise 
Pascal is famous for saying, “The heart has its reasons 
that reason cannot know.” The great nineteenth-century 
mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss also admitted that 
intuition often led him to ideas he could not immediately 
prove. He said, “I have had my results for a long time; but 
I do not yet know how I am to arrive at them.” Fittingly so, 
sometimes true genius simply cannot be put into words.
① the meaning of the feelings in your heart
② without being able to say how one knows
③ the way others solve the problems they face
④ how to use the right words to persuade others
⑤ someone that you have never met before in your life
26. Researchers have come to understand how the African village 
weaverbird prevents itself from being taken advantage of by 
cuckoos―it is all down to the speckles on the eggs. David Lahti 
and his colleagues have described how village weaverbirds lay 
eggs which all show a very similar pattern of speckles, suggesting 
that if a cuckoo laid an egg in the nest, the weaverbird will 
be able to spot the foreign egg almost immediately. But when 
the researchers studied two colonies of the birds that had been 
introduced more than 200 years ago to two islands without any 
cuckoos, they found that those birds’ eggs no longer exhibited 
the same speckle patterns. In a neat demonstration of the power 
of evolution, these results show how, in the absence of pressure 
from parasitic cuckoos, the appearance of the eggs has altered 
because ________________________________________.  [3점]
* speckle: 얼룩, 반점    ** parasitic: 기생하는
① nest building instincts are determined by genetic factors
② having a similar pattern is no longer so much of an advantage
③ invasions by cuckoos have forced the birds to become strong
④ adapting to a new environment takes a certain amount of time
⑤ their unique speckle patterns attracted too many enemies
27. Why don’t we think differently more often? The reason is 
that we do not need to be creative for most of what we do. 
For example, we do not need to be creative when we are 
driving on the freeway, or riding in an elevator, or waiting in 
line at a grocery store. ________________________ when it 
comes to the business of living. For most of our activities, 
these routines are indispensable. Without them, our lives 
would be in chaos, and we would not get much accomplished. 
If you got up this morning and started contemplating the 
shape of your toothbrush or questioning the meaning of toast, 
you probably would not make it to work.
① We are creatures of habit
② Social restrictions do not apply
③ We pay more attention to safety
④ Personal accomplishments do matter
⑤ Creative thinking is highly recommended
28. In Chinese food, the idea is that it should be boiling hot, 
because that is crucial to its flavor, embodied in the phrase 
wok hei, which means the ‘breath’ or essence of the 
combination of tastes added by a hot wok. In 2005 Belgian 
researchers at Leuven University confirmed just how the 
link between temperature and taste works. They identified 
microscopic channels in our taste buds, which seem to 
respond differently at different temperatures. Apparently, the 
higher the temperature, the more intense the flavor. This is 
why _____________________________________________, 
which is why ice cream makers add stacks of sugar―as you 
can tell all too clearly when ice cream melts. In a similar 
way, some bitter tastes, like tea, taste better when hot 
because they are more intense.
* wok: 중국 요리용 냄비
① ice cream tastes better when tea flavors are added
② ice cream does not taste that sweet straight from the fridge
③ they serve ice cream for dessert in Chinese restaurants
④ it is not recommended to eat ice cream while drinking hot tea
⑤ ice cream tastes sweeter especially in the winter time
29. Unlike the novel, short story, or play, film is not handy to 
study; it cannot be effectively frozen on the printed page. 
The novel and short story are relatively easy to study because 
they are written to be read. The stage play is slightly more 
difficult to study because it is written to be performed. But 
plays are printed, and because they rely heavily on the 
spoken word, imaginative readers can create at least a pale 
imitation of the experience they might have watching a 
performance on stage. This cannot be said of the screenplay, 
for a film depends greatly on visual and other nonverbal 
elements that are not easily expressed in writing. The 
screenplay requires so much filling in by our imagination that 
we cannot really approximate the experience of a film by 
reading a screenplay, and reading a screenplay is worthwhile 
only if we have already seen the film. Thus, most screenplays  
. [3점]

① rely more on the spoken word than stage plays
② attract a much wider readership than short stories
③ do share many elements with other literary genres
④ are popular though it requires extra effort to study them
⑤ are published not to be read but rather to be remembered
30. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Every writer is starting from a different point and is 
bound for a different destination. Yet many writers are 
paralyzed by the thought that they are competing with 
everybody else who is trying to write and presumably 
doing it better. This can often happen in a writing class. 
Inexperienced students are chilled to find themselves in the 
same class with students whose articles have appeared in 
the college newspaper. But writing for the college paper is 
no great credit; I have often found that the hares who write 
for the paper are overtaken by the tortoises who move 
studiously toward the goal of mastering the craft. The same 
fear hangs around freelance writers, who see the work of 
other writers appearing in magazines while their own keeps 
returning in the mail. Forget the competition and go at 
your own pace.
① 글쓰기를 두려워하지 마라.
② 글을 빨리 쓸 수 있도록 연습하라.
③ 대학 시절에 다작하는 습관을 형성하라.
④ 경쟁 의식을 버리고 소신껏 글쓰기를 하라.
⑤ 좋은 글을 쓰는 연습을 통해 인성을 함양하라.
31. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 
않은 것은?
The traditional American view was that fences were out 
of place in the American landscape. This notion turned up 
① repeatedly in nineteenth-century American writing about 
the landscape. One author after another severely ② criticized 
“the Englishman’s insultingly inhospitable brick wall topped 
with broken bottles.” Frank J. Scott, an early landscape 
architect who had a large impact on the look of America’s 
first suburbs, worked tirelessly to ③ rid the landscape of 
fences. Writing in 1870, he held that to narrow our neighbors’ 
views of the free graces of Nature was ④ unselfish and 
undemocratic. To drive through virtually any American suburb 
today, where every lawn steps right up to the street in a 
gesture of ⑤ openness and welcoming, is to see how 
completely such views have triumphed.

적절한 것은?
A case of the negative impact of an innovation was reported 
by a researcher examining the spread of the snowmobile among 
the Skolt Lapps in northern Finland. The snowmobile offered 
considerable relative advantages to the Lapps who used reindeer 
sleds as their primary means of transportation. It was much 
faster, making trips for supplies more efficient. However, the 
snowmobile had (A) beneficial / disastrous effects on the Lapps. 
First, the noise of the snowmobile frightened the reindeer, who 
in turn exhibited health problems and produced fewer calves 
each year. Herd sizes were (B) reduced / increased further by 
herders who sold some of their reindeer to buy a snowmobile. 
With smaller herds, the Lapps found it more difficult to survive, 
and the snowmobile was eventually viewed as a product that 
drove the Lapps into (C) poverty / wealth .
(A) (B) (C)
① beneficial …… reduced …… poverty
② disastrous …… reduced …… poverty
③ disastrous …… increased …… wealth
④ disastrous …… increased …… poverty
⑤ beneficial …… reduced …… wealth

33. One of the most potentially productive trends in education 
today is the focus on interdisciplinary studies: teaching math 
as it applies to science, for example, or relating the various 
humanities. This applies to art education, too. If we trivialize 
art and remove it from the core of a mainstream education, we 
not only deny our students full access to one of humankind’s 
most profound experiences, but we miss countless opportunities 
to improve their grasp of other subjects as well. Moreover, we 
deny students access to an extremely useful kind of training 
and a productive mode of thought. We should also consider that 
the more legitimately we weave art into the fabric of the 
general curriculum, the better our students will understand the 
important role art plays in culture.
① importance of early fine art education 
② necessity of integrating art in the curriculum
③ shortage of teaching materials in art education 
④ causes of decrease in the number of art classes 
⑤ results of interdisciplinary education in the humanities
34. Our love for another person pulls us out of ourselves 
and lifts our thoughts to a grander scale: How can I make 
the world better for this person? When I was young, the 
only love I experienced was the immature, selfish love of 
“I love her because she makes me feel good.” Now I think 
about the woman I love in terms of what she wants. I want 
to make her happy because I cannot be happy when she is 
unhappy. We discover that the act of giving true love is 
more powerful than getting the hug you need―if we can 
get over our own hunger for love, then we have reached 
the state of pure love, of being connected to a larger ideal, 
bigger than our own individual life.

① 사랑의 진정한 의미 ② 이타적 사랑의 한계
③ 유년기 사랑의 특성 ④ 감성과 이성의 조화
⑤ 사랑의 예술적 승화
35. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 문장은? 
The graph above shows the percentage of population growth 
and forest loss in the continents of the world since 1990. 
① Africa shows the highest percentage of population growth, 
whereas Europe shows the lowest percentage of population 
growth. ②Africa also shows the highest percentage of forest 
loss, followed by Latin America, Oceania, Asia and North 
America. ③ The only continent that exhibits a negative 
percentage in forest loss, which translates to forest gain, is 
Europe. ④ A point of note is that while Asia and Oceania 
have similar percentages of population growth, Oceania 
displays less forest loss than Asia. ⑤ Overall, there are only 
two continents whose percentage of forest loss is greater than 
five percent.
36. Jaisalmer에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은? 
Known as the Golden City, Jaisalmer, a former caravan 
center on the route to the Khyber Pass, rises from a sea of 
sand, its 30-foot-high walls and medieval sandstone fort 
sheltering palaces that soar into the sapphire sky. With its 
tiny winding lanes and hidden temples, Jaisalmer is straight 
out of The Arabian Nights. So little has the way of life 
altered here that it is easy to imagine yourself back in the 
13th century. It is the only fortress city in India still 
functioning, with one quarter of its population living within 
the walls. It is just far enough off the beaten path to have 
been spared damage from tourists. The city’s wealth 
originally came from the substantial tolls it placed on 
passing merchants.
① Khyber Pass의 한 가운데 위치하고 있다.
② 생활 방식에 많은 변화를 겪어 왔다.
③ 인구의 절반이 성벽 안에 살고 있다.
④ 관광객으로 인한 피해가 컸다.
⑤ 상인들에게 통행료를 부과했었다.
37. Sofonisba Anguissola에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 
않는 것은?
The best-known female artist of the sixteenth century, 
Sofonisba Anguissola, was born into a noble Italian family. 
Her mother died young, leaving her wealthy husband with five 
talented daughters. Unusual of the time, this liberal father gave 
his daughters a full classical education including painting. It 
was this enlightened attitude that enabled Anguissola to earn 
her own living as a portrait painter in the Spanish court and 
helped her to rise above the restrictions of her class and 
gender. In Three Sisters Playing Chess, Anguissola broke 
with tradition by concentrating on those scenes and models 
available to her, painting her sisters in a domestic setting. 
This gave the portrait an immediacy, which allowed the 
contemporary Italian art historian Vasari to attribute to her the 
development of the conversational portrait, as opposed to the 
formal frontal or profile portrait.
① 부유한 아버지와 재능있는 자매들이 있었다.
② 그림 그리기를 포함한 고전 교육을 받았다.
③ Spain  궁정의 초상화가로서 생계를 유지했다.
④ Three Sisters Playing Chess에 자신의 자매들을 그렸다.
⑤ 당대의 화가 Vasari와 함께 정면 초상화 발전에 기여했다.

38. Science, of course, is an indispensable source of 
information for the contemporary writer. It is, furthermore, a 
necessary part of his highly technological environment. Thus 
it is also an inevitable component of his sensibility and a 
decisive, even if often unrecognized, component of his creative 
imagination. But science is not in itself an elemental 
well-spring of literature. Even the most refined and precise 
research data are only raw materials which may or may not 
become literature. For whatever becomes a work of art of any 
kind does so as a result of an act of creation, an act of artistic 
composition, an act involving the art of make-believe. 
Scientific statements or remarks as such, even when they are 
valid, reliable, and comprehensive, are not literature. 
① 과학 기술은 문학 사조의 변천에 영향을 미친다.
② 과학 정보는 창조 행위를 통해서 문학이 될 수 있다.
③ 현대의 작가들은 폭넓은 과학적 상식을 갖추어야 한다.
④ 문학 작품은 과학적 탐구를 위한 강한 동기를 부여한다.
⑤ 과학과 문학은 기본적으로 상상력을 바탕으로 발전한다.
39. One of the common mistakes that employers make is 
looking at a team of employees as a homogeneous group that 
rises and falls together. Offering incentives, such as a group 
bonus or a vacation trip, to a team as a whole is not a smart 
managerial move because it fails to acknowledge who an 
individual is. For example, sending an entire team to Hawaii 
for a job well done actually discourages an employee’s efforts 
to do his best work. He only needs to perform well enough 
to help achieve the team objective. If, on the other hand, the 
employee knew that individual rewards were possible, he 
would be more likely to strive to outperform expectations. 
While teamwork is important within a corporation, management 
should come up with new compensation packages to help 
individuals to become champions.
* homogeneous: 동질적인

① 성취에 대한 보상은 일관된 기준에 따라야 한다.
② 다양한 배경을 지닌 구성원으로 팀을 구성해야 한다.
③ 개별적 보상을 통해 개개인의 역량을 신장시켜야 한다.
④ 팀워크 향상을 위해 관리자 연수를 강화할 필요가 있다.
⑤ 정기적인 휴가를 통해 업무의 효율을 꾀할 수 있다.

곳은?
Fortunately, one of the most sustained research programs 
in postwar musicology has succeeded in reconstructing their 
original sequence.
Beethoven took scraps of paper with him on his frequent 
walks, writing down his musical ideas as they came to him. 
( ① ) At home, he kept large sketchbooks into which he 
might copy the results or enter new ideas, fashioning and 
refashioning the music, crossing it out and starting again. 
( ② ) After Beethoven’s death these sketchbooks were 
scattered and in many cases broken up. ( ③ ) As a 
result, you can work through them and trace the painful 
process by which Beethoven edged toward the music that 
we know. ( ④ ) For instance, while the first section of 
the ‘Ode to Joy’ seems to have come to him with little 
difficulty, the middle section gave him enormous trouble; 
there is sketch upon sketch in which Beethoven tries one 
idea, then another. ( ⑤ ) And you find that the most 
characteristic and expressive features of the music come 
together only during the final stages of the compositional 
process.

41. Many theatergoers have been offered lots of good plays 
including West Side Story, The King and I, and Dracula for 
several decades. However, they have hardly ever seen new 
works recently because many producers have avoided making 
a new play. Part of the reason may be the tremendous cost 
of making a new production these days. It is true that many 
producers asked to invest a few hundred thousand dollars in 
a production have preferred a play of proven merit and past 
success to a new, untried play. That sounds like a reasonable 
excuse but, in fact, this practice can lead to an undesirable 
situation. Unless new plays are given a chance today, there 
will be nothing to revive in the future.

42. If you compare a walnut with some of the beautiful and 
exciting things that grow on our planet, it does not seem to 
be a marvelous creation. It is common, rough, not 
particularly attractive, and certainly not of much value. 
Besides, it is small. Its growth is limited by the hard shell 
that surrounds it―the shell from which it never escapes 
during its lifetime. Of course, that is the wrong way to judge 
a walnut. Break one open and look inside. See how the 
walnut has grown to fill every corner available to it. It had 
no say in the size or shape of that shell. However, given 
those limitations, it achieved its full growth. How lucky we 
will be if, like the walnut, we blossom and bloom in every 
aspect of the life that is given us. Take heart! If one nut can 
do it, so can you.

Jim performed fieldwork in Lesotho, a small nation 
in Africa. There, studying and interacting with local 
villagers, he patiently earned their trust until one day 
he was asked to join in one of their songs.
(A) The villagers found his response puzzling. They just 
stared at Jim and said, “What do you mean you don’t 
sing? You talk!” Jim recalls later, “It was as odd to 
them as if I told them that I couldn’t walk or dance, 
even though I have both my legs.”
(B) Jim replied in a soft voice, “I don’t sing,” and it was 
true. Although he was an excellent oboe player, he was 
unable to sing a simple melody.
(C) That’s because singing and dancing were a natural 
activity in their lives, involving everyone. Their word 
for singing, ho bina, also means ‘to dance’; there is no 
distinction, since it is assumed that singing involves 
bodily movement.

And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to 
this novel mood. An instantaneous and strong impulse 
moved him to battle with his desperate fate. He would 
pull himself out of despair; he would make a man of 
himself again; he would conquer the evil that had taken 
possession of him. There was time; he was comparatively 
young yet: he would revive his old eager ambitions and 
pursue them without faltering. Those solemn but sweet 
organ notes had set up a revolution in him. Tomorrow he 
would go into the roaring downtown district and find 
work. A fur importer had once offered him a place as 
driver. He would find him tomorrow and ask for the 
position. He would be somebody in the world.

If someone were to say “Life is a cup of coffee,” it is 
unlikely that you would have heard this expression 
before. But its novelty forces you to think about its 
meaning. The vehicle used, a cup of coffee, is a common 
object of everyday life and therefore easily perceivable as 
a source for thinking about that life. The metaphor 
compels you to start thinking of life in terms of the 
kinds of physical, social, and other attributes that are 
associated with a cup of coffee. For this metaphor to 
gain currency, however, it must capture the fancy of 
many other people for a period of time. Then and only 
then will its novelty have become worn out and will it 
become the basis for a new conceptual metaphor: life is 
a drinking substance. After that, expressions such as 
“life is a cup of tea, life is a bottle of beer, life is a glass 
of milk,” will become similarly understandable as 
offering different perspectives on life.

(A)
Sometimes, someone saying you can’t do something is 
good for you. It builds mental toughness and conviction. 
I often tell people, “Anyone with young children will 
tell you, if you ask them not to do something, they’re 
guaranteed to do it.” The following story is an example 
of how my dad used this to (a) his (and ultimately my) 
advantage.
(B)
I was so annoyed and upset by (b) his response that I 
worked tirelessly for the remainder of the school year. In 
those critical few months I worked so hard that I ended 
up winning three awards at the end of year prize-giving. 
The best part was being able to tell my dad that I’d 
been awarded a place at college. On hearing this news, 
he simply lowered his newspaper and, with a smile, said, 
“Well done, I always knew you would.” At that moment, 
I realized what (c) he had done by ‘discouraging’ me.
(C)
This was my first experience of ‘reverse psychology.’ 
Some people might say it’s a risky strategy, but it has 
certainly worked for me. It has been extremely valuable in 
my life, giving me the confidence, determination and 
motivation to succeed, even when the odds are stacked 
against me. Now as a father myself, I sometimes use the 
same technique to motivate my own son. Often enough, 
he ends up with favorable results. I just hope one day 
(d) he also realizes that I had his best interests in mind.
(D)
As a child I wasn’t particularly academic or ambitious, 
and certainly didn’t work very hard at my studies. It 
wasn’t until I was coming to the end of the eleventh 
grade―and facing the prospect of leaving school without 
any sense of what I wanted to do as a career―that I 
decided to apply to the local college to pursue further 
study. Feeling pleased with myself for having made this 
monumental decision, I proudly announced my plan to 
my dad. (e) His immediate reaction was to say, “You’ll 
never do that. They’ll never accept you.”

Serafina Vinon, a seventy-six-year-old woman from the 
Italian Alps, still gets up at five in the morning to milk her 
cows. Afterward she cooks a huge breakfast, cleans the 
house, and depending on the weather and time of year, 
either takes the herd to the meadow, tends the orchard, or 
cards some wool. In summer she spends weeks on the high 
pastures cutting hay and then carries huge piles of it on her 
head the several miles down to the barn. She could reach 
the barn in half the time if she took a direct route, but she 
prefers following invisible winding trails to save the slopes 
from erosion.
When Serafina was asked what she enjoys doing most in 
life, she had no trouble answering: milking the cows, taking 
them to the pasture, tending the orchard, carding wool. In 
effect what she enjoys most is what she has been doing for 
a living all along. In her own words, “It gives me a great 
satisfaction to be outdoors, to talk with people, and to be 
with my animals. I talk to everybody―plants, birds, flowers, 
and animals. Everything in nature keeps you company; you 
see nature progress every day.”
When she was asked what she would do if she had all 
the time and money in the world, Serafina laughed―and 
repeated the same list of activities. It is not that Serafina is 
ignorant of the alternatives offered by urban life. She 
watches television occasionally and reads newsmagazines. 
But their more fashionable and modern way of life does 
not attract Serafina; she is ________________ the role she 
plays in the universe.
