The famous expression, “Keep your friends close, but keep 
your enemies even closer,” was exemplified well in Nelson 
Mandela’s attempt to learn Afrikaans, the language of his 
enemy. ① Mandela first began to learn the language of the 
Afrikaners, the white South Africans, in the 1960’s to the 
disapproval of his followers. ② They thought it was a waste 
of time, but Mandela felt that it was crucial for gaining insight 
into the world view of the Afrikaners. ③ By obtaining this 
perspective of how the Afrikaners looked at the world, he 
would be able to understand their strengths and weaknesses. 
④ In many ways, Mandela’s greatest contribution as president 
of the South Africans including the Afrikaners was the way 
he chose to leave the presidency. ⑤ This understanding of the 
Afrikaners proved to be invaluable later in successfully 
persuading them to accept his people’s demands.
