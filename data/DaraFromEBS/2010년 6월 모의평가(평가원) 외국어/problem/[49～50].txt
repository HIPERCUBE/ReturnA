Serafina Vinon, a seventy-six-year-old woman from the 
Italian Alps, still gets up at five in the morning to milk her 
cows. Afterward she cooks a huge breakfast, cleans the 
house, and depending on the weather and time of year, 
either takes the herd to the meadow, tends the orchard, or 
cards some wool. In summer she spends weeks on the high 
pastures cutting hay and then carries huge piles of it on her 
head the several miles down to the barn. She could reach 
the barn in half the time if she took a direct route, but she 
prefers following invisible winding trails to save the slopes 
from erosion.
When Serafina was asked what she enjoys doing most in 
life, she had no trouble answering: milking the cows, taking 
them to the pasture, tending the orchard, carding wool. In 
effect what she enjoys most is what she has been doing for 
a living all along. In her own words, “It gives me a great 
satisfaction to be outdoors, to talk with people, and to be 
with my animals. I talk to everybody―plants, birds, flowers, 
and animals. Everything in nature keeps you company; you 
see nature progress every day.”
When she was asked what she would do if she had all 
the time and money in the world, Serafina laughed―and 
repeated the same list of activities. It is not that Serafina is 
ignorant of the alternatives offered by urban life. She 
watches television occasionally and reads newsmagazines. 
But their more fashionable and modern way of life does 
not attract Serafina; she is ________________ the role she 
plays in the universe.
