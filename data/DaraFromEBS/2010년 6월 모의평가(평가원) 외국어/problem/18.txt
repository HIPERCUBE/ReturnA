I have seen people who are very good at their jobs but are 
poor at presenting themselves and, hence, do not convince 
the audience of their capabilities. Presentation is so crucially 
important and will make the difference between getting a 
sale or not. Some people are naturally good presenters, but 
brushing up on your skills in this area will prove profitable. 
There are lots of courses available that are good. Try Think 
Business where courses are cheap or even free. The ABC 
Marketing Institute also offers very good presentation skills 
courses. A good course will help you structure your 
presentations and improve your own personal style. I would 
recommend one that films you while you are presenting and 
then gives a critique of your style.
