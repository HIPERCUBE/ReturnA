19. 밑줄 친 he[him]가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은? 
John was as famous for his tennis skills as he was for his 
fits of temper on the court. One afternoon, I was playing an 
important singles match against John. When things didn’t go 
his way, ① he began to go downhill, complaining about the 
game, screaming at himself, and slamming his racket. It 
looked like ② he was having a public nervous breakdown. 
In the end, the guy who didn’t “deserve to be on the same 
court” with ③ him won in three tough sets. After the match, 
John announced his retirement from tennis at the age of 
twenty seven. He explained, “When I start losing to players 
like ④ him, I’ve got to reconsider what I’m doing even 
playing this game.” If he thought I’d be insulted, ⑤ he was 
wrong. In fact, I loved it.
