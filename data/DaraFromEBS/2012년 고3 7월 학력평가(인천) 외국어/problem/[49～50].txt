If you’ve ever had would-be buyers looking around a
house, you’ll have noticed their observations about each room
are usually limited to: “Hmm, it’s a good size.” or “Hmm, it’s
rather small.” Little wonder then that home-improvers are so
often fixated on making their rooms appear as spacious as
possible. Home design practice will tell them to paint their
ceilings as as possible, and in particular make the
ceiling distinct from the walls. This contrast between ceilings
and walls, so the advice goes, will increase the perceived
room height. Does it really? A recent study shows a
different view for this tradition. Researchers had 32
participants wear 3-D glasses and use a sliding scale to
judge the ceiling height of many virtual rooms. The rooms
were empty and the colors were in shades of grey so that
only lightness was varied. In particular, the ceiling, walls and
floor were varied in lightness. Increasing the lightness of the
ceiling did increase its perceived height. However, contrary
to the traditional advice, the rooms also appeared higher
when the walls were lighter. Moreover, the effect of ceiling
lightness and wall lightness was additive. So the contrast
effect informed by traditional design practice was not
complete. Floor lightness made no difference to estimates of
ceiling height, so it can’t be overall room lightness that’s
crucial, but only the combination of wall and ceiling
lightness. “If you intend to make the room appear higher,
paint both the ceiling and the walls in a color.”
