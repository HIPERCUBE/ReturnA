35. All of us know that advertising does more than merely sell
products and form consumption patterns: it informs, educates,
changes attitudes, and builds images. However, we overlook
that its enormous power is abused more often in developing
countries by transnational corporations. Advertising in
developing countries may facilitate the transfer of
consumption patterns of developed countries to developing
ones, by introducing needs which may not be appropriate,
given the income and demand structure in these countries.
Other unfavorable implications can arise for the developing
countries as a result of misleading advertising which does not
reveal the harmful effects of some products of transnational
firms which, although banned in the developed market
economies, are available in the developing countries because
of insufficient regulation. Furthermore, aggressive advertising
campaigns by transnational corporations in developing countries
may overshadow domestic enterprises.
