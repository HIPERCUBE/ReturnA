In a series of studies, researchers had participants fill in a
questionnaire on their preferences among candy bar brands.
Some participants answered an “intention question” (How likely
are you to purchase a candy bar in the near future?), while
others answered an “attitude question” (How positive or
negative are you about the candy bars available to you?). After
they answered the questions, they were asked to make an
actual brand choice decision in a store. “Those who responded
to an intention question were more likely to choose the brand
they previously indicated they preferred the most than those
who responded to an attitude question,” the researchers say.
Consumers are motivated to fulfill their intentions, and this
motivation narrows their focus. “The intention puts the
intention-related brand to the front of consumers’ minds and
pushes other well-liked brands to the back until the consumer
has accomplished the intention,” the head researcher says.
People who state a(n) (A) of purchasing a certain
