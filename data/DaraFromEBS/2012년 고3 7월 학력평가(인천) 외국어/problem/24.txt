A tremendous proportion of the early learning for an infant
is in developing verbal skills―learning to speak, to understand
speech, to read and to write. However, once a certain
competence has been acquired most people stop developing
verbal skills. Studies have shown that there is a strong
correlation between people’s abilities with words and range of
vocabulary and success in their chosen fields. People who can
express themselves clearly are perceived as more intelligent
and of higher status. Why do we stop doing what we spent
most of our early years doing? The trouble is that we take
our verbal abilities for granted. Once we have mastered
reading, writing and speaking we move on to other things. We
have acquired the most important tool in our mental toolbox.
We depend on it for all sorts of tasks but we rarely take time
to sharpen it. It makes better sense to maintain, enhance and
extend the tool.
