Schoolteacher Carol Tateishi writes that in her Asian
upbringing, she was taught ① that silence is a sign of
self-reliance and strength. She interviewed five Asian American
secondary school students from various ethnic backgrounds.
Even though their families spanned 100 years of immigration,
some recurrent themes ②emerged, such as “you’re not
supposed to say too much” and “talk could cause disrespect and
harsh feelings.” The girls who entered U.S. schools as English
language learners ③ feared speaking up because they were
self-conscious about their language skills. Another girl
mentioned that girls “were not supposed to speak unless
④ speaking to.” Restraint in speech was valued by these
students and their families, whereas speaking in class ⑤ is
taken as intellectual engagement and meaning-making in U.S.
classrooms.
