29. Recently, an experiment was conducted on college students
where they were asked to participate in a food taste test.
However, the real object of the test was to demonstrate that
. A group of ten
college students were recruited to perform a taste test on a new
yogurt. However, nine of the ten students were part of the
experiment and were told to repeat a predetermined response when
asked about the taste. Only one test subject was the actual
unknown. When given the yogurt to taste, each was asked to give
their impressions. The test subject was to go last. The yogurt
given was strawberry flavored. After hearing the responses of the
other nine students claiming to taste vanilla instead of strawberry,
the test subject in eight out of ten cases went with the majority
and said he tasted vanilla instead of strawberry. When the
experiment was repeated with many subjects, only about 20
percent of the subjects stuck to their guns.
