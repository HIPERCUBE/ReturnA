Last week, your company came out to paint the stripes on
our new parking lot. I was on vacation at the time but when I
returned, I was appalled at the poor workmanship that was
done. Some of the lines are shorter than others and most are
uneven. Our patrons are not even sure how to park. We’ve
finally had another company lined up to redo the work next
week. The work your company did should be somehow
removed. Please be advised you have until Friday of this week
to be finished. I expect to see a clean blacktop surface ready
for the new crew to begin work on. I myself will be overseeing
this and expect to have the utmost cooperation.

19. 밑줄 친 부분이 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Kalu, an elephant in the Central Park Zoo, trusted only one
handler, a man named Albert Brockell. When Albert became
sick with leukemia, Kalu refused to go inside to his quarters
because ①his “main man” had not spoken the command. As
winter approached, this became a serious concern. No one else
could persuade ② him. He responded to an attempt at forcing
him inside with anger, injuring the new would-be handler.
Desperate zoo officials finally made a recording of Albert at the
hospital, so Kalu could hear his voice ordering ③him to go
inside. But Kalu refused to obey a mere recording. Finally
Albert volunteered to be taken to the zoo in an ambulance.
④He was delivered to the elephant’s side on a gurney. “Go
inside, Kalu,” he said. Finally ⑤he obeyed.
*gurney: 환자수송용 들것

Schoolteacher Carol Tateishi writes that in her Asian
upbringing, she was taught ① that silence is a sign of
self-reliance and strength. She interviewed five Asian American
secondary school students from various ethnic backgrounds.
Even though their families spanned 100 years of immigration,
some recurrent themes ②emerged, such as “you’re not
supposed to say too much” and “talk could cause disrespect and
harsh feelings.” The girls who entered U.S. schools as English
language learners ③ feared speaking up because they were
self-conscious about their language skills. Another girl
mentioned that girls “were not supposed to speak unless
④ speaking to.” Restraint in speech was valued by these
students and their families, whereas speaking in class ⑤ is
taken as intellectual engagement and meaning-making in U.S.
classrooms.

Empathy is made possible by a special group of nerve cells
called mirror neurons. These special cells enable us to “mirror”
emotions. Mirror neurons were first discovered by Italian
scientists who, while looking at the activity of individual nerve
cells inside the brains of monkeys, (A) noticed / noticing that
neurons in the same area of the brain were activated whether
the animals were performing a particular movement or simply
observing another monkey perform the same action. It appeared
as though the cells in the observer’s brain “mirrored” the
activity in the performer’s brain. A similar phenomenon takes
place when we watch someone (B) experiencing / experienced an
emotion and feel the same emotion in response. The same neural
systems get activated in a part of the insula, (C) it / which is part
of the mirror neuron system, and in the emotional brain areas
associated with the observed emotion.
(A) (B) (C)
① noticed …… experiencing …… it
② noticed …… experiencing …… which
③ noticed …… experienced …… which
④ noticing …… experiencing …… it
⑤ noticing …… experienced …… it
22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
We have been talking of social science as if it were a single
entity. That is hardly the case. Which, in fact, are the social
sciences? ①One way to answer the question is to see what
departments and disciplines universities group under this name.
②Social science divisions usually include departments of
anthropology, economics, politics, and sociology. ③Why do
they not ordinarily include schools of law, education, business,
social service, and public administration as well, all of which
draw on the concepts and methods of the social sciences for
their development? ④ It explains why a social science major
provides excellent preparation for law school. ⑤The reason is
that the main purpose of such schools is to train for
professional work outside of the university, while the previously
mentioned departments are more exclusively dedicated to the
pursuit of systematic knowledge of human society, an activity
that usually goes on within the university.
23. 다음 글에 드러난 Rip의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
As Rip was about to descend he heard a voice from a
distance hallooing, “Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!” He
looked around, but could see nothing but a crow winging its
solitary flight across the mountain. He thought his fancy must
have deceived him, and turned again to descend, when he
heard the same cry ring through the still evening air, “Rip Van
Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!”―at the same time his dog bristled
up his back, and giving a low growl, skulked to his master’s
side, looking fearfully down into the glen. Rip now felt a vague
apprehension stealing over him: he looked anxiously in the
same direction, and perceived a strange figure slowly toiling up
the rocks, and bending under the weight of something he
carried on his back.
① sad and lonely ② uneasy and worried
③ happy and relieved ④ disappointed and ashamed
⑤ cold and indifferent
24. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
A tremendous proportion of the early learning for an infant
is in developing verbal skills―learning to speak, to understand
speech, to read and to write. However, once a certain
competence has been acquired most people stop developing
verbal skills. Studies have shown that there is a strong
correlation between people’s abilities with words and range of
vocabulary and success in their chosen fields. People who can
express themselves clearly are perceived as more intelligent
and of higher status. Why do we stop doing what we spent
most of our early years doing? The trouble is that we take
our verbal abilities for granted. Once we have mastered
reading, writing and speaking we move on to other things. We
have acquired the most important tool in our mental toolbox.
We depend on it for all sorts of tasks but we rarely take time
to sharpen it. It makes better sense to maintain, enhance and
extend the tool.

⑤ 읽기능력 발달이 쓰기능력 발달보다 선행되어야 한다.

25. Why did the same themes and motifs appear through the
myths and folktales of the entire world? One response of many
late-nineteenth century writers was to suggest that somehow
all the stories, myths and legends were simply attempts to
explain and to dramatize , familiar to all
mankind. One popular theory was that stories of the god who
dies and is reborn were “solar myths”, describing the setting
and rising of the sun. It was suggested that the widespread
folktales in which a heroine is eaten by a monster must have
had something to do with the sun being “eaten” by the moon
in the course of an eclipse. A more sophisticated version of
these arguments has been advanced in more recent times by
writers who attempted to relate the underlying forms of
tragedy and comedy to the theme of “death and resurrection”
in the cycle of the year, for example, winter giving way to
spring, and so forth.
① cultural identity ② heroic deeds
③ religious rituals ④ ethnic conflicts
⑤ natural phenomena
26. Are you tired of always being told to “look on the bright side”?
Do you wish your optimistic friends would just leave you alone and
let you be negative? If you answered “yes” to either of these
questions, you may be one of the millions of people who have
learned to cope with the pressures of modern life by using what
Dr. Norem calls Defensive Pessimism, a strategy of imagining the
worst-case scenario of any situation to motivate and carry out
effective actions. What if the train is running late, and you won’t
make it to your job interview on time? What if you don’t know
anyone at a party you’ll be attending? What if you don’t know any
of the questions on your final exam? Dr. Norem believes
actually helps people go on to do their best
by preparing for the worst. In fact, she has found that many people
perform more poorly when forced to think positive, since negative
thinking is often an effective strategy for managing anxiety.
① depending on intuitions
② indulging in negative thoughts
③ reducing anxiety and depression
④ making accurate future predictions
⑤ repeating small errors and mistakes
27. Using a cast after injuring an arm may cause your brain to
　　　　　　　 , according to a new study. For the
study, researchers examined 10 right-handed people with an injury
of the upper right arm that required a cast for at least 14 days.
The entire right arm and hand were restricted to little or no
movement during the study period. As a result, participants used
their non-dominant left hand for daily activities such as washing,
using a toothbrush, eating or writing. The group underwent two
MRI brain scans, the first within two days of the injury and the
second within 16 days of wearing the cast. The scans measured
the amount of gray and white matter in the brain. The study
found that the amount of gray and white matter in the left side of
the brain decreased up to ten percent, while the amount of gray
and white matter in the right side of the brain increased in size.
“These swift structural changes in the brain are associated with
skill transfer from the right hand to the left hand,” said the head
researcher.
① shift quickly to adjust ② be dull to external stimuli
③ transmit false information ④ retain memories inefficiently
⑤ slow its information processing
28. Randy Garner, of Sam Houston State University, mailed surveys,
varying the information on the cover sheet to ensure that the first
name of the addressee either matched or didn’t match the
experimenter’s first name. So in the “matching name” group, a
participant named Fred Smith might receive a survey from
researcher Fred Jones, while in the “non-matching name” group,
participant Julie Green might get a survey from Amanda White. This
remarkably simple manipulation affected the response rate, with 30
percent in the non-matching name condition returning the survey,
compared to 56 percent returned from those who saw their own first
name on the cover. This work suggests that people are far more
likely to support, and agree with, those who appear to be like them.
The research points to a simple fact: .
① Similarity works ② Ignorance is bliss
③ Men learn by doubting ④ Nothing hurts like the truth
⑤ There is strength in individuality
29. Recently, an experiment was conducted on college students
where they were asked to participate in a food taste test.
However, the real object of the test was to demonstrate that
. A group of ten
college students were recruited to perform a taste test on a new
yogurt. However, nine of the ten students were part of the
experiment and were told to repeat a predetermined response when
asked about the taste. Only one test subject was the actual
unknown. When given the yogurt to taste, each was asked to give
their impressions. The test subject was to go last. The yogurt
given was strawberry flavored. After hearing the responses of the
other nine students claiming to taste vanilla instead of strawberry,
the test subject in eight out of ten cases went with the majority
and said he tasted vanilla instead of strawberry. When the
experiment was repeated with many subjects, only about 20
percent of the subjects stuck to their guns.
① overconfidence results in bad choices
② unpleasant flavors change eating habits
③ independent thinking is essential for creativity
④ group pressure leads to unreasonable conformity
⑤ reward plays an important role in decision making
30. Several species of oceanic bacteria consume methane gas that
naturally seeps from the ocean floor. So after the BP blowout
in spring and summer of 2010, when 172 million gallons of
methane-rich oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, scientists
wondered how much of the dissolved gas might be consumed
by native microbes. To find out, oceanographers collected more
than 700 water samples around the spill. They found bacteria
had eliminated more than 120,000 tons of methane, essentially
returning the concentrations in the area to normal. But there is
still work to be done. The bacterial cleanup probably did not
eliminate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, known as one of the
most toxic and potentially dangerous ingredients in oil. “The
bacteria did a nice job taking care of some of the major oil
components,” the researcher says, “but that doesn’t mean we
can .” [3점]
① eliminate all bacteria from the ocean
② use technology to dissolve toxic chemicals
③ prevent bacteria from contaminating the ocean
④ restore the natural habitat of endangered species
⑤ count on nature to handle all man-made disasters

When you learn a new skill, at first you need to concentrate
in order to make your fingers, hands, and arms move in just
the right way, based on what you see. What you’re learning
is precision. After a while, (A) , the
“seeing-thinking-doing” gradually becomes “seeing-doing”
because your muscles seem to “know” and “remember” just what
to do. What you are learning now is speed. That’s “muscle
memory”. Of course, during the “drill-and-practice”, your muscles
are not really memorizing anything. (B) , what you
see with your eyes is interpreted by your brain in the form of
nerve signals to your muscles to make your body move. Now
by making the same movements in response to the same visual
cues over and over again, the associated nerve-muscle
connections gradually become more effective, and this is how
the “thinking” in the “seeing-thinking-doing” is gradually
replaced by “seeing-doing”.
(A) (B)
① for example …… Thus
② for example …… Furthermore
③ however …… Instead
④ however …… Similarly
⑤ therefore …… In contrast

Most visitors to zoos are convinced that the inmates live in
①comfort, but this view is far from the truth in many cases.
Many caged animals are in fact facing a survival problem as
severe as that of their cousins in the ②wild. Well fed, well
housed, well cared for, and protected from its natural enemies, the
zoo animal in its super-Welfare State existence is bored, sometimes
literally to death. According to some zoologists, the animal species
which seem to react most strongly to this ③monotony are the
ones that do not rely on one or two highly developed adaptations
or “tricks” to survive in the wild. Normally seizing every
opportunity to exploit the chances and variety of their
surroundings, they are constantly ④exploring. It is not surprising
that when such species are placed in the highly ⑤variable
environment of a zoo cage, where there are few novel stimuli, they
cannot accept any kind of enforced inactivity.

Financial markets have become more variable since exch[a3n점ge]

34. In order to efficiently use and measure time, everyone in
the world would like to fix noon as the time at which the
sun is at its highest point in the sky. However, this seems to
be impossible without the use of time zones. Since the Earth
rotates at the rate of 15 degrees every hour, the sun is at its
highest point in the sky at different times in the day for
different countries around the globe. The idea behind time
zones is that we can divide the world into 24 equal slices or
zones, 15 degrees each, and adjust the clocks accordingly for
each zone. We can thus preserve the need to fix noon as the
time when the sun is highest in the sky for each country,
and also make it easy to understand times between different
zones.
① the reason why we have time zones
② the origin of dividing a day into 24 hours
③ international policies for daylight saving time
④ the advantage of using the clockwise direction
⑤ the inconvenience of traveling through different time zones
35. All of us know that advertising does more than merely sell
products and form consumption patterns: it informs, educates,
changes attitudes, and builds images. However, we overlook
that its enormous power is abused more often in developing
countries by transnational corporations. Advertising in
developing countries may facilitate the transfer of
consumption patterns of developed countries to developing
ones, by introducing needs which may not be appropriate,
given the income and demand structure in these countries.
Other unfavorable implications can arise for the developing
countries as a result of misleading advertising which does not
reveal the harmful effects of some products of transnational
firms which, although banned in the developed market
economies, are available in the developing countries because
of insufficient regulation. Furthermore, aggressive advertising
campaigns by transnational corporations in developing countries
may overshadow domestic enterprises.
① need for regulation of false international ads
② rapid economic growth of developing countries
③ changes of consumption patterns in developing countries
④ current challenges to developed countries’ economic recovery
⑤ bad effects of transnational firms’ advertising on developing countries

The above graph shows the top five favorite literature genres in
England by gender in 2008. ①According to the graph, history is
the most popular literature genre among men in England.
②Among women, fiction is more popular than any other literature
genre, accounting for more than 40 percent, while one out of four
men think that fiction is their favorite. ③The percentage of men
who choose biography as their favorite is more than twice that of
women who choose the same. ④Of the five genres, poetry is the
third most popular one for women, with a rate of around 15 percent,
but it is the least popular genre for men. ⑤Both genders show the
same popularity percentage for criticism with 10 percent each.
37. Neuschwanstein Castle에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
One of the world’s most iconic and renowned castles is
Neuschwanstein Castle, which is situated in the Emerald
mountains of Bavaria, Germany, close to the border of Tirol in
Austria. Built from 1869 to 1892, it was constructed as a private
retreat from public life for Ludwig II of Bavaria. Ironically, seven
weeks after the death of King Ludwig II, this castle was opened
to the public. Known for its wondrous Romanesque Revival
architecture and richly decorated interior, Neuschwanstein Castle
today is visited by more than one million people every year. In
fact, it served as the inspiration for Sleeping Beauty Castle in
Disney Land.
① 오스트리아의 Tirol에 위치하고 있다.
② 20여 년의 공사 후에 1869년에 완공되었다.
③ Ludwig 2세가 즉위하면서 대중들에게 개방되기 시작하였다.
④ 로마네스크 양식이 사용되었으며 실내장식은 화려하지 않다.

38. Mary Jane Grant에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Mary Jane Grant was born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1805. Her
father was a Scottish soldier, and her mother a Jamaican. Mary
learned her nursing skills from her mother, who kept a boarding
house for invalid soldiers. Being of mixed race, Mary and her
family had few civil rights―they could not vote, hold public
office or enter the professions. In 1836, Mary married Edwin
Seacole but the marriage was short-lived as he died in 1844. In
1854, Mary travelled to England, and approached the War Office,
asking to be sent as an army nurse to the Crimea, but she was
refused. Undaunted, Mary funded her own trip to the Crimea
where she established the British Hotel near Balaclava to
provide comfortable quarters for sick and injured soldiers.
① 어머니에게서 간호 기술을 배웠다.
② 혼혈인이라는 이유로 공직자가 될 수 없었다.
③ 결혼한 지 10년도 안 되어 남편이 사망했다.
④ 1854년에 군대 간호사로서 Crimea에 파병되었다.
⑤ 부상당한 군인들을 위해 Crimea에 British Hotel을 세웠다.

39. How many times do you finish something even though you
wish you’d never started it? We clean our plates even if the
carrots are overcooked because they are there and we’ve
already started eating. We do this even though we would
never seek overcooked carrots and wouldn’t want them if
anyone offered them to us. We sit in the movie theater and
keep watching the movie when we think it’s terrible, even
though under no circumstances would we say yes if someone
asked, “Would you like to watch forty-five minutes of an
awful movie?” We do the same thing when we continue a
project that is off target. We keep going because we’ve
already started, not because it makes any sense to continue
what we’re doing. Don’t run in the wrong direction just
because you’re near the finish line. What is important is not
what you’ve already invested but what you stand to gain by
continuing.
① 목표를 설정할 때 철저한 사전조사를 해야 한다.
② 집단 구성원의 다양한 의견에 귀를 기울여야 한다.

④ 이미 시작한 일이라도 계속할 가치가 없다면 멈춰야 한다.
⑤ 목표를 달성하려면 단기적인 성취에 만족하지 말아야 한다.
40. Sometimes we need an adversary to defeat in order to turn
our “I” and “me” into “we” and “us”. We may think of
ourselves as independent individualists, yet we can be
transformed into enthusiastic citizens, fans, members, or
followers by a team championship or victory. Researchers call
it Basking in Reflected Glory. After a team victory, far more
students show up to classes wearing clothes with their
university’s name and symbols plastered on them. When they
talk about the team’s win, they are more likely to use the
pronouns “we” and “us” instead of “they” and “them”. They
stress their connection to the winners. The social
psychological perspective on community and fan loyalty
stresses the positive impact of this shared identity―as a
supporter and fan of the team―on relationships and overall
well-being. It helps people escape the feeling of isolation and
individuality that sometimes plagues them.

41. With today’s global competition, there is increasing concern about
the nature and quality of higher education. One of the main
concerns focuses on higher education’s purpose―should it be
practical and graduate well-equipped students to supply a
competitive workforce? Or, should it rather explore what some
critics label “romantic” notions of a liberal education with broad
ideas and values to prepare students for democratic citizenship?
Many people in the modern world think it is he who specializes
who survives and thrives. However, it is not absolutely the case.
For students to be truly successful in today’s challenging global
economy, higher education must recognize and emphasize that
practical and liberal education are tightly coupled, and that students’
academic, developmental, interpersonal and experiential lives are

well-rounded education which can cultivate the “whole student”
instead of overestimating technical and vocational education.

42. Usually, an article for publication in a scholarly journal is
produced for a specific audience. It will have to be carefully and
accurately written because the editors of the publication and its
readers will not accept poorly researched writing. When an author
finishes writing an article, he or she submits it to the editors of
the publication. It is then usually sent to many professional
readers who will comment on how the information was gathered
and decide whether the article is worthy of publication. Feedback
from them often results in significant revisions or changes to the
document. The author might even decide not to proceed with
further writing if, for example, the document has major flaws or if
the research on which it is based is found to be incomplete or
faulty. This step is rigorous and it usually ensures that only
high-quality articles are published.

The bread was made of grains ground on rough stones, which
caused small stones to become incorporated into the bread dough.
One of the greatest civilizations of ancient times was the
Egyptians. The ancient Egyptians excelled in many areas of
science, one of these being dentistry. (① ) However, they
suffered from rather unique types of dental problems due to
their culture. (② ) The basic diet of Egyptians consisted mainly
of plants and breads. (③ ) This produced a bread which was
very coarse in consistency and difficult to chew. (④ ) The
plants in their diet were also quite gritty as the area in which
they lived was very sandy. (⑤ ) The combination of these two
conditions caused extensive wear and abrasion of their teeth,
leading to problems such as nerve exposure.

Much of socialization takes place during human interaction,
without the deliberate intent to impart knowledge or values.
(A) It is very likely that the message Sally received from the
morning’s interactions was that it is not OK for children
to interrupt adults, but it is OK for adults to interrupt
children. The example shows that unintentional socialization
may be the product of involvement in human interaction or
observation of interaction.
(B) Later that morning Sally and her friend Tanya are busily
playing with Legos. Sally is explaining and demonstrating
to Tanya how to fit the pieces together. Miss Jones
comes over to the block corner and interrupts with,
“Girls, please stop what you’re doing and come and see
what Rene has brought to school.”
(C) For example, a four-year-old approaches two teachers
conversing and excitedly says, “Miss Jones, Miss Jones,
look!” One teacher says, “Sally, don’t interrupt; we’re
talking.”

In a series of studies, researchers had participants fill in a
questionnaire on their preferences among candy bar brands.
Some participants answered an “intention question” (How likely
are you to purchase a candy bar in the near future?), while
others answered an “attitude question” (How positive or
negative are you about the candy bars available to you?). After
they answered the questions, they were asked to make an
actual brand choice decision in a store. “Those who responded
to an intention question were more likely to choose the brand
they previously indicated they preferred the most than those
who responded to an attitude question,” the researchers say.
Consumers are motivated to fulfill their intentions, and this
motivation narrows their focus. “The intention puts the
intention-related brand to the front of consumers’ minds and
pushes other well-liked brands to the back until the consumer
has accomplished the intention,” the head researcher says.
People who state a(n) (A) of purchasing a certain
brand are more likely to buy it than those who express
their attitude toward the brand because they are motivated
to (B) what they intend.
(A) (B)
① intention …… complete
② habit …… attain
③ intention …… hide
④ decision …… revise
⑤ habit …… conceal

(A)
In high school, sports were Kazazic’s passion. She planned
to become a professional athlete. Then in 1993, during the
Bosnian civil war, a bomb by Croat separatists exploded in the
courtyard of her building. The six friends she’d been chatting
with were killed; 16-year-old Kazazic was badly injured. The
bomb riddled (a) her left arm and both of her legs.
(B)
Her parents finally joined her in Maryland, but Kazazic was
already fiercely independent. After studying psychology at a
university, (b) she got a job at an insurance firm and
eventually founded her own website development company.
After dozens of surgeries, she was able to play the occasional
round of golf. But she still hobbled on an imperfect leg, and
each activity left her in agony for days. To unwind, (c) she
would watch dolphins play at Clearwater Marine Aquarium,
near her home.
(C)
A young dolphin, Winter, who had lost her tail in a crab
trap, caught Kazazic’s eye: “She swam more like a shrimp
than a dolphin. I identified with her.” Trainers were fitting
Winter with a high-tech tail―a flexible steel joint covered in
silicone plastic. When they were done, Winter streaked off
through the water. Kazazic was fascinated. ‘If (d) she can do
this, there’s no way I can’t,’ she thought. Within ten days, she
had a new leg with its soft liner and built-in microprocessor
that adjusts the fit for different activities. It was the disabled
dolphin that gave inspiration and helped her to feel pain-free
for the first time in almost 16 years.
(D)
At a makeshift hospital, her left leg was considered beyond
repair and amputated just below the knee. British activist
Sally Becker, who evacuated many children during the war,
arranged to bring (e) her to the United States for treatment.
Kazazic spent nearly two years in a hospital in Maryland. A
few months in, Kazazic received her first artificial leg, but
walking was intensely painful. Nonetheless, she managed to
graduate from a high school in Maryland. At 18, she left the
hospital and moved into an apartment with a fellow refugee.

If you’ve ever had would-be buyers looking around a
house, you’ll have noticed their observations about each room
are usually limited to: “Hmm, it’s a good size.” or “Hmm, it’s
rather small.” Little wonder then that home-improvers are so
often fixated on making their rooms appear as spacious as
possible. Home design practice will tell them to paint their
ceilings as as possible, and in particular make the
ceiling distinct from the walls. This contrast between ceilings
and walls, so the advice goes, will increase the perceived
room height. Does it really? A recent study shows a
different view for this tradition. Researchers had 32
participants wear 3-D glasses and use a sliding scale to
judge the ceiling height of many virtual rooms. The rooms
were empty and the colors were in shades of grey so that
only lightness was varied. In particular, the ceiling, walls and
floor were varied in lightness. Increasing the lightness of the
ceiling did increase its perceived height. However, contrary
to the traditional advice, the rooms also appeared higher
when the walls were lighter. Moreover, the effect of ceiling
lightness and wall lightness was additive. So the contrast
effect informed by traditional design practice was not
complete. Floor lightness made no difference to estimates of
ceiling height, so it can’t be overall room lightness that’s
crucial, but only the combination of wall and ceiling
lightness. “If you intend to make the room appear higher,
paint both the ceiling and the walls in a color.”
