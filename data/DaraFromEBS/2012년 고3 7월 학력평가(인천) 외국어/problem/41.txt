41. With today’s global competition, there is increasing concern about
the nature and quality of higher education. One of the main
concerns focuses on higher education’s purpose―should it be
practical and graduate well-equipped students to supply a
competitive workforce? Or, should it rather explore what some
critics label “romantic” notions of a liberal education with broad
ideas and values to prepare students for democratic citizenship?
Many people in the modern world think it is he who specializes
who survives and thrives. However, it is not absolutely the case.
For students to be truly successful in today’s challenging global
economy, higher education must recognize and emphasize that
practical and liberal education are tightly coupled, and that students’
academic, developmental, interpersonal and experiential lives are
entwined. In other words, it is advisable that colleges provide a
well-rounded education which can cultivate the “whole student”
instead of overestimating technical and vocational education.
