(A)
In high school, sports were Kazazic’s passion. She planned
to become a professional athlete. Then in 1993, during the
Bosnian civil war, a bomb by Croat separatists exploded in the
courtyard of her building. The six friends she’d been chatting
with were killed; 16-year-old Kazazic was badly injured. The
bomb riddled (a) her left arm and both of her legs.
(B)
Her parents finally joined her in Maryland, but Kazazic was
already fiercely independent. After studying psychology at a
university, (b) she got a job at an insurance firm and
eventually founded her own website development company.
After dozens of surgeries, she was able to play the occasional
round of golf. But she still hobbled on an imperfect leg, and
each activity left her in agony for days. To unwind, (c) she
would watch dolphins play at Clearwater Marine Aquarium,
near her home.
(C)
A young dolphin, Winter, who had lost her tail in a crab
trap, caught Kazazic’s eye: “She swam more like a shrimp
than a dolphin. I identified with her.” Trainers were fitting
Winter with a high-tech tail―a flexible steel joint covered in
silicone plastic. When they were done, Winter streaked off
through the water. Kazazic was fascinated. ‘If (d) she can do
this, there’s no way I can’t,’ she thought. Within ten days, she
had a new leg with its soft liner and built-in microprocessor
that adjusts the fit for different activities. It was the disabled
dolphin that gave inspiration and helped her to feel pain-free
for the first time in almost 16 years.
(D)
At a makeshift hospital, her left leg was considered beyond
repair and amputated just below the knee. British activist
Sally Becker, who evacuated many children during the war,
arranged to bring (e) her to the United States for treatment.
Kazazic spent nearly two years in a hospital in Maryland. A
few months in, Kazazic received her first artificial leg, but
walking was intensely painful. Nonetheless, she managed to
graduate from a high school in Maryland. At 18, she left the
hospital and moved into an apartment with a fellow refugee.
