28. Randy Garner, of Sam Houston State University, mailed surveys,
varying the information on the cover sheet to ensure that the first
name of the addressee either matched or didn’t match the
experimenter’s first name. So in the “matching name” group, a
participant named Fred Smith might receive a survey from
researcher Fred Jones, while in the “non-matching name” group,
participant Julie Green might get a survey from Amanda White. This
remarkably simple manipulation affected the response rate, with 30
percent in the non-matching name condition returning the survey,
compared to 56 percent returned from those who saw their own first
name on the cover. This work suggests that people are far more
likely to support, and agree with, those who appear to be like them.
The research points to a simple fact: .
① Similarity works ② Ignorance is bliss
③ Men learn by doubting ④ Nothing hurts like the truth
⑤ There is strength in individuality
