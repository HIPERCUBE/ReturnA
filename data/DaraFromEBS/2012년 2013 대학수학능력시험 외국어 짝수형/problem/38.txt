38. Scientists should be careful to reduce bias in their 
experiments. A bias occurs when what the scientist expects 
changes how the results are viewed. This expectation might 
cause a scientist to select a result from one trial over those 
from other trials. Scientists can lessen bias by running as 
many trials as possible and by keeping accurate notes of 
each observation made. Valid experiments  also must have 
data that are measurable. This allows others to compare 
the results to data they obtain from a similar experiment. 
Most importantly, the experiment must be repeatable. 
Findings are supportable when other scientists perform the 
same experiment and get the same results.
