26. By likening the eye to a camera, elementary biology 
textbooks help to produce a misleading impression of 
what perception entails. Only in terms of the physics of 
image formation do the eye and camera have anything in 
common. Both eye and camera have a lens that focuses 
light rays from the outside world into an image, and both 
have a means of adjusting the focus and brightness of 
that image. Both eye and camera have a light-sensitive 
layer onto which the image is cast (the retina and film, 
respectively). However, image formation is only the first 
step towards seeing.  
obscure the much more fundamental difference between 
the two, which is that the camera merely records an 
image, whereas the visual system interprets it. [3점]
