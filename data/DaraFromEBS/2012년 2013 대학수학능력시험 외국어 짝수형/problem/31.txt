all kinds. It is in one sense a useful response gone awry ― 
an overly zealous mental preparation for an anticipated threat. 
But such mental rehearsal is (A) disastrous / constructive  
cognitive static when it becomes trapped in a stale routine 
that captures attention, intruding on all other attempts to focus 
elsewhere. Anxiety undermines the intellect. In a complex,

of air traffic controllers, for example, having chronically 
high anxiety is an almost sure predictor that a person 
will eventually fail in training or in the field. The anxious 
are more likely to fail even given (B) inferior / superior
scores on intelligence tests, as a study of 1,790 students in 
training for air traffic control posts discovered. Anxiety 
also sabotages academic performance of all kinds: 126 
different studies of more than 36,000 people found that the 
more (C) prone / resistant to anxieties a person is, the 
poorer his or her academic performance is.
