I’m sure you’ll enjoy reading the book, too. 
Okay. I’m going to make a list of my own. 
I agree. It’s really difficult to reach the goal. 
Don’t give up, and you can fulfill your dreams.
Well, keeping a diary helps you to find a solution.

When people expect to see someone again, they are 
more likely to find that person attractive, regardless of the 
individual’s behavior, than if they do not have expectations 
of future interaction. The expectation of future interaction 
motivates people to look for positive qualities in someone 
so that they will look forward to future interactions rather 
than dread them, and increases the chances that people 
will find the individual attractive. Conversely, when people 
interact with someone whom they do not foresee meeting 
again, they have little reason to search for positive 
qualities. In fact, doing so may be depressing, given that 
they may not have the opportunity to get to know the 
person better in future interactions. Indeed, people are 
sometimes motivated to find negative qualities in 
individuals whom they do not expect to see again.
Even when scientists are able to identify seemingly 
beneficial nutrients, they cannot always understand how 
those nutrients will operate in a real-life context, in the 
course of our daily meals. Fruits and vegetables are believed 
to help prevent cancer. Scientists have believed that it is the 
antioxidants in these foods that make the difference
compounds like beta carotene, lycopene, and vitamin E. Yet 
when these molecules were extracted from fruits and 
vegetables and made into supplements, they did not reduce 
cancer. The beta carotene supplement actually increased the 
risk of certain cancers. In other words, scientists thoroughly 
misunderstood the causes of complex events. They identified 
one element engaged in the process of nutrition without 
fully comprehending how the system as a whole truly 
functions. Nutritional scientists pursuing the hot paradigm 
of isolating nutrients failed to see a multitude of links in 
the complex chain that leads to good health.

Artists create artistic works to get viewers to have 
certain kinds of experiences. But the intention to convey 
certain experiences to viewers is sometimes secondary to 
the intention to express the artistic imagination creatively. 
Consider actions generally for the moment. Think, for 
example, of people watching their favorite sporting team. 
Whether it is at an actual match or in a bar, at crucial 
periods in a game people tend to make gestures in 
anticipation or cheer in exhortation. They often want to 
convey their sense of urgency to the team, or people at 
the bar may want to show their disgust to others in the 
crowd. But they often express themselves in this manner 
without any thought for what others think or how they 
may respond. Actions we perform through which we 
intend to express our feelings, thoughts, and attitudes 
need not have any communicative intent for how others 
may respond. At least some works should be understood 
as the representation of just this kind of action.

I was reminded of our mission earlier this year when 
my mother sold her house. Because of my father’s failing 
health, my parents recently moved from Florida to 
Maryland to live with my elder sister and her family. 
At my mom’s request, my brothers, sisters, and I sorted 
through all her belongings. She told us to keep or 
discard whatever we pleased. For myself I kept a solitary 
piece of china, one of the few remaining plates from the 
set my grandfather bought my mother for her wedding. 
I can still remember the set in better days serving 
many a guest on a Sunday afternoon. But its comrades 
have all been broken or have disappeared, and this plate 
is all I have. It is delicate and faded you can no 
longer read the pattern name printed on the back. But it 
hangs in my dining room as a pleasant reminder of her 
hospitality.

Occasionally, there are children who have trouble 
understanding that their clothing choice is inappropriate or 
even unhealthy. Some children follow the suggestion 
that sandals may not be the best option for a snowy day. 
For those kids, experience may be the best teacher. 
For example, when Lydia was eight years old, she 
insisted on wearing her favorite sandals to school despite 
warnings that the sidewalks were covered in snow and 
slush. Her mom worried that she would arrive at 
school with cold, wet feet, but Lydia would not change 
her mind. Of course, her mother was right. While Lydia 
did have some very uncomfortable toes because they 
became soaked and frozen on her way to and from 
school, she learned that sometimes fashion isn’t worth 
the price of serious discomfort.

The above graph shows the percentage of women in wage 
employment in the non-agricultural sector in 1990 and 2006.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, women’s waged 
non-agricultural employment increased more than five 
percentage points between 1990 and 2006. In 2006, the 
percentage of women’s waged non-agricultural employment 
in East Asia and Pacific countries was twice as high as that 
of South Asia. In that same year, the percentage of 
women’s waged non-agricultural employment in the Middle 
East and North Africa was less than that of Sub-Saharan 
Africa by ten percentage points. Despite the improvement 
between 1990 and 2006, South Asia showed the smallest 
increase in the percentage of women in waged non-agricultural 
employment. Between 1990 and 2006, the increase in the 
percentage of women’s waged non-agricultural employment 
in Sub-Saharan Africa was larger than that of the Middle 
East and North Africa.
Zelia Maria Magdalena Nuttall
American archaeologist-ethnohistorian Zelia Maria Magdalena 
Nuttall was well known especially for her investigations of 
pre-Columbian culture and her studies of Mexican peoples 
and native Mexican plants. Nuttall was a brilliant archival 
researcher and self-trained archaeologist who very early carved 
a career for herself by pursuing independent research and 
publishing in scholarly journals. Before age 30 she became 
a member of several highly prestigious scientific societies 
on the basis of her work. She was the winner of three 
medals for the exhibits of the results of her archival work 
and archaeological research, which she presented in Europe 
and the United States. Nuttall was never a part of university 
teaching faculty, and indeed there is no indication that she 
would have accepted such a position had it been offered. 
Early in her career, she was appointed Honorary Assistant 
in Mexican Archaeology at the Peabody Museum of 
Harvard University, a post she held for forty-seven years.

Wood is a material that is widely acknowledged to be 
environmentally friendly. It has been welcome as an 
alternative material for a long time in building houses 
instead of cement or bricks. However, it is not always 
easy to of one particular 
material such as wood over another. Many species of tree 
are now endangered, including mahogany and teak, and 
deforestation, particularly in tropical rainforests, has had a 
severe impact both on local communities and on native 
plants and wildlife. Where wood is harvested and then 
transported halfway across the globe, the associated energy 
costs are high, causing a negative impact on the 
environment. What is more, where wood is treated with 
chemicals to improve fire- and pest-resistance, its healthful 
properties are compromised.

tedious annoyances and struggles that may be temporary 
roadblocks but feel more like concrete mountains. While 
there’s plenty of research that shows that people who 
work with the muscles above their neck create all kinds

the why of their jobs (as opposed to the what and the 
how) who can manage the day-to-day problems more 
easily. That is, if you can define the purpose of your

People knowingly or unknowingly will take too much, 
even though it is not for anyone’s collective or long-term 
good. As Hardin put it, “Freedom in a commons brings 
ruin to all.” Consider a traffic jam on a main road going 
into any big city. Each person picks that particular road 
for the logical reason that it’s the fastest route. In the 
beginning, each additional car does not slow the traffic 
down, as there is enough room on the road for the 
additional drivers. At some point, however, each car 
reduces the average speed, and eventually there are so 
many drivers that the traffic slows to a crawl. All the 
people seeking to minimize their own driving time add 
up to a longer commute for everyone. Doing what’s

befall environmental issues such as overfished seas and 
rivers, air pollution, and water scarcity.

Researchers asked college student volunteers to think 
through a fantasy version of an experience (looking 
attractive in a pair of high-heeled shoes, winning an essay 
contest, or getting an A on a test) and then evaluated the 
fantasy’s effect on the subjects and on how things 
unfolded in reality. When participants envisioned the most 
positive outcome, their energy levels, as measured by 
blood pressure, dropped, and they reported having a worse 
experience with the actual event than those who had 
conjured more realistic or even negative visions. To assess 
subjects’ real life experiences, the researchers compared 
lists of goals that subjects had set for themselves against 
what they had actually accomplished and also relied on 
self-reports. “When we fantasize about it especially when 
you fantasize something very positive it’s almost like 
you are actually living it,” says one of the study’s 
co-authors. That ,

When confronted by a seemingly simple pointing task, 
where their desires are put in conflict with outcomes, 
chimpanzees find it impossible to exhibit subtle self- 
serving cognitive strategies in the immediate presence of 
a desired reward. However, such tasks are mastered 
. In one 
study, chimps were confronted by a simple choice; two 
plates holding tasty food items were presented, each with 
a different number of treats. If the chimp pointed to the 
plate having more treats, it would immediately be given 
to a fellow chimp in an adjacent cage, and the frustrated 
subject would receive the smaller amount. After hundreds 
and hundreds of trials, these chimps could not learn to 
withhold pointing to the larger reward. However, these 
same chimps had already been taught the symbolic concept 
of simple numbers. When those numbers were placed on the 
plates as a substitute for the actual rewards, the chimps 
promptly learned to point to the smaller numbers first, 
thereby obtaining the larger rewards for themselves.

After making a choice, the decision ultimately changes 
our estimated pleasure, enhancing the expected pleasure 
from the selected option and decreasing the expected 
pleasure from the rejected option. If we were not inclined 
to (A) the value of our options rapidly so that 
they concur with our choices, we would likely second-guess 
ourselves to the point of insanity. We would ask ourselves 
again and again whether we should have chosen Greece 
over Thailand, the toaster over the coffee maker, and Jenny 
over Michele. Consistently second-guessing ourselves would 
interfere with our daily functioning and promote a negative 
effect. We would feel anxious and confused, regretful and 
sad. Have we done the right thing? Should we change our 
mind? These thoughts would result in a permanent halt. 
We would find ourselves literally stuck, overcome by 
(B) and unable to move forward. On the other 
hand, reevaluating our alternatives after making a decision 
increases our commitment to the action taken and keeps us 
moving forward.

Traditionally we have assessed mathematics ability based 
on the number of correct answers on a page full of 
computational problems. Learning and memorizing facts, 
therefore, was the key component to the mathematics 
instructional program. Recently, (A) , many teachers 
have started placing a greater emphasis on mathematical 
understanding, problem solving, hands-on experiences, and 
collaborative work. This change in the instructional 
program can be attributed to well-informed teachers and the 
work of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. 
Now teachers should realize that their students will be 
using mathematics in a world where calculators, computers, 
and other forms of technology are readily available. 
Therefore, the application of mathematics, rather than mere 
fact acquisition, is what will be expected of them in the 
workplace and in life, and (B) mathematics 
instruction should mirror this real life application.

understanding it. 
(B) Consider a chair. Before you can have an idea of a 
chair, you need to understand that there exist in the 
world certain functional objects. Some of these objects 
support human activity, in this case, sitting. 
(C) The combination of the concepts chair and waiting for 
bus allows you to create the new complex concept

of chair is built out of the simpler ideas that we take 
for granted: object, furniture, sitting.

The experimenter then changed the context so that the 
participants had to do a subtly different task.
By changing the focus or context of a task, we can get 
renewed energy even when we feel that we are completely 
out of energy. To demonstrate this, a psychologist asked 
people to take part in what she called ‘semi-free tasks’. The 
tasks included drawing, repeatedly writing ‘ababababababab...’, 
or reading a short poem. ( ) The participants were 
asked to do these tasks until they felt exhausted. ( ) 
Those drawing were asked to redraw their last picture to 
demonstrate how quickly they could draw. ( ) Those 
writing ‘abab’ were asked to sign their name and address. 
( ) In this new context their fatigue disappeared. ( ) 
This phenomenon of creating a second wind can be seen in 
action at airports where security officers rotate around different 
stations to stop routine-induced fatigue from settling in.

During the 1970s, researchers began to suggest that 
human vulnerability to hazards, rather than the hazards 
themselves, was central to understanding the importance 
of hazards, particularly when considering that a city is a 
geographical focus for large populations. Further, it was 
reported that human and material losses from disasters 
had increased during the 20th century. This happened at 
a time when cities in the developing world were 
growing at unprecedented rates, bringing together large 
populations of low income urban residents, often on 
hazardous spontaneous settlements which made them far 
more vulnerable to natural and human-induced hazards. 
It is precisely this issue of vulnerability on which a 
number of social scientists focused, arguing that although 
floods, landslides and earthquakes are natural processes, 
the disasters that can be associated with them are not a 
result of natural processes, but of human vulnerability.

If you don’t get the kind of information failure 
provides, you’ll end up with unrealistic expectations for 
yourself, explains a psychologist. You could wind up in 
a position where failure, which has gathered under cover 
of darkness, reveals itself all at once. 
We should hope, then, for exposure to failure, early 
and often. The sociologist Glen Elder proposed that 
there is a sensitive period for growth late teens 
through early 30s during which failures are most 
beneficial. Such a pattern seems to promote the trait 
sometimes called equanimity. We learn that trauma is 
survivable, so we don’t plunge too deeply following 
setbacks. Nor, conversely, do we soar too high on our 
successes. Some businesses in Silicon Valley and on 
Wall Street make a point of hiring ex-pro athletes to 
their staffs. It’s not just that their high profile draws 
business. It’s because athletes are good at recovering 
from their failures. “We needed people who could 
perform and not get emotionally attached to losses,” a 
Chicago oil trader told the New York Times, explaining 
why the firm likes athletes on the trading floor, 
particularly in ugly economic times like these. The 
image is of a rider easy in the saddle. Nothing can so 
surprise her either for good or ill that she’ll be 
knocked off.
One way to help keep life’s slings and arrows from 
knocking you off course is to ensure your life is 
, says Stephen Berglas, a California 
psychologist and personal coach. That way, a setback in 
any one area won’t mean in your mind that you’re a 
failure categorically. Call it spreading your risk across 
your emotional portfolio or adding another leg to the 
furniture for balance, says Berglas.

To be creative problem solvers, people must learn to 
approach complexity with a certain naive simplicity. And 
by letting their thinking become more free, they can 
improve their chances of discovering new unencumbered 
perceptions of old problems or entirely new creations. 
For this, they can mentally play with the ideas in a 
childlike manner. Here is an example story. In a small 
Moravian village at the time of the old Austrian empire, 
an inspector from the Ministry of Education arrived one 
day to visit the schoolroom. It was part of (a) his duty 
to make such periodic inspections of the schools.
* unencumbered:
(B)
At the end of the hour, after he had observed the 
class, he stood up and said: “I am glad to see that you 
children are doing well in your studies. I am satisfied 
with your progress. Therefore, before I go, there is one 
question I would like to ask. How many hairs does a 
horse have?” Very quickly one little nine-year-old boy 
raised his hand, to the astonishment of the teacher and 
the visitor. (b) He stood up and said, “The horse has 
3,571,962 hairs.” The inspector wonderingly asked, “And 
how do you know that this is the right number?” The 
boy replied, “If you do not believe me, you could count 
them yourself.” 
(C)
It was a year later, and the inspector was back again 
at the village school for his annual visit. As the teacher 
was walking along the aisle with (c) him to the door, he 
stopped and said, “By the way, Mr. Inspector, how did 
your colleagues like the story of the horse and the 
number of his hairs?” The inspector slapped the teacher 
on the back. “Oh yes,” he said, “you know, I was 
really very anxious to tell that story and a fine story 
it was but you see, I wasn’t able for the life of me 
to remember the number of hairs.”
(D)
The inspector broke into loud laughter, thoroughly 
enjoying the boy’s remark. As the teacher escorted (d) him 
along the aisle to the door, still laughing heartily, he 
said: “What an amusing story! I must tell this story to 
my colleagues when I return to Vienna. I can already see 
how they will take it; they enjoy nothing better than a 
good joke.” And with that, he took (e) his leave.
