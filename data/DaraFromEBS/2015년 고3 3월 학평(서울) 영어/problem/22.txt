22. The body is like a symphony where thousands of 
metabolic actions are orchestrated into harmony through the 
constant fine­tuning of conscious (e.g. exercise) and 
subconscious (e.g. digestion) instructions. When the harmony 
is broken, the body sends us information, signals and 
symptoms, in very direct and obvious ways. It is necessary 
that we pay attention to these signals instead of viewing 
them as burdens in our life. If we ignore or suppress health 
symptoms, they will become progressively louder and more 
extreme as the body attempts to capture our attention. 
When the oil light comes on in our car, do we disconnect 
the light, or do we take the car in for service? We usually 
take our car to the shop at the first sign of trouble. 
However, when it comes to our health, how many of us wait 
until the situation becomes serious before taking action?
