28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
Coming home from work the other day, I saw a woman 
trying to turn onto the main street and ① having very little 
luck because of the constant stream of traffic. I slowed and 
allowed her to turn in front of me. I was feeling pretty good 
until, a couple of blocks later, she stopped to let a few more 
cars into the line, causing us both to miss the next light. I 
found myself completely ② irritated with her. How dare she 
slow me down after I had so graciously let her into the 
traffic! As I was sitting there stewing, I realized ③ how 
ridiculous I was being. Suddenly, a phrase I once read ④ came 
floating into my mind: ‘You must do him or her a kindness for 
inner reasons, not because someone is keeping score or 
because you will be punished if you don’t.’ I realized ⑤what I 
had wanted a reward: If I do this nice thing for you, you (or 
someone else) will do an equally nice thing for me.
