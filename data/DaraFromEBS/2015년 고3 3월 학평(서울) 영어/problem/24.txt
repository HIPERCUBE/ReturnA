24. Derek Parra에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
In 1995, Derek Parra was the best inline skater in the 
world, with eighteen world titles to his credit and a 
projection of many more to come. He was the king of his 
domain. However, there was a problem. Inline skating isn’t 
included in the Olympics and Parra dreamed of winning an 
Olympic gold medal. So, at the age of twenty­five, he 
switched to the sport of speedskating, a cousin of inline 
skating but with two important differences: you race on 
skates instead of wheels and on ice instead of asphalt. 
There was nothing easy about the switch. Parra had grown 
up in southern California and had hardly ever seen any ice, 
let alone spent any time on it. Overnight, he went from 
being No. 1 in the world to just somebody in the back of 
the pack. However, he stuck to his goals and persisted in 
making the transition, and in the 2002 Winter Olympic 
Games in Salt Lake City, he won his Olympic gold medal.
