Reading has also always had a social dimension, however, 
as it does in our early lives: our first acts of reading are 
performed with parents and teachers standing by and 
guiding us.

self, and away from the world of distractions; but it also 
furnishes us with far­reaching connections to other people.

always converse, by implication, with the book’s author.
