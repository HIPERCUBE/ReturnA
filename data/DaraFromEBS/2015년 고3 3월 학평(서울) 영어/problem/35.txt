Animals may have a limited understanding of what is 
happening now, but only humans seem to enrich their 
understanding of the present by thoughtful links to events in 
the distant past and future. Indeed, human goals often link 
what one does now to possible outcomes that lie years 
away. ① Thus, human action is not just a here­and­now 
response but is often designed to help bring about something 
far off, such as graduation or marriage or retirement. ② It 
can also be linked to things that have happened elsewhere 
or long ago, such as when people celebrate Independence 
Day or a religious holiday. ③ Moreover, people often follow 
the rules made in distant places by people they will never 
meet. ④ Different societies make different rules, so it’s hard 
to say which rules are more natural than others. ⑤ Most 
Americans pay income tax, for example, though few have 
any direct contact with the people who make the tax laws.
