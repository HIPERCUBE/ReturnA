For example, if you say “I’m going to the bank to deposit 
some money,” I don’t expect you to go to the river bank.
Often, a word is used with more than one meaning. Indeed, 
a brief look at a dictionary will show you that the majority of 
words are used with more than one meaning. ( ① ) If such 
words were said to be ambiguous, then the vast majority of 
words would be ambiguous. ( ② ) However, linguists and 
philosophers usually call a word “ambiguous” only when there 
is some uncertainty about which meaning is being used in the 
particular instance. ( ③ ) A word isn’t ambiguous by itself but 
is used ambiguously: it is ambiguous when one cannot tell from 
the context what sense is being used. ( ④ ) However, in most 
cases one can tell from the context what sense is being 
used. ( ⑤ ) The word “bank” has these two senses (and more), 
but it is not thereby ambiguous: the two senses are so 
unrelated that no one is likely to confuse them.
