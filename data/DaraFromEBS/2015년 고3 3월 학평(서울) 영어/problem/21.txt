21. Researcher Jack Greenberg studied how employees from 
various career sectors perceived their performance 
evaluation. He found that, regardless of the industry, it was 
incredibly important for employees to feel that they were 
active participants in the evaluation process. The employees 
were more likely to feel that the process was fair when 
supervisors requested their input prior to an evaluation and 
used it during the process, when there was two­way 
communication during the evaluation interviews, and when 
the employees had the chance to challenge the evaluation. In 
other words, if the employees were involved in their 
evaluation, they felt it was fairer.
