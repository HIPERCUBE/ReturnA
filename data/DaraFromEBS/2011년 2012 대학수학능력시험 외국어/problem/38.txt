38. Giorgio Vasari에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
Giorgio Vasari, the Italian painter, architect, and writer, 
was born in Arezzo in 1511. He was considered to be more 
successful as an architect than a painter. But what made 
him truly famous was his book Lives of the Most Eminent 
Painters, Sculptors and Architects (shortened as Lives). It is 
not known exactly how many copies of the first edition of 
Lives, published in 1550, were printed, but it earned Vasari 
the praise of his peers. Then in a revised edition of Lives 
in 1568, complete with portraits of the artists, he combined 
biographical anecdotes with critical comment. Although the 
revised edition overshadowed Vasari’s own achievements as 
a painter and architect, it made him the most respected man 
of the Italian art world. He was even knighted by Pope 
Pius Ⅴ in 1571.
