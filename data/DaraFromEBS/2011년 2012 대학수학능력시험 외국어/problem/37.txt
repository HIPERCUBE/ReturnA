Marking the Nepal-Tibet border, Everest looms as a 
three-sided pyramid of gleaming ice and dark rock. The 
first eight expeditions to Everest were British, all of which 
attempted the mountain from the northern, Tibetan, side ― 
not because it presented the most obvious weakness in the 
peak’s formidable defenses but because in 1921 the 
Tibetan government opened its borders to foreigners, while 
Nepal remained off limits. The first Everesters were obliged 
to trek 400 miles from Darjeeling across the Tibetan plateau 
to reach the foot of the mountain. Their knowledge of the 
deadly effects of extreme altitude was limited and their 
equipment was poor. Yet in 1924, a member of the third 
British expedition, Edward Felix Norton, reached an elevation 
of 28,126 feet ― just 900 feet below the summit ― before 
being defeated by exhaustion and snow blindness. It was an 
astounding achievement that was not surpassed for 28 years.
