35. All of us use the cultural knowledge we acquire as 
members of our own society to organize our perception 
and behavior. Most of us are also naive realists: we tend 
to believe our culture mirrors a reality shared by 
everyone. But cultures are different, and other people 
rarely behave or interpret experience according to our 
cultural plan. For example, an American anthropologist 
attempted to tell the classic story of Hamlet to Tiv elders 
in West Africa. She believed that human nature is pretty 
much the same the whole world over; at least the general 
plot and motivation of the great tragedy would always be 
clear. But, at each turn in the story when she told it, the 
Tiv interpreted the events and motives in Hamlet using 
their own cultural knowledge. The result was a very 
different version of the classic play.
