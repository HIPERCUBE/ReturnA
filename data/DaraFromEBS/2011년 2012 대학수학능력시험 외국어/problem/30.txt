30. Often in social scientific practice, even where evidence 
is used, it is not used in the correct way for adequate 
scientific testing. In much of social science, evidence is 
used only to affirm a particular theory ― to search for 
the positive instances that uphold it. But these are easy 
to find and lead to the familiar dilemma in the social 
sciences where we have two conflicting theories, each of 
which can claim positive empirical evidence in its support 
but which come to opposite conclusions. How should we 
decide between them? Here the scientific use of evidence 
may help. For what is distinctive about science is the 
search for negative instances ― the search for ways to 
falsify a theory, rather than to confirm it. The real power 
of scientific testability is negative, not positive. Testing 
allows us not merely to confirm our theories but to

① ignore the evidence against them
② falsify them by using positive empirical evidence
③ intensify the argument between conflicting theories
④ weed out those that do not fit the evidence
⑤ reject those that lack negative instances
