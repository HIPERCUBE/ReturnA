Mediation is a process that has much in common with 
advocacy but is also crucially different. It parallels 
advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of 
negotiation, but differs in so far as mediation involves 
adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties  
rather than taking up the case of one party against 
another. At times, particularly in very complex 
situations, the processes of advocacy and mediation can 
overlap, perhaps with very problematic results, as one 
loses clarity over his or her role. It is therefore 
important, if not essential, to maintain a clear focus in 
undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure 
that the roles do not become blurred and therefore 
potentially counterproductive. For example, a mediator 
who ‘takes sides’ is likely to lose all credibility, as is 
an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position.
