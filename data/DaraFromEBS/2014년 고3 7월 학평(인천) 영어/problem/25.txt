Whether an animal can feel anything resembling the loneliness 
humans feel is hard to say. However, highly social animals, such 
as certain types of parrot, seem to be ①adversely affected when 
kept alone. Some parrots will engage in bizarre behaviors and 
can severely harm themselves. Some large parrots will even 
seem to go insane if subjected to long periods of ② isolation. On 
the other hand, certain animals that are by nature ③solitary 
hardly appear to be affected at all. Some fish, in particular some 
types of cichlids, will even ④fight viciously with their own kind 
if more than one is kept in an aquarium. Guam rails, a kind of 
flightless bird, are ⑤tolerant of their own kind, which has 
obviously made breeding them in captivity very difficult.
