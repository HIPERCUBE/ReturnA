A planning discussion can be fairly complex and 
fast­paced, causing us to forget things. Take the time to 
summarize what’s supposed to happen. It could sound 
something like this: “Let me see if I got this right. Bill, 
you’ll get the nine copies of the report, stapled with a 
standard company cover sheet, for the meeting Tuesday at 2 p.m. 
Is that right?” Bill would probably say, “Right,” and then you 
could ask him whether there is anything else that you 
haven’t talked about that might cause a problem. When you 
ask for the other person’s input, it can help bring to light 
issues that might otherwise cause problems. However, the 
real power of this question goes far beyond clarifying 
understanding. You’re checking for commitment. When the 
other person eventually says, “I’ll do it,” that person is much 
more likely to live up to the agreement. Never walk away 
from a crucial confrontation satisfied with a vague nod. If 
you care about gaining genuine commitment, give the other 
person the opportunity to say yes to a very specific 
agreement.
