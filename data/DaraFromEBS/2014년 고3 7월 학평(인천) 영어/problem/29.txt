29. Brian Boyle에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
In 2004, an eighteen­year­old competitive swimmer, Brian 
Boyle, had to be brought back to life eight times after a dump 
truck slammed into his car on his way home from swim 
practice. The force of the horrific crash damaged every major 
organ in his body. Doctors predicted he would not survive, let 
alone walk again. But, miraculously, Brian clawed his way back 
to the living and gradually recovered. In 2007, Brian Boyle 
staged what many consider to be one of the greatest comebacks 
in sports history when he crossed the finish line at the Hawaii 
Ironman just three years after leaving the Intensive Care Unit. 
In 2009, he published his first book, Iron Heart, and he was 
presented the Spokesperson of the Year Award from the 
American Red Cross for his contributions. In 2010, he graduated 
Cum Laude from St. Mary’s College of Maryland, and also made 
his very first blood donation at the hospital that brought him 
back to life. Brian now dedicates his life to competing in 
triathlons and giving back to the donors who saved him.
