The blue sea slug is a strange­looking marine creature found 
in the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, 
and Indian Oceans. With the aid of a gas­filled sac in its 
stomach, the blue sea slug floats at the surface. Due to the 
location of the gas sac, the blue sea slug floats upside down. 
They live a pelagic life ―this means they go where the winds 
and currents take them. Blue sea slugs feed mainly on 
hydrozoans although they are also known to eat the flesh of 
their own kind. One of the specialities of their diet is the 
highly poisonous Portuguese Man­O­War. The blue sea slug can 
not only swallow its prey’s stinging cells without hurting itself, 
but also store the swallowed poison inside the up to 84 
finger­like structures sticking out of its body, and then use this 
poison to defend itself against other predators. The blue sea 
slug is a hermaphrodite, having both male and female 
reproductive organs.
