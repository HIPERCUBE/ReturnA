Understanding networks can lead to innovative, 
non­obvious strategies. Randomly immunizing a population 
to prevent the spread of infection typically requires that 
80 to 100 percent of the population be immunized.
(A) This strategy allows us to exploit a property of networks 
even if we cannot see the whole structure. Acquaintances 
have more links and are more central to the network than 
are the randomly chosen people who named them. 
(B) To prevent measles epidemics, for example, 95 percent of 
the population must be immunized. A more efficient 
alternative is to target the hubs of the network, namely, 
those people at the center of the network or those with 
the most contacts. 
(C) However, it is often not possible to discern network ties 
in advance in a population when trying to figure out how 
best to immunize it. A creative alternative is to immunize 
the acquaintances of randomly selected individuals. [3점]
