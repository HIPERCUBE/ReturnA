People love to tell others what to do; they believe giving 
advice is ‘helpful,’ even if the advice is not requested. Such 
telling worked in the Industrial Era because it was hierarchical 
in structure. This communication style implied the teller 
inherently had valuable information to provide and knew the 
correct solution. In the Information Age, people have more 
equal access to knowledge and, with the help of technology, are 
generally able to find their own solutions. If someone wants 
advice, they will ask for it. In general, telling is no longer well 
received. It can be perceived as lacking in respect, narrowing 
opportunities and shutting down possibilities by implying 
that the individual is incapable of solving a problem.
