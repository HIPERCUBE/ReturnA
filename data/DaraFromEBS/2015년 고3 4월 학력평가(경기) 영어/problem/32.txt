32. We tend not to notice how many creative tasks benefit from constraints because they are built　in and have become invisible. 
For example, almost all popular music is in 4/4 time, four beats 
in the bar, with the emphasis usually landing on the first beat. 
Tracks are normally three or four minutes in length, contain a 
chorus, and so on. These are just a few constraints of many that 
popular music follows, and yet look at the variation that can be 
achieved. Many songs break these rules, but they often achieve 
their effects because there is a rule to break in the first place. 
Painters, writers, artists, and so on are all influenced by 
previous styles to various degrees and it’s these previous styles 
that provide constraints. The very limitations we impose on 
ourselves can be                                                     　  . [3점]
