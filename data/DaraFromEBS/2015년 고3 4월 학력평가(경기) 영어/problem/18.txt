Dear Sir or Madam:
I am writing to you regarding a price discrepancy I 
encountered between an item offered in your retail 
store and the same item offered on your website. I 
recently ordered an outfit from your online store, item 
#N4A8-BL. The price listed on the site was $109, 
which was paid by credit card. Please take a look at the 
attached receipt. Three days later, while shopping at 
our local mall, I visited one of your retail shops and 
found the exact same outfit priced at $79. I would like 
to ask for a refund of the price difference. I am assuming 
that this would be a better solution to packing up the 
outfit and shipping it back to you for a full refund.
Sincerely,
Patricia Cavelli
