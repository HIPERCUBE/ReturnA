Unlike books and paintings, music speaks to us through a 
re-creator, a musician who makes the printed music sound. A 
composition, even a familiar one, can be a new experience each 
time it’s performed. It is the job of the performer to bring life 
to the printed symbols laid out by a composer. Just how loud is 
a chord marked 𝑓? How fast is a section labeled allegro? No 
matter how many specific indications of rhythm, dynamics, 
or accent appear on a page, much is left to the performer. Like 
that of an actor, his or her interpretation is full of subtle 
timings and inflections. Performers project to　 an audience a 
mixture of their own feelings and the composer’s intentions. 
Critics sometimes say about a particularly convincing 
interpretation that a performer is ‘identified’ with a work and 
its composer. That’s how close the relationship can be.
