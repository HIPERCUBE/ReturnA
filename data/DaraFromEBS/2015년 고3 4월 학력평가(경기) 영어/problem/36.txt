36. Food is neither good nor bad in the absolute, though we have 
been taught to recognize it as such. The organ of taste is not 
the tongue, but the brain, a culturally (and therefore 
historically) determined organ through which the criteria for 
evaluations are transmitted and learned. ① Therefore, these 
criteria vary in space and in time. ② What in one era is judged 
positively, in another can change meaning; what in one locale 
is considered tasty, in another can be rejected as disgusting. 
③ Very often times, the failure to detect spoiled or toxic food 
can lead to serious health problems. ④ Definitions of taste 
belong to the cultural heritage of human society. ⑤ As there 
are differing tastes and preferences among different peoples 
and regions of the world, so do tastes and preferences evolve 
over the course of centuries. [3점]
