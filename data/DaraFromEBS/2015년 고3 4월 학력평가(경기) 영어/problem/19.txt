Some of the words we use most frequently are not 
expressive. If someone asked you what you thought of a movie 
or your dinner, you might respond: “It was fine.” Do you mean, 
‘fine’ as in ‘fine wine,’ or ‘fine art?’ Or do you mean, ‘fine’ as in 
‘excellent, good, fine or poor?’ ‘Fine’ can be used to express 
satisfaction or disappointment. There are hundreds of words 
that, like ‘fine,’ express very little meaning. They are fillers. 
Choose words that are more expressive, like ‘great’ or ‘terrific’ 
or ‘wonderful’ if you want to express pleasure, and words like 
‘adequate’ or ‘satisfactory’ if your intent is to communicate that 
the movie or meal was okay, but nothing more. These words 
won’t be misunderstood.
