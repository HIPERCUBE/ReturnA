James Gibbs is best known for his successful blending of 
Renaissance and Baroque architectural elements into an 
early-18th century Neo-Classicism. He was born in Scotland 
and studied in Rome under the Late Baroque Italian architect 
Carlo Fontana. Returning to England in 1709, he was appointed 
a member of the commission authorized to build 50 churches in 
London. Between 1722 and 1726 Gibbs constructed his most 
famous church, Saint Martin-in-the-Fields, which has a spire 
rather than a dome rising from the roof of the building. Of 
Gibbs’ later works the circular ‘Radcliffe Camera’ library at 
Oxford University is his most ambitious and monumental 
achievement. His architectural style has influenced the 
architecture of churches in England and the United States.
