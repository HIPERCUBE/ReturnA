Permission marketing is a term coined by Seth Godin, 
meaning that the customer has given his or her consent to 
receive marketing messages from an organization.
(A) It is no coincidence that they are commonly referred to in 
the negative terms ‘junk mail’ and ‘spam,’ because they are 
unwelcome. All too often the final result is a frustrated 
customer with no intention of buying and a marketer who 
has wasted his budget ― ‘lose-lose.’
(B) As such, the customer is more receptive to the 
organization because the messages are anticipated, 
personal, and relevant. The opposite of permission 
marketing is interruption marketing, which Godin claims, 
can lead to a ‘lose-lose’ situation.
(C) Interruption marketing occurs when the customer receives 
unrequested direct marketing messages, such as direct 
mail, telephone calls, e-mails, and text messages. Godin 
argues that these things often end up wasting the 
customer’s time and therefore lead to frustration. [3점]
