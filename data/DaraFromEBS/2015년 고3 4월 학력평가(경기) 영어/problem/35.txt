35. Enough sunlight falls on Earth to meet our energy needs ten 
thousand times over. However, it’s highly dispersed. ① Various 
technologies already exist to concentrate the sunlight using 
curved mirrors and focus it on tanks of liquid ― usually water 
or oil. ② If you’re lucky enough to live in a sunny part of the 
country, solar heating panels like these are an excellent way to 
heat water for individual homes. ③ They sit on the roof rather 
like a satellite dish and provide baths and showers that are 
satisfyingly hot and guilt-free. ④ However, Earth is not the 
only planet that receives solar radiation. ⑤ Solar heating can 
also be used on a much larger scale, by making the hot liquid 
drive an engine to generate electricity.
