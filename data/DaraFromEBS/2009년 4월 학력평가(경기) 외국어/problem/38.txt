38.  If you bang your knee on the car door getting out of the car, 
you really feel it. Your knee is sore. You don’t deny it or repress 
it. You feel it. However, you also know that there are more 
important things to think about in your office than your sore 
knee. In fact, you can probably still go inside and do what you 
were going to do despite the sore knee. And if you really get 
enthused about what you’re doing, the awareness of the sore 
knee disappears, and you hardly think about it again. This is a 
very healthy way to deal with physical pain. Although you pay 
attention to it, you always know that there’s more to you than 
the pain. You, in effect, forget it. It’s your lifelong habit. And 
the habit serves you.
