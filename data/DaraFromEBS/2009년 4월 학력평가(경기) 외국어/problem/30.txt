We drove there after dinner, filled ourselves with tea, and then 
set out, all four of us, to take a walk through the grove. 
Bizmionkov took old lady Ozhogina’s arm; I, Liza’s. The day was 
already giving way to evening. I was then at the very height of 
first love, in that state of passionate and intense admiration. 
Until that day I had never had a chance to take Liza by the arm. 
We went along together, side by side, quietly walking across the 
green grass. A light breeze seemed to be fluttering around us, 
among the white trunks of the birches, from time to time tossing 
the ribbon of her hat into my face. I persistently followed her 
with my eyes until, finally, she turned cheerfully to me, and we 
both smiled at each other. My head was spinning from an excess 
of pleasure. The birds sang approvingly above us, the blue sky 
pierced gently through the fine leaves.
