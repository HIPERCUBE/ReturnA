At first, it would perhaps crawl a few inches there, but soon 
be exhausted by　the enormous gravitational pull of the planet.
It is believed that the life-forms on this planet first evolved in 
the sea. ( ① ) When there were no animals yet to be found on 
land, the sea was already filled with life. ( ② ) Then at some 
point, one of the sea creatures must have started to venture onto 
dry land. ( ③ ) So it would return to the water, where gravity is 
almost nonexistent and where it could live with much greater 
ease. ( ④ ) And then it tried again and again, and much later 
would adapt to life on land, grow feet instead of fins, and develop 
lungs instead of gills. ( ⑤ ) What made fish leave their habitat 
and evolve may have been a large sea area that got cut off from 
the main ocean where the water gradually receded over 
thousands of years.
