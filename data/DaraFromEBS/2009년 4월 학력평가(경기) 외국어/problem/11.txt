It is a small sum of money periodically given to children by 
their parents, typically on a weekly or monthly basis. Their 
parents allow them a fixed amount of money within a given 
period of time. It is a way for children to learn about handling 
money and about saving or spending. Most children can begin to 
understand these ideas at age six or seven, and so that is a good 
time to start giving it. Often parents demand that certain 
household duties such as cleaning or sharing be done as a 
condition of receiving it, in an attempt to teach their children 
about responsibility. Earning it can teach children to understand 
how the economic system works.

19. 밑줄 친 she가 가리키는 대상이 나머지 넷과 다른 것은?
Every Sunday evening Jane’s mother opened the little square 
piano and picked out hymns. Those evenings on which ① she 
opened it were the happiest hours of Jane’s childhood. Whenever　
② she started toward the instrument, Jane used to follow her 
with great interest and irrepressible joy. Jane’s mother used to 
allow her to sit by her side and sometimes ③ she would even let 
Jane interrupt her by chiming in with strange harmonies. Always 
on such evenings, when the music was over,　④ she would hold 
Jane close. Many and many a night　⑤ she thus fell asleep in her 
mother’s arms. The memory of that picture has more than once 
kept her from straying too far from the place of purity and safety 
in which her mother’s arms held her.

When we enter a room, we immediately recognize the floor, 
chairs, furniture, tables, and so forth. But when a robot scans 
a room, it sees nothing but a vast collection of straight and 
curved lines, (A) which / what it converts to pixels. It takes 
an enormous amount of computing time to make sense out of 
this jumble of lines. A computer sees only a collection of 
circles, ovals, spirals, straight lines, curly lines, corners, and 
so on. (B) Spending / Spent an enormous amount of computing 
time, a robot might finally recognize the object as a table. But 
if you rotate the image, the computer has to start all over 
again. In other words, robots can see, and in fact they can see 
(C) much / very better than humans, but they don’t understand 
what they are seeing.

Although life is different from nonlife, it is not ① completely 
different. Living things exist in a nonliving universe and depend 
on ② it in many ways. Plants absorb energy from sunlight, and 
bats find shelter in caves. Indeed, living things are made of the 
same tiny particles ③ that make up nonliving things. What makes 
organisms different from the materials that compose them ④ are 
their level of organization. Living things exhibit not just one but 
many layers of biological organization. This tendency toward 
order is sometimes ⑤ modeled in a pyramid of life.

The dream of employing beams of energy is actually not new. 
The concept of using rays as a practical weapon is shown 
through history and in old films. ① In 214 B.C., Archimedes is 
believed to have created large batteries of solar reflectors that 
focused the sun’s rays onto the sails of enemy ships. ② Ray guns 
burst onto the science fiction scene in 1889 with H. G. Wells’s 
classic War of the Worlds, in which aliens from Mars devastate 
entire cities by shooting beams of heat energy. ③ In medical 
science, doctors typically take advantage of ultrasonic waves in 
surgical operations. ④ During World War II, the Nazis 
experimented with various forms of ray guns. ⑤ Weapons 
created from focused light beams entered the public imagination 
with the James Bond movie Goldfinger, the first Hollywood film 
to feature a laser.
24.  Most people know what a check is: an authorization to pay a 
designated amount of money out of an established account. But 
what does a check look like? The obvious answer is that it is a 
piece of paper and specially imprinted with the name and 
number of the bank. Although most checks would meet this 
description, not all checks have been so                  . Unless 
specific laws or regulations specify otherwise, any legitimate 
written authorization to pay money out of an account is an 
acceptable check. Thus, checks have been written on 
newspapers, handkerchiefs, and countless other unusual 
materials. A Canadian bank cashed a check written on the shell 
of a hard-boiled egg. A check of Manhattan Bank made of solid 
steel was so heavy that it had to be carried by two men.
① touchable ② diverse
③ counterfeit ④ inconvenient
⑤ conventional
25.  Umbrellas and automobiles are different. Not just because of 
size, function, and cost, but for a reason we seldom stop to 
consider. A person can use an umbrella without buying another 
product. An automobile, by contrast, cannot be used without 
fuel, repair services, and spare parts. The umbrella, therefore, is 
an individual, so to speak, delivering value to its user 
irrespective of any other products. The auto, by contrast, is        
. It completely depends on other products. So do  
tape recorders, refrigerators, and thousands of other products 
that work only when combined with others. The television set 
would stare blankly into the living room if someone somewhere 
were not transmitting images to it. 
① a team player ② a status symbol
③ a necessary evil ④ a modern convenience
⑤ a must-have device
26.  We’re constantly making decisions, ranging from what to eat 
for dinner each night to whom we should marry, not to mention 
all those flavors of ice cream. We base many of our decisions on 
whether we think a particular preference will increase our 
well-being. Intuitively, we seem convinced that the more 
choices we have, the better off we’ll ultimately be. But our 
world of unlimited opportunity                                               . 
In what one psychologist calls “the paradox of choice,” facing 
many possibilities leaves us stressed out, and less satisfied with 
whatever we do decide. Having too many choices keeps us 
wondering about all the opportunities missed.
① imprisons us more than it makes us happy
② introduces various leisure activities to us
③ offers a wide choice of business partners
④ encourages us to lead a happy life
⑤ helps us achieve our goals in life
27.  The standard written language that we know today was 
established during the early part of the Modern English period. 
The standardization of the language was due in the first place to 
the need of the central government for regular procedures by 
which to conduct its business, to keep its records, and to 
communicate with the citizens of the land. John H. Fisher argues 
that standard English was first the language of the Court of 
Chancery, founded in the fifteenth century to give prompt 
justice to English citizens and to consolidate the King’s influence 
in the nation. Standard languages are                                      , 
developed to meet a specific administrative need rather than 
spontaneous developments of the folk or the artifice of writers 
and scholars. [3점]

것은? 
The great awakening of Greek art to freedom took place 
between, roughly, 520 and 420 B.C. Toward the end of the fifth 
century, artists became fully (A) conscious / deprived of their 
power and mastery, and so did the public. An increasing number 
of people began to be interested in their work for its own sake, 
and not only for the sake of its religious or political functions. 
People compared the (B) merits / perils of the various ‘schools’ 
of art; that is to say, of the various methods, styles and traditions 
which distinguished the masters in different cities. There is no 
doubt that the comparison and competition between these schools 
(C) stimulated / simulated the artist to make ever greater 
efforts, and helped to create that variety which we admire in 
Greek art.
