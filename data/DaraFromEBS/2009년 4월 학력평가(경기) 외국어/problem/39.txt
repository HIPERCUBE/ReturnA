39.  Overgrazing of the savanna is one of the biggest factors in the 
shrinking of the lake, according to the scientists, Coe and Foley. 
“As the climate became drier, the vegetation that supported 
grazing livestock began to disappear. Vegetation has a big 
influence, especially in semiarid regions, in determining weather 
patterns,” said Foley. “The loss of vegetation in itself 
contributed to a drier climate.” The situation is a “domino 
effect,” the researchers say. Overgrazing reduces vegetation, 
which in turn reduces the ecosystem’s ability to recycle 
moisture back into the atmosphere. That contributes to the 
retreat of the monsoons. The consequent drought conditions 
have triggered a huge increase in the use of lake water for 
irrigation, while the Sahara has gradually edged southward.
