41.  In the past twenty years, the number of practicing doctors in 
America has nearly doubled. So you would think, with all those 
new doctors running around, that Americans would be consulting 
their medical professionals at every opportunity. They’re not. In 
fact, the biggest trend in American health care is DIYDs ―
Do-It-Yourself Doctors. These are people who research their 
own symptoms, diagnose their own illnesses, and administer 
their own cures. If they have to call on doctors at all, they either 
treat them like ATM machines for prescriptions they already 
“knew” they need, or they show up in their offices with 
full-color descriptions of their conditions, self-diagnosed on 
the medical websites.
