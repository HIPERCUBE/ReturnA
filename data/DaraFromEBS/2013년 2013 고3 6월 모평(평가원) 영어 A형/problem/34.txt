34. It is known that people are extremely limited in the amount 
of information that they can process at any given time. A 
common metaphor in early theories of attention is the concept 
of a bottleneck. This metaphor is especially appealing because 
it matches our understanding about attention. The narrow neck 
of a bottle restricts the flow into or out of the bottle. This kind 
of flow in the narrow passageway is similar to the way people 
process information. In other words, this bottleneck limits the 
of information to which we can pay attention. 
Thus, when one message is currently flowing through a 
bottleneck, the other messages must be left behind. [3점]
