When plants were first grouped together, it was merely for 
convenience. Even today, plants may be categorized together 
in unnatural groupings in order to make them easier to 
identify. (A) , some wildflower books arrange 
together all white-flowered species or all yellow-flowered 
species. However, such groupings do not reflect natural 
relationships and make it difficult to recognize family 
characteristics. We don’t infer that all persons with red hair 
are more closely related to each other than they are to those 
with dark hair; likewise, all long-haired dogs are not more 
closely related to each other than they are to short-haired 
dogs. Modern botanists, (B) , try to group plants 
according to their natural relationships.
