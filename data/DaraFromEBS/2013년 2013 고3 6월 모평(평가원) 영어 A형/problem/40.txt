Lemonade is the perfect refreshment on a sunny day, and 
it also contains a lot of vitamin C. Here’s a quick and easy 
way to make lemonade.
(A) Wash the lemons you’ve prepared and cut them in half. 
Then, squeeze out as much juice as you can into a bowl. 
You can squeeze the lemons by hand, but it’s easier if you 
use a lemon squeezer.
(B) Then simply mix together the lemon juice, sugar, and 
water in a jug, and stir. Pour it into a glass, add some ice, 
and enjoy your lemonade!
(C) Prepare four lemons, 100g of sugar, one liter of water, 
and some ice. You also need a bowl, a jug, and a spoon. 
Don’t forget to prepare a cutting board and a knife.
