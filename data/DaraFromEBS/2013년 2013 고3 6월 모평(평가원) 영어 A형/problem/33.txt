As Tom stood on stage at the school play, he could feel the 
watchful eyes of the audience. Being in the spotlight made him 
feel tense. He tried to deliver his lines as best as he could, but 
he could feel his voice shaking. Suddenly, he realized he had 
missed a sentence. Without going back, he went on as though 
nothing had happened. But by the time he finished, his hands 
felt sweaty and his heart was racing. No one commented on his 
mistake― apart from his drama teacher. “Well done,” the 
teacher said. “Acting is like learning to ride a bike. You may 
not get it perfect the first time. You may fall off a few times, 
yet each time you get back on you do it better. Your 
performance may not have been perfect, but it was great.” His 
teacher’s comforting words brought a smile to Tom’s face.
