The study also suggests that luck is a matter of
interpretation.
Successful people often say that “you make your own
luck,” and the results from a study suggest that this is true.
( ① ) If people believe that they are lucky, then they are
more likely to continue trying until they succeed at
something. ( ② ) Those who think they are unlucky, on the other

can never succeed. ( ④ ) When one of the subjects fell
down the stairs and broke his arm, he did not think that this
was unlucky. ( ⑤ ) On the contrary, he actually felt
extremely fortunate - if he had fallen differently, he might
have broken his neck.
