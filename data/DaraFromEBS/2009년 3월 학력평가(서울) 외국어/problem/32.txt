32. Trust is the basis of all transactions. It’s the basis of the
economy. World Bank economist Stephen Knack has long
studied the economics of trust. According to him, the huge
disparity in income between the United States and Somalia
can be explained entirely as a disparity in trust. Put
differently, the income enjoyed by the American people is
0.5 percent the result of hard work and 99.5 percent the
result of trust. While that sounds extreme, there’s something
to it if you consider how market transactions and business
activities are impossible without it. Without adequate trust,
the cost of transactions rises and there are even times when
mutually beneficial transactions cannot be realized.
