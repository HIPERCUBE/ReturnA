25. A new study suggests that kids might be at increased risk
of getting the disease of the lungs depending on
. Looking at more than 95,000
infants born from 1995 to 2000, researchers followed the
children through 2005. What they found was those born in
the autumn were nearly 30% more likely to get asthma. The
researchers say it’s because babies born in the fall months
are much more likely to get common wintertime infections.
At birth, infants have protection against certain diseases
because antibodies have passed from the mother to her
unborn baby. But the protection is temporary. So, as their
immunities fade, babies become more subject to infections,
especially in the winter months when all kinds of germs are
swirling through the air. * asthma 천식
