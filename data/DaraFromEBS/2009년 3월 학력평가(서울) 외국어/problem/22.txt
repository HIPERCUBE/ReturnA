In business settings, it’s really easy to forget ① to take
the time to say Thank­You, and yet, it’s an essential part of
interaction with others. It’s important to people that they
feel valid, important, and ② respected. Just as saying sorry
matters, so does ③ remember to thank those who help you
move forward. And I think it’s much nicer to send along a
physical card than an email. A personal note written by your
own hand matters ④ far more than a few lines of typing
into a window that’s so easily available at your fingertips.
One more thing: if you’re going to go this route, put in the
extra few minutes to purchase a nice card and ⑤ use a pen
that gives you a decent flow.
