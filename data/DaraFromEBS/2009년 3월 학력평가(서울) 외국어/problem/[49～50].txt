There is a famous psychology experiment to help us
understand how opinions and judgements can be formed.
The general experiment procedure was devised by Dr. Asch
in the U.S. What happens is this: A volunteer is asked to
join a group for the study of the discrimination of length.
And he goes to a room where a number of people and the
experimenter are seated. The volunteer doesn’t know that
the other people in the room are researchers working
together with the experimenter. A pair of cards is
introduced. On one of them there is a line and on the
other, three lines. Of these three, one is clearly longer than
the line on the other card, one is shorter and one the same
length. Seeing the cards, everyone is in turn asked which of
the three lines on the second card is equal to the line on
the first. They all pick - as they have been told to pick -
the wrong line. Last of all, comes the turn of our volunteer.
In many cases the volunteer, faced with the opinion of the
group, denies the plain evidence of his senses and picks the
same one as others do. This experiment shows even the
sane and ordinary people could be made to deny the
obvious facts, feeling the pressure to . The people
around you, “the pressure group” can have a great influence
on your judgement and decisions.
