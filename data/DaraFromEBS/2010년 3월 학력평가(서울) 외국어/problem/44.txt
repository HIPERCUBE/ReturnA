weed control can be found in Australia. Around 1787, a man
brought the prickly pear, a kind of cactus, into Australia.

North and South America to study enemies of the prickly
pears. After trials of several species, three billion eggs
of an Argentine moth were spread in Australia.

reopened to settlement and grazing. The whole operation
had cost less than a penny per acre.
