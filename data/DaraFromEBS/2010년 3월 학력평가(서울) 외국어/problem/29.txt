Would you like to see birds and fish playing together?
Secure two glass vessels having straight sides of the same
① height, one 25 inches in diameter (Figure 1) and the
other 17 inches (Figure 2). The smaller is placed within the
larger, the ② bottoms being covered with moss and
aquarium decorations. Fill the space between the vessels
with water. Cut a piece of copper screen into a ③ circular
form to cover the larger vessel, and hang a bird swing in the
center (Figure 3). Place the screen on top of the vessels so
that the swing will hang in the center of the inner vessel. A
④weight should be placed on top of the screen, over the
smaller vessel, to keep it from floating. Put your canary
birds in the ⑤ outer vessel and some goldfish in the water
between the vessels. Now you have a small world where
birds and fish seem to play together underwater (Figure 4).
