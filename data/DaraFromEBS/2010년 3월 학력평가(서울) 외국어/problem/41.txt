41. Take a liter of rice and pour it all at once through a
funnel and into an empty beaker. Note how long it takes.
Next, take the same rice and pour it, not all at once, but in
a smooth controlled flow and measure how long that process
takes. Which liter of rice gets through more quickly? The
second method takes nearly one-third less time. What
seems slower is actually faster. Likewise, a study conducted
at a jammed tunnel showed that when cars were allowed to
enter the tunnel in the usual way, with no restrictions, the
two-lane tunnel could handle 1,176 cars per hour. But in a
trial, the tunnel authorities limited the number of cars that
could enter the tunnel every two minutes to 44. The result?
The tunnel now handled 1,320 vehicles per hour.
