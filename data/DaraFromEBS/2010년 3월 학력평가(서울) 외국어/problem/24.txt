24. A speaker begins his presentation by reaching into his
pocket, holds up a twenty-dollar bill, and says, “This
twenty is for sale for exactly one dollar. Who wants to buy
it?” Would you leap to your feet to get his attention? Or
would you wait a few seconds, and after a hand or two goes
up, timidly raise your own? If you’re one of the hesitaters,
you’re normal. Once someone else is willing to take a
chance, then our greedy little hands pop up, and we tend to
go along. The faster others’ hands are raised, the greater
the desire, and the more likely we are to be part of it. Our
sense of the value of an object is reinforced by the
that has been created for that object.
