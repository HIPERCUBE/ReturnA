In 2007 scientists discovered a very strange flesh-eating
plant. This plant, called Nepenthes attenboroughii, is so large
that it can swallow and devour rats whole. They are lured
into its slipper-like mouth to drown or die of exhaustion
before being slowly dissolved by digestive enzymes. The
plant is green and red and has a stem that can grow up to
four feet long. It can only be found high up on the
windswept slopes of Mount Victoria in the Philippines. After
hearing of missionaries who had seen “whole rats” being
eaten by the shrub, botanists Stewart McPherson and
Alistair Robinson led a team of scientists to the Asian
nation and uncovered the rare species. This plant was named
after the naturalist broadcaster David Attenborough.
