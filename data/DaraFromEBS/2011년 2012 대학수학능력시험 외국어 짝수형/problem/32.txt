Until the 1920’s, there were only three competitive 
swimming strokes ─ freestyle, backstroke, and breaststroke ─ 
and each had specific rules that described how it was to 
be performed. The rules of breaststroke ① stated that 
both arms must be pulled together underwater and then 
recovered simultaneously back to the start of the pulling 
position to begin the next stroke. Most people interpreted 
this arm recovery to mean an ② underwater recovery. In 
the 1920’s, however, someone ③ challenged the rules and 
reinterpreted this arm recovery to be an out-of-the-water 
recovery. Since this new breaststroke was about 15%
④ slower, people using the conventional version couldn’t 
effectively compete. Something had to be done to solve 
the problem. Finally, this new stroke ─ now known as 
the ‘butterfly’ ─ won ⑤ recognition as the fourth swimming 
stroke, and became an Olympic event in 1956.
