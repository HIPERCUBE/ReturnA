One day in February 2009, Stephanie called Betty, 
① her best friend, who was the only employee of her 
business Best Wedding. Once again, they discussed the 
company’s expenses and dwindling revenue. But this time, 
Stephanie knew what she had to do. She gathered up her 
courage and told ② her friend and colleague: “I have to 
make this work. I have to let ③ you go.” Betty was hurt 
but wasn’t particularly surprised. In a businesslike fashion, 
the two women began figuring out how to disengage. 
Betty said she wanted to start her own event-planning 
business, and Stephanie agreed to let ④ her keep her 
existing clients, some photography, and documents and 
forms they had developed together. ⑤ She also gave Betty 
two months’ salary as severance pay.

On January 10, 1992, a ship (A) traveled / traveling

Researchers studied two mobile phone companies trying 
to solve a technological problem. One company developed 
what it called a ‘technology shelf,’ created by a small group 
of engineers, on which ① was placed possible technical 
solutions that other teams might use in the future. It also 
created an open-ended conversation among ② its engineers 
in which salespeople and designers were often included. 
The boundaries among business units were deliberately 
ambiguous because more than technical information was 
needed ③ to get a feeling for the problem. However, the 
other company proceeded with more seeming clarity and 
discipline, ④ dividing the problem into its parts. Different 
departments protected their territory. Individuals and teams, 
competing with each other, stopped sharing information. 
The two companies did eventually ⑤ solve the technological 
problem, but the latter company had more difficulty than 
the former.
22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
During the 1997 Kyoto negotiations, Brazil made a 
suggestion that has since become known as the Brazilian 
Proposal. ① Its idea was that countries should now share 
the burden of emissions cuts according to how historically 
responsible they were for the problem. ② In other words, 
we should calculate what concentration of greenhouse 
gases each country has put into the atmosphere over time 
and use those figures to allocate emissions cuts. ③ That 
would mean, for instance, that countries such as Germany 
and the United Kingdom, which have been emitting for 
longer than most countries, would bear a larger share 
than their current emissions implied. ④ Greenhouse gases 
have been known to absorb heat and hold this heat in the 
atmosphere, instead of reflecting it back into space. ⑤ It 
would also mean that big emitters that had developed 
their industries more recently, such as Australia, would 
bear less of a share.
23. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
It started out like any other day. I had no idea that I 
was in for one of the most terrifying experiences of my 
life. I headed to the beach and jumped on my surfboard 
and paddled out. I was about 150 yards off the beach, 
when I felt a sudden chill in the air followed by an 
uncomfortable stillness. Suddenly, I heard the lifeguard 
scream, “Get out of the water!” There was a certain panic 
in his voice that demanded attention. Then I saw something 
approaching me in the water. It was big and gray, and 
closing in on me fast. I tried to paddle back to shore but 
my arms and legs were paralyzed.
① amused ② ashamed ③ disappointed
④ flattered ⑤ frightened
24. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Many people use their cleverness to justify and excuse 
themselves for the messiness of their workspaces. They 
say things like, “I know where everything is.” Or they 
say non-humorous things such as, “A clean desk is a 
sign of a sick mind.” However, people who say they 
know where everything is turn out to be using a large 
amount of their mental capacity and creative energies 
remembering where they placed things, rather than doing 
the job. If they worked in a well-organized environment 
for any length of time, they would be surprised at how 
much more productive they were. If you have a tendency 
to attempt to explain a messy desk or work area, challenge 
yourself to work with a clean desk for an entire day. 
The result will amaze you.

25. What you do in the 15 to 30 minutes after eating your 
evening meal sends powerful signals to your metabolism. 
You’ll set the stage for more vigor throughout the evening 
hours along with a weight-loss benefit if you stay  
after your meal. Among many possible activities, walking 
is one of the easiest ways to get some minutes of exercise 
after a meal. In fact, research shows that if you walk 
after a meal, you may burn 15 percent more calories than 
if you walk the same time, distance, and intensity on an 
empty stomach.
① active ② alone ③ full
④ satisfied  ⑤ silent
26. Interestingly, people are more overconfident when they 
feel like they have control of the outcome ― even when 
this is clearly not the case. For example, it is documented 
that if people are asked to bet on whether a coin toss is 
heads or tails, most bet larger amounts if the coin is yet to 
be tossed. If the coin is tossed and the outcome is concealed, 
people will offer lower amounts when asked for bets. People 
act as if __________________________________________. 
In this case, control of the outcome is clearly an illusion. 
This perception occurs in investing, as well. Even without 
information, people believe the stocks they own will 
perform better than stocks they do not own. However, 
ownership of a stock only gives the illusion of having 
control of the performance of the stock.  [3점]  
① the amount of the bet will influence the outcome
② their involvement will somehow affect the outcome of the toss
③ there is a parallel between a coin toss and stock investments
④ their illusion will not disappear even after the coin is tossed
⑤ they can predict the outcome with credible information
27. The truth is that everyone has a story. Every person 
we meet has a story that can, in some way, inform us 
and help us as we live the story of our own lives. When 
we acknowledge this truth and begin to look at others as 
________________________________, we open ourselves 
up to new possibilities in our lives. In reality, the people 
who are most different from us probably have the most 
to teach us. The more we surround ourselves with people 
who are the same as we are, who hold the same views, 
and who share the same values, the greater the likelihood 
that we will shrink as human beings rather than grow. 
① rivals competing against us 
② reliable guidelines for conformity    
③ potential sources of valuable information 
④ members of the same interest group
⑤ attentive listeners of our life stories
28. Although there are numerous explanations for the fall 
of the Roman empire, the deeper cause lies in the declining 
fertility of its soil and the decrease in agricultural yields. 
Italy was densely forested at the beginning of Roman 
rule. By the end of the Roman Imperium, however, Italy 
had been stripped of forest cover. The timber was sold 
on the open market and the soil converted to crops and 
pastureland. The cleared soil was rich in minerals and 
nutrients and provided substantial production yields. 
Unfortunately, deforestation left the soil exposed to harsh 
weather. Wind blew across the barren landscapes and 
water ran down from the mountaintops and slopes, taking 
the soil with them. Overgrazing of livestock resulted in 
further deterioration of the soil. Consequently, Rome’s 
___________________ could not provide sufficient energy 
to maintain its infrastructure and the welfare of its 
citizens.
① dense forests
② climate changes
③ irrigation system 
④ declining population 
⑤ agricultural production 
29. The identical claim, expressed in two social contexts, 
may have different qualifiers. When talking among 
friends, you might say, “Lucé is the world’s finest 
restaurant.” When speaking to a group of French chefs, 
you might find yourself saying, “Lucé is an excellent 
restaurant, comparable to some of the best in France.” 
Why did you say it differently? Perhaps because you 
expected a different critical scrutiny in the two groups. 
Maybe because your           was strong 
enough for friends but not as strong among the most 
knowledgeable. In each instance, you communicated the 
extent to which you wanted to qualify your claim, to 
guard yourself by restricting the extent to which you are 
willing to be held accountable for the claim. 
① desire to win friendship
② confidence in the claim
③ appetite for French cuisine
④ support for others’ opinions
⑤ suspicion of popular beliefs 
30. Often in social scientific practice, even where evidence 
is used, it is not used in the correct way for adequate 
scientific testing. In much of social science, evidence is 
used only to affirm a particular theory ― to search for 
the positive instances that uphold it. But these are easy 
to find and lead to the familiar dilemma in the social 
sciences where we have two conflicting theories, each of 
which can claim positive empirical evidence in its support 
but which come to opposite conclusions. How should we 
decide between them? Here the scientific use of evidence 
may help. For what is distinctive about science is the 
search for negative instances ― the search for ways to 
falsify a theory, rather than to confirm it. The real power 
of scientific testability is negative, not positive. Testing 
allows us not merely to confirm our theories but to      
. [3점]
① ignore the evidence against them
② falsify them by using positive empirical evidence
③ intensify the argument between conflicting theories
④ weed out those that do not fit the evidence
⑤ reject those that lack negative instances
31. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
The term euphemism derives from a Greek word meaning 
‘to speak with good words’ and involves substituting a 
more pleasant, less objectionable way of saying something 
for a blunt or more direct way. Why do people use 
euphemisms? They do so probably to help smooth out the 
‘rough edges’ of life, to make the unbearable bearable 
and the offensive inoffensive. (A) , euphemisms 
can become dangerous when they are used to create 
misperceptions of important issues. (B) , a politician 
may indicate that one of his statements was ‘somewhat at 
variance with the truth,’ meaning that he lied. Even more 
serious examples include describing rotting slums as 
‘substandard housing,’ making the miserable conditions 
appear reasonable and the need for action less important.
(A) (B)
① However …… For example
② In short …… For example
③ That is …… Similarly
④ In addition …… Therefore
⑤ Nevertheless …… Similarly

않은 것은?
Until the 1920’s, there were only three competitive 
swimming strokes ─ freestyle, backstroke, and breaststroke ─ 
and each had specific rules that described how it was to 
be performed. The rules of breaststroke ① stated that 
both arms must be pulled together underwater and then 
recovered simultaneously back to the start of the pulling 
position to begin the next stroke. Most people interpreted 
this arm recovery to mean an ② underwater recovery. In 
the 1920’s, however, someone ③ challenged the rules and 
reinterpreted this arm recovery to be an out-of-the-water 
recovery. Since this new breaststroke was about 15%
④ slower, people using the conventional version couldn’t 
effectively compete. Something had to be done to solve 
the problem. Finally, this new stroke ─ now known as 
the ‘butterfly’ ─ won ⑤ recognition as the fourth swimming 
stroke, and became an Olympic event in 1956.

적절한 것은?
Even those of us who claim not to be materialistic 
can’t help but form attachments to certain clothes. Like 
fragments from old songs, clothes can (A) evoke / erase
both cherished and painful memories. A worn-thin dress 
may hang in the back of a closet even though it hasn’t 
been worn in years because the faint scent of pine that 
lingers on it is all that remains of someone’s sixteenth 
summer. A(n) (B) impractical / brand-new white scarf might 
be pulled out of a donation bag at the last minute because 
of the promise of elegance it once held for its owner. 
And a ripped T-shirt might be (C) rescued / forgotten  
from the dust rag bin long after the name of the rock 
band once written across it has faded. Clothes document 
personal history for us the same way that fossils chart 
time for archaeologists.
(A) (B) (C)
① evoke …… impractical …… rescued
② evoke …… impractical …… forgotten
③ evoke …… brand-new …… forgotten
④ erase …… impractical …… rescued
⑤ erase …… brand-new …… forgotten

34. Living things naturally return to a state of balance. 
When we are disturbed by forces acting on us, our inner 
machinery kicks in and returns us to a balanced state of 
equilibrium. Homeostasis is the word we use to describe 
the ability of an organism to maintain internal equilibrium 
by adjusting its physiological processes. Most of the 
systems in animal and human physiology are controlled 
by homeostasis. We don’t like to be off balance. We tend 
to keep things in a stable condition. This system operates 
at all levels. Our blood stays the same temperature. 
Except for extraordinary exceptions, when people find 
ways to intervene using methods more powerful than our 
tendency to equilibrium, our habits, behaviors, thoughts, 
and our quality of life stay pretty much the same too. 
① physical balance needed for mental equilibrium
② inner mechanisms to enhance the quality of life
③ general tendency of organisms to keep equilibrium
④ major differences in animal and human physiology
⑤ biological processes resulting from habitual behaviors
35. All of us use the cultural knowledge we acquire as 
members of our own society to organize our perception 
and behavior. Most of us are also naive realists: we tend 
to believe our culture mirrors a reality shared by 
everyone. But cultures are different, and other people 
rarely behave or interpret experience according to our 
cultural plan. For example, an American anthropologist 
attempted to tell the classic story of Hamlet to Tiv elders 
in West Africa. She believed that human nature is pretty 
much the same the whole world over; at least the general 
plot and motivation of the great tragedy would always be 
clear. But, at each turn in the story when she told it, the 
Tiv interpreted the events and motives in Hamlet using 
their own cultural knowledge. The result was a very 
different version of the classic play.

① cultural differences in perception and interpretation 
② tragic characteristics of classic West African plays 
③ the positive function of culture as a mirror of reality
④ human nature and its role in developing culture
⑤ the process of acquiring cultural knowledge

The graphs above show the percentage of world 
electricity generation by sources of energy for 1971 and 
2007. ① According to the graphs, the primary source of 
electricity generation in both 1971 and 2007 was coal 
and peat, accounting for over 40% of the total electricity 
generation. ② Oil showed the biggest decrease in electricity 
generation, which fell from 20.9% in 1971 to 5.6% in 
2007. ③ The source that showed the biggest increase was 
nuclear, which rose from 2.1% in 1971 to 13.8% in 
2007. ④ In 1971, hydro was the second biggest source of 
electricity generation, but in 2007, gas was the second 
biggest, accounting for more than 20% of the total 
electricity generation. ⑤ Besides coal and peat, hydro was 
the only source that accounted for more than 20% of the 
total electricity generation in both 1971 and 2007.
37. 1920년대 Everest  등반에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 
것은?
Marking the Nepal-Tibet border, Everest looms as a 
three-sided pyramid of gleaming ice and dark rock. The 
first eight expeditions to Everest were British, all of which 
attempted the mountain from the northern, Tibetan, side ― 
not because it presented the most obvious weakness in the 
peak’s formidable defenses but because in 1921 the 
Tibetan government opened its borders to foreigners, while 
Nepal remained off limits. The first Everesters were obliged 
to trek 400 miles from Darjeeling across the Tibetan plateau 
to reach the foot of the mountain. Their knowledge of the 
deadly effects of extreme altitude was limited and their 
equipment was poor. Yet in 1924, a member of the third 
British expedition, Edward Felix Norton, reached an elevation 
of 28,126 feet ― just 900 feet below the summit ― before 
being defeated by exhaustion and snow blindness. It was an 
astounding achievement that was not surpassed for 28 years.
① 처음 여덟 팀의 등반대는 Nepal  쪽에서 등반을 시작했다.
② 최초의 등반대는 Tibet 고원 지대를 우회하여 산기슭에 도달
했다.
③ 최초의 등반대는 극한 고도의 치명적 영향에 관한 지식이 
충분했다.
④ 1924년에 Edward Felix Norton이 정상의 900피트 아래 
지점까지 올랐다. 
⑤ Edward Felix Norton의 등반 기록은 이듬해에 경신되었다.
38. Giorgio Vasari에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
Giorgio Vasari, the Italian painter, architect, and writer, 
was born in Arezzo in 1511. He was considered to be more 
successful as an architect than a painter. But what made 
him truly famous was his book Lives of the Most Eminent 
Painters, Sculptors and Architects (shortened as Lives). It is 
not known exactly how many copies of the first edition of 
Lives, published in 1550, were printed, but it earned Vasari 
the praise of his peers. Then in a revised edition of Lives 
in 1568, complete with portraits of the artists, he combined 
biographical anecdotes with critical comment. Although the 
revised edition overshadowed Vasari’s own achievements as 
a painter and architect, it made him the most respected man 
of the Italian art world. He was even knighted by Pope 
Pius Ⅴ in 1571.
① Arezzo에서 태어난 이탈리아 화가, 건축가 겸 작가였다.  
② Lives의 초판본으로 동료들로부터 칭송을 받았다.  
③ Lives의 개정판에 예술가들의 전기적 일화와 비평을 함께 실었다.
④ Lives의 개정판으로 이탈리아 예술계에서 존경을 받지 못하게 
되었다.
⑤ 1571년에 교황으로부터 기사 작위를 받았다.

39. The good news is that it’s never too late to start building 
up muscle strength, regardless of your age. Ideally, though, 
it’s best to start in your mid-forties when muscle mass 
starts to decline significantly. “Once you’ve started, it can 
take just six weeks to see an improvement of up to 20 
percent in your muscle capabilities,” says Dr. Ward. Studies 
have found that intense programs of strength training can 
help even weak older people double their strength, as well 
as enable them to walk faster and climb stairs more easily. 
And muscle isn’t all you gain ― strength training can help 
combat osteoarthritis, depression, and risk factors for heart 
disease and diabetes.

① 근력 운동의 효과는 단기간에 얻기 힘들다.
② 근력 운동에 필요한 기초 체력을 길러야 한다.

④ 운동량은 연령에 따라 적절히 조절해야 한다.
⑤ 근력 운동은 나이가 들어서도 건강에 유익하다. 

40. Standard English allows access to certain educational 
and economic opportunities, which is the primary reason 
for teaching it. Students realize this when they interview 
for a first job or when they plan for post-high school 
education. So, what should teachers do when a student says, 
“I ain’t got no pencil,” or brings some other nonstandard 
dialect into the classroom? Opinions vary from ‘rejection 
and correction’ to complete acceptance. The approach 
most consistent with culturally responsive teaching is to 
first accept the dialect and then build on it. For example, 
when the student says, “I ain’t got no pencil,” the teacher 
might say, “Oh, you don’t have a pencil. What should you 
do, then?” Although results won’t be apparent immediately, 
the long-range benefits ― both for language development 
and attitudes toward school ― are worthwhile.  
① 표준어 사용의 경제적 측면을 고려해야 한다.
② 비표준어 사용을 수용하면서 표준어를 교육해야 한다.
③ 단기 효과를 얻을 수 있는 교수 학습법을 개발해야 한다.
④ 면접에서 표준어를 사용하도록 취업 교육을 강화해야 한다.
⑤ 비문법적 표현이 고착되지 않도록 지체 없이 교정해야 한다.

41. Emotional eaters manifest their problem in lots of 
different ways. For many people, one of the classic signs 
of emotional eating is night eating. Night eaters are often 
eating in response to anxiety or to the emotional turmoil 
they’ve experienced throughout the day. Boredom and 
loneliness are also more likely to come to the surface 
when the rush of the day is done and the night stretches 
ahead. Sometimes emotional eating is a reaction to a 
specific situation. You had a bad day at work. The kids 
have been so demanding that you are completely worn 
out. You and your significant other are fighting. It 
doesn’t matter what the circumstances are; the end result 
is that 99 times out of 100 you end up on the couch 
with a bowl of chips or bag of cookies in your hand, 
telling yourself it’s the only way you can relax.

42. Giving people the latitude and flexibility to use their 
judgment and apply their talents rapidly accelerates 
progress. Send a message of respect and inspire people to 
be creative and use their individual talents toward the 
goals of the enterprise. Empower people by letting them 
know that you believe in them and allowing them to take 
action. Trusting people and empowering them also allows 
you to focus on the things you need to accomplish. Ellyn 
McColgan says, “I used to say to people all the time, ‘I 
can help you figure out just about any problem you 
throw at me, but is that really what you want from me?’ 
They would look at me funny and say, ‘Not really.’ I 
would say, ‘I think what you would like is to do a great 
job and then give me an opportunity to say, ‘Great job!’’ 
Then they would respond, ‘Yes, that’s true.’”

(A) It’s because television focuses on news that makes the 
world seem like a more dangerous place than it actually 
is. Afraid of the world that is portrayed on TV, people 
stay in their homes with close family and do not build 
bonds with their neighbors.
(B) These are legitimate concerns that many people share. 
We live in difficult and uncertain times. But are these 
fears real? Research shows that people who watch a lot 
of news on television overestimate the threats to their 
well-being. Why?
(C) Thus they become more vulnerable. Surrounding ourselves 
with a wall of fear, however, is not the answer. The 
only way to overcome this problem is to be more 
connected to others, and this connection will reduce fear 
and isolation.

The DNA extracted from these bits of whale skin not 
only identifies the individuals in the group, but also 
reveals their relationships to each other. 
Sperm whales travel in social groups that cooperate to 
defend and protect each other, and may even share 
suckling of calves. ( ① ) It is difficult to determine the 
membership of these groups from sightings alone, because 
of the practical difficulties of observing whale behavior, 
most of which happens underwater. ( ② ) To make 
things even more difficult, sperm whales can travel across 
entire oceans and can dive to a depth of a kilometer.   
( ③ ) Biologists who study whale behavior generally 
have to be content with hanging around in boats, waiting 
for their subjects to surface. ( ④ ) But when they do 
surface, in addition to taking photos which allow 
individual whales to be identified, biologists can zip over 
in worryingly small boats and pick up the bits of skin 
that the whales leave behind on the surface when they 
re-submerge. ( ⑤ ) This has allowed researchers to 
describe sperm whale social groups in detail.

Mediation is a process that has much in common with 
advocacy but is also crucially different. It parallels 
advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of 
negotiation, but differs in so far as mediation involves 
adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties  
rather than taking up the case of one party against 
another. At times, particularly in very complex 
situations, the processes of advocacy and mediation can 
overlap, perhaps with very problematic results, as one 
loses clarity over his or her role. It is therefore 
important, if not essential, to maintain a clear focus in 
undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure 
that the roles do not become blurred and therefore 
potentially counterproductive. For example, a mediator 
who ‘takes sides’ is likely to lose all credibility, as is 
an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position.

Although both deal with negotiation, a mediator needs

① neutrality …… avoid
② neutrality …… encourage

(A)
When I was a freshman in high school, I won second 
prize in our local newspaper’s essay contest on the theme 
of ‘future career.’ I wrote about wanting to become a 
journalist. We had to collect our prizes at the local variety 
store and, while waiting in line, a little notebook in the 
stationery department caught my eye. (a) It was a black 
and red hardcover book with the word ‘Record’ neatly 
engraved in gold on the cover. I reasoned that since I 
was going to be a journalist, I’d need a very special 
notebook in which to write. So I bought (b) it.
(B)
Then during a serious illness when I was thirty-five, I 
found the little notebook I had purchased twenty years 
earlier. From my sick bed I noticed (c) it on a nearby 
shelf. It was still blank but something told me to write 
my deepest feelings and thoughts, my pain and fear, my 
wishes and dreams, the words of my inner world. This 
was my first ‘official’ journal. And the process of 
journal-keeping through writing and drawing helped heal 
me from a mysterious illness which had defied the 
doctors and their medicines.
(C)
My life changed so much after that. I began listening 
to my own feelings and inner wisdom. The insights I 
gained through journal-keeping led me into a new career 
as an art therapist and teacher of diary writing and drawing. 
More importantly, I learned to play and enjoy life again. 
For instance, several years after recovering from my 
illness, I started skateboarding for the first time in my 
life and loved (d) it. I’m grateful to that high school girl 
that I was for having the sense to buy a little blank 
book. I used it to save my life and to help others.
(D)
But I put the notebook away and promptly forgot about 
(e) it and about becoming a journalist. Painting became 
my great love. Upon graduating from high school, I went 
to college as a fine art major and English minor. After 
becoming a professional artist, marriage followed, then 
the birth of two daughters. A career change came next 
which led to teaching underprivileged young children in 
Los Angeles. The years passed.

Since the beginning of time, the mysterious nature of 
dreaming has led people to believe that dreams were 
messages from the other world. Dreams have been regarded 
as prophetic communications which, when properly decoded, 
would enable us to foretell the future. There is, however, 
absolutely no scientific evidence for this theory. It is 
certainly true that individuals who are concerned about a 
traumatic event, such as the threat of the loss of a loved 
one who is sick, will dream about that loved one more 
than would otherwise be the case. If the dreamer then calls 
and finds that the loved one has died, it is understandable 
for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition 
of that death. But this is a mistake. It is simply a(n) 
correspondence between a situation about 
which one has intense concern and the occurrence of the 
event that one fears.
To prove the existence of premonitory dreams, scientific 
evidence must be obtained. We would need to do studies 
in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream 
life and judges are asked to make correspondences between 
these dream events and events that occurred in real life. A 
problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in 
premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples 
of ‘hits,’ but they never tell you how many of their 
premonitory dreams ‘missed.’ To do a scientific study of 
dream prophecy, we would need to establish some base of 
how commonly  correspondences occur between 
dream and waking reality. Until we have that evidence, 
it is better to believe that the assumption is false.
