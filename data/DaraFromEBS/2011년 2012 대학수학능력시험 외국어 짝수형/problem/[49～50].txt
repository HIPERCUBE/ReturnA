Since the beginning of time, the mysterious nature of 
dreaming has led people to believe that dreams were 
messages from the other world. Dreams have been regarded 
as prophetic communications which, when properly decoded, 
would enable us to foretell the future. There is, however, 
absolutely no scientific evidence for this theory. It is 
certainly true that individuals who are concerned about a 
traumatic event, such as the threat of the loss of a loved 
one who is sick, will dream about that loved one more 
than would otherwise be the case. If the dreamer then calls 
and finds that the loved one has died, it is understandable 
for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition 
of that death. But this is a mistake. It is simply a(n) 
correspondence between a situation about 
which one has intense concern and the occurrence of the 
event that one fears.
To prove the existence of premonitory dreams, scientific 
evidence must be obtained. We would need to do studies 
in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream 
life and judges are asked to make correspondences between 
these dream events and events that occurred in real life. A 
problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in 
premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples 
of ‘hits,’ but they never tell you how many of their 
premonitory dreams ‘missed.’ To do a scientific study of 
dream prophecy, we would need to establish some base of 
how commonly  correspondences occur between 
dream and waking reality. Until we have that evidence, 
it is better to believe that the assumption is false.
