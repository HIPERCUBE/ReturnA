39. The good news is that it’s never too late to start building 
up muscle strength, regardless of your age. Ideally, though, 
it’s best to start in your mid-forties when muscle mass 
starts to decline significantly. “Once you’ve started, it can 
take just six weeks to see an improvement of up to 20 
percent in your muscle capabilities,” says Dr. Ward. Studies 
have found that intense programs of strength training can 
help even weak older people double their strength, as well 
as enable them to walk faster and climb stairs more easily.

combat osteoarthritis, depression, and risk factors for heart 
disease and diabetes.
