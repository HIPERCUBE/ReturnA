One day in February 2009, Stephanie called Betty, 
① her best friend, who was the only employee of her 
business Best Wedding. Once again, they discussed the 
company’s expenses and dwindling revenue. But this time, 
Stephanie knew what she had to do. She gathered up her 
courage and told ② her friend and colleague: “I have to 
make this work. I have to let ③ you go.” Betty was hurt 
but wasn’t particularly surprised. In a businesslike fashion, 
the two women began figuring out how to disengage. 
Betty said she wanted to start her own event-planning 
business, and Stephanie agreed to let ④ her keep her 
existing clients, some photography, and documents and 
forms they had developed together. ⑤ She also gave Betty 
two months’ salary as severance pay.
