Good job. The photograph of the waterfall came out nice.
I’m sorry. I didn’t know I wasn’t allowed to do that.

This is used in product manufacturing. This is designed
by determining the sequences of operations for the
manufacturing of each product component as well as the
final product. Work assignments, the number of machines,
and production rates are coordinated so that all operations
performed along this work successfully together. All
movement of product parts on this is simplified, with no
crossing over, backtracking, or repetition. This is increasingly
being handled by computers, which monitor information
and adjust the flow of parts accordingly. This usually
consists of conveyor belts on which workers perform specific
functions. Nowadays, automatic machinery and industrial
robots are taking the place of human workers on this.

For a year Danny had trained hard to master the famous
Pikes Peak Marathon. But when running the actual marathon,
he was feeling weary and tired. In a narrow path through
the woods, he got stuck behind a slow, weak runner wearing
a T-shirt with ‘Bob’s #4’ written on the back. He felt
even more tired because he had to lag behind the fellow.
As he was finally overtaking the runner, out of curiosity,
he asked him, “What’s Bob’s #4?” “My friend Bob had
a dream to run this marathon four times,” he answered.
“ He ran it three times, but then last year he died. So I
decided to complete his dream for him. This is Bob’s #4.”
Suddenly, all the exhaustion he had been feeling during
the race disappeared.
We are addicted to our cars. We do not think twice
before driving to pick something up at a store that is
only three blocks away. In fact, we romanticize driving
with our thoughts of long Sunday drives and adventurous
cross-country road trips. Well, we need to get rid of this
addiction and fast because driving is harmful to our
health and to our planet’s health. The air pollutants that
spit out from the car exhaust pipes have been proven to
cause cancer, and the carbon dioxide that is emitted causes
global warming. One of the easiest ways to reduce these
emissions is simply to change our mind-set about driving.
We need to make driving our last choice of transportation
to live a happy, healthy life. And the first step in
achieving this new mind-set is to reorganize our lives so
we do not need to drive much or far.

Almost every day I play a game with myself that I
call ‘time machine.’ I made it up in response to my
erroneous belief that what I was all worked up about was
really important. To play ‘time machine’ all you have to
do is to imagine that whatever circumstance you are
dealing with is not happening right now but a year from
now. It might be an argument with your spouse, a mistake,
or a lost opportunity, but it is highly likely that a year
from now you are not going to care. It will be one more
irrelevant detail in your life. While this simple game will
not solve every your problems, it can give you an enormous
amount of needed perspective. I find myself laughing at
things that I used to take far too seriously.
There are some areas of mathematics where long,
unpleasant but basically routine calculations have to be done,
and there are some good computer programs for doing them.
Thus, computers can be very useful time-saving devices,
sometimes so much so that they enable mathematicians to
discover results that they could not have discovered on
their own. Nevertheless, the kind of help that computers
can provide is very limited. One point that deserves to be
made is that the lack of women in mathematics is another
statistical phenomenon. If it happens that your problem,
or more usually sub-problem, is one of the small minority
that can be solved by a long and repetitive search, then
well and good. If, on the other hand, you are stuck and
need a bright idea, then, in the present state of technology,
a computer will be no help whatsoever.

Furniture is among the oldest engineering structures
designed to carry a rather well-defined load under rather
well-defined circumstances. We are not surprised that
furniture used beyond its intended purpose is broken, and
we readily blame the child who abuses the furniture rather
than the designer of the furniture or the furniture itself
when it is abused. Thus a chair must support a person in a
sitting position, but it might not be expected to survive a fall
from a tall building. A child’s bed might be expected to
support a sleeping child, but it would not necessarily be
considered badly designed if it collapsed under the child’s
wild use of it as a trampoline. The arms and legs of chairs,
the heads and feet of beds, just like those of the people
whom they serve, cannot be expected to be ___________

A vendor in a city set up shop and sold doughnuts
and coffee to passersby. During the breakfast and lunch
hours, he always had long lines of customers waiting. He
noticed that, as he was a one-man show, the biggest
bottleneck preventing him from selling more doughnuts
and coffee was the disproportionate amount of time it
took to make change for his customers. Finally, he
simply put a small basket on the side of his stand filled
with dollar bills and coins. Most customers responded by
being completely honest, often leaving him larger-than-normal
tips. Also, he was able to move customers through at
twice the pace because he did not have to make change.
In addition, he found that his customers liked this idea
and kept coming back. By _______________ in this way,
he was able to double his sales.

the wonderful truth is this: If you can accept NO for an

The spread of prosperity, the single-family home,
the invention of television and computers have all made
it possible for us to live private lives unimaginable
to previous generations. We no longer live in close
quarters with our neighbors, we can move about without
crowding into buses or trains; we do not have to go to
theaters or share our tastes with our neighbors. However,
the same technologies that help separate us from the
crowds also make it possible to monitor and record our
behaviors. Although fewer people have intimate
knowledge of our lives, many people mostly unknown
to us know something about us. The very technology
that was supposed to free us from mass society has
turned out to be as much a fishbowl as an information
highway. In modern society, we have discovered that

The three pictures above represent a model of the effects of
global warming on permafrost regions. Permafrost is frozen
ground that remains at or below 0℃ for more than two
years. Most of the world’s permafrost has been frozen for
millennia, trapping massive amounts of carbon in organic
material. In areas of extreme cold presented in Picture 1,
permafrost is thousands of feet thick and lies below a
layer of soil a few feet deep called the active layer, which
freezes and thaws with the seasons. Where the average
annual air temperature is slightly below freezing, permafrost
is scattered as in Picture 2. Compared to Picture 1, the
permafrost in Picture 2 is topped by a shallower active
layer. In Picture 3, in permafrost regions that now
experience shorter, milder winters, the area of permafrost is
reduced further, compared to Picture 2. Carbon dioxide
and methane are freed into the atmosphere and more
trees and plants grow as in Picture 3.

My mother gave me some strawberry jam to take to
Mrs. Sampson. It was winter and, when she opened the
door, I was overcome by the smell of the stove and the
damp, dark atmosphere. I was afraid of Mrs. Sampson. She
was a big woman with gray skin, like clay, with a couple
of gray hairs sticking out of her chin. She always wore a
dirty, mud-colored cardigan over shapeless dresses. Worst
of all, she had bad breath! “Here you are, dear,” she said
in her scratchy voice, and put a dollar bill in my hand,
“but don’t spend it all at once!” I fled, back to the relative
safety of my own home.

American culture in general appears suspicious of leisure.
Some people believe this may be due to the Protestant

Growing native plants in a garden is catching on like
wildfire. Natives often attract more birds and pollinators
such as bees and butterflies, increasing their diversity to
your garden. Imitating a native landscape in an isolated
urban yard, however, does not do all that much to make
up for lost native habitat. So what is the most ecological
use of your garden? At the top of the list is gardening for
your own food. There is no reason that what you plant for
birds, butterflies, and bees cannot also feed you and your
family. Sunflowers are often called ‘nature’s bird feeders,’
but you can plant enough to share the oil-rich seeds. Many
fruit trees in your garden can also feed both birds and you.

Conditioning occurs indirectly, which adds to its impact
on us. Let’s say, for example, that you watch another person
get an electric shock. Each time, a signal light comes on
before the shock is delivered. Even if you do not receive
a shock yourself, you will soon develop an emotional
response to the light. Children who learn to fear thunder by
watching their parents react to it have undergone similar
conditioning. If horror movies can affect us, we might
expect the emotions of parents, friends, and relatives to
have even more impact. How, for instance, does a city
child learn to fear snakes and respond emotionally to mere
pictures of them? Being told that “snakes are dangerous”
may not explain the child’s emotional response. More
likely, the child has observed others reacting fearfully to

the barrier at the River Scheldt
?
The barrier at the River Scheldt in the Netherlands is
the world’s largest tidal surge barrier. It protects Zeeland
from the constant threat of flooding. Completed in 1987,
it forms part of the Delta Project, a line of massive
sea-defenses, which was constructed after disastrous floods
in 1953. As originally planned, the barrier was to be a
solid dam that, by drastically restricting tidal flows,
would have destroyed much of the marine environment
on the Eastern Scheldt. In 1973, however, a campaign
forced the project to be suspended. The project was
revived four years later in a new and greatly modified
form. Instead of being permanently sealed, the redesigned
barrier is now normally open to the tides, restricting their
flow by only 25 percent. It is only when water levels
reach 3 meters above normal that steel gates close shut,
holding back even the most extreme waters.

precocial birds
The young of precocial birds belonging to the same
clutch have a strong incentive to hatch as close together
in time as possible. The mother and the first-hatched
young will be on the move within hours; chicks left
behind in the eggs will die. When the eggs of these
species are incubated separately, the hatching times are
spread over a period of days; but when they are kept
together, hatching times are close by, within one or two
hours. This coordinated hatching is achieved by sound
signals exchanged by the chicks while they are still in
the eggs. The most characteristic sound is a regular loud
click, which is most persistent just prior to hatching. It is
not caused by a tapping against the shell, but is a
vocalization associated with breathing movements.

We know where we are headed and what we want to do.
However, quite often, due to forces outside our control, things
do not go as we had planned and we have to adjust to
a postponement or create a whole new set of circumstances.
This is what happens when life throws us a curveball. The
fact is that life is unpredictable. For example, your car
breaks down and you are late for an appointment. While it
is true that you never arrive at that important meeting, you
end up spending a few relaxing hours with people you
would never have met otherwise. Remember that not only
are curveballs the universe’s way of keeping us awake
which is a gift in and of itself but they are also its
method of bringing us wonderful surprises.
When my son was seven years old, we went to a dolphin
show. After the show, I went up to the trainer and asked,
“How did you get the dolphin to do all these really neat
things?” The trainer looked at my son and me and said,
“Unlike many parents, whenever the dolphin does anything
like what I want him to do, I notice him! I give him a hug
and a fish.” The light went on in my head. Whenever my
son did what I wanted him to do, I paid little attention to
him. However, when he did not, I gave him a lot of
attention because I did not want to raise a bad kid! I was
unintentionally teaching him to be a little monster in order
to get my attention. Since that day, I have tried hard to
notice my son’s good acts and downplay his mistakes.
A man was diagnosed with a terminal illness and

The person who wrote of a building bringing gladness
to the viewer reminds us of the importance of beauty in
human life. Biologists account for the human desire for art
in other terms. They explain that human beings have very
large brains that demand stimulation. Curious, active, and
inventive, we humans constantly explore, and in so doing
invent things that appeal to our senses fine arts, fine food,
fine scents, and fine music. Art has mostly been considered
in terms of seeking beauty, but there are other reasons
deeply rooted in the human experience that create needs for
art. For one, humans also reflect on the nature of things
and the meaning of life. Visually and verbally, we
constantly communicate with each other; in our need to
understand and our need to communicate, the arts serve a
vital function.

It is possible to observe a basic and sometimes
unexplainable division in the animal world. Some species
crowd together and require physical contact with each
other. Others avoid touching. No apparent logic governs
the category into which a species falls. Curiously enough,
closely related animals may belong to different categories.
The great Emperor penguin is a contact species. It
conserves heat through contact with its fellows in large
groups. The smaller Adelie penguin is a non-contact
species. Thus it is somewhat less adaptable to cold than
the Emperor. Other functions served by contact behavior
are unknown. One could guess that, since contact animals
are more ‘involved’ with each other, their social organization
and possibly their manner of exploiting the environment
might be different from those of non-contact animals.

But the strong pig can race to the dispenser and push
the weak pig aside to claim the leftovers.
Consider the following experiment with a strong and a
weak pig. Two pigs are kept in a box with a lever at one
end and a food dispenser at the other. When the lever is
pushed, food appears at the dispenser. ( ) If the weak
pig pushes the lever, the strong pig waits by the dispenser
and eats all the food. ( ) Even if the weak pig races to
the dispenser before the food is gone, the strong pig
pushes the weak pig away. ( ) The weak pig realizes
this, so it never pushes the lever first. ( ) On the other
hand, if the strong pig pushes the lever, the weak pig
waits by the dispenser and eats most of the food. ( )
This makes it worthwhile for the strong pig to push the
lever. The outcome is that the strong pig does all the work
and the weak pig does most of the eating.

The face of the water, in time, became a wonderful
book a book that was a dead language to the
uneducated passenger, but which told its mind to the
pilot without reserve, delivering its most cherished
secrets as clearly as if it spoke them with a voice. The
passenger who could not read this book saw nothing
but all manner of pretty pictures in it, painted by the
sun and shaded by the clouds. To the pilot, however, it
was a highlighted passage. Indeed, it was more than
that; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried
there that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel
that ever floated. It is the faintest and simplest

As we explore together the virtual world that floats
on the edge of this material life, the many imaginative
territories you inhabit bring back another reality. I catch
images of my own childhood wanderings through
Narnia, the land of hobbits, and Mowgli’s jungle. All
these are deep pleasures which combine all my senses
and momentarily transport me into another dimension of
living.
If I were to bring it all together I would say that
among all the misery, fear, injustice, and pain, I hope
you will not forget moments when all this fades away
into periods of innocent joy. It is when we bring all
our powerful senses together, perhaps in a moment in
the garden of earthly delights that we over
despair.
So the moment when you dance to Handel or when
you sit in a pool of wild flowers, or gravely take part
in your first tea ceremony, these are the moments you
will treasure. They are, with similar moments with
friends and loved ones, what makes being human
bearable.

When I first began teaching, I was invited to a
workshop for new professors. Like most people who
teach at universities, I had spent a long time learning
what to teach, but none learning how to teach it.
Somehow, my university seemed to hope, a weekend
spent with experienced professors would make up for
that. My colleagues presented well-crafted lectures about
the tools they used in the classroom. I enjoyed their
presentations, but do not remember a thing they said.

When we were called to the next talk, he put down his
cup and I noticed there was not a trace of coffee in it.
I thought that was rather odd, and said so. “My doctor
told me to stop drinking coffee,” he explained. “So I
have always used an empty cup. Doesn’t make any
difference.” I decided to try his idea in my class, but not
with an empty cup.

(C)
I took a cup of coffee with me to my next class
Monday morning. It helped. My pauses, as I drank the
coffee, not only gave my students time to think about
what I had said, but gave me time to think about what
I was going to say next. I began to use my pauses to
look around the room to see how my students were
reacting to what I had just said. When I saw their
attention wander, I tried to bring them back. When I
saw them puzzled over some concept that I thought I
had explained, I gave another example. My lectures
became less organized and less brilliant, but my
students seemed to understand me better.
(D)
One thing that I do remember happened at a coffee
break. Finding myself alone, I turned to a mathematics
professor standing nearby. I asked him what his favorite
teaching tool was. “A cup of coffee,” he said. I asked
him how he used it. “Well,” he said, “I talk too much
and too fast in the classroom. Students sometimes have
trouble following me. So every once in a while, when
I’ve said something I want my students to think about, I
stop and take a sip of coffee. It lets what I’ve just said
sink in.”
