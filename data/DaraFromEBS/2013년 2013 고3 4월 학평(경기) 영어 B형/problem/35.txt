35. If you stand still in vertical rain, you will only get wet on top
of your head, but once you start to move, your front starts
getting wet as well. But, crucially, !
Think about it this way: in every volume of space, there is a
certain density of raindrops. Your front will meet that density
of drops when you get to it no matter what your speed, so
going more slowly does not help. It turns out that real-world
effects do give runners a small increase in dampness―maybe
the air currents caused by running suck in more rain than they
repel, or heavier footsteps cause more splashing― but that is a
drop in the bucket, so to speak, compared to the wetness you
will prevent by getting to shelter quicker. [3점]
① there is no way for you to get to shelter
② you have to consider the direction of the wind
③ the density of raindrops affects walking speed
④ you don’t hit fewer raindrops by moving slower
⑤ wetness will be prevented by careful footsteps
