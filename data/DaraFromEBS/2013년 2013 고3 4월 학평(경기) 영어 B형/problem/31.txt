31. Imagine that you are lying on a bed in a dental clinic. If you
were told “only two times more” versus “only ten times more,”
wouldn’t you use different mental strategies to try to cope?
With either scenario, you would pull out the comforting thought
of “only one more and then it’s the last one” at different times;
you would save your most distracting fantasy for a different
point. information lets us know what internal
coping strategy is likely to work best during a stressor. A
simple example: you have some minor surgery. You are told
that on the first post-surgical day there is going to be a lot of
pain, whereas by the second day, you will just feel a bit achy.
Armed with that information, you are more likely to plan on
watching distracting videos on the first day and to devote day
two to writing poems.
