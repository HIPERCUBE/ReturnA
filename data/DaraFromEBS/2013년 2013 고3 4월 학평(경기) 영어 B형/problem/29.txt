The graph above shows the top five categories of U.S.
consumer electronics sales and their share of total revenue in
2010 and 2011. ① PCs accounted for approximately 20 percent
of total revenue, topping the share of total revenue both in
2010 and 2011. ② Video game hardware, however, represented
the lowest percentage of revenue among the top five categories
in 2011, though it had the third highest in the previous year. ③
One noticeable category, which saw the biggest increase in
share of revenue, was tablets/e-readers, with its share more
than doubling between 2010 and 2011. ④Along with
tablets/e-readers, mobile phones also gained an increased
share in 2011, whereas the other three categories showed a
decreased share. ⑤TVs ranked the second highest in share of
revenue in 2010, and did the same in 2011 with only a small
decrease of 1.2%.
