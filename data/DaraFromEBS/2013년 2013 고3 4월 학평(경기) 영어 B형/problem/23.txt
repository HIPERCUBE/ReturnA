So many problems can be avoided by slowing down and
carefully considering how to proceed in any given situation. In
some instances, of course, there isn’t time to slow down and
we have to just react. But generally we have more time than
we allot ourselves to make decisions and draw conclusions.
Slowing down provides time to consider how an issue has been
framed and whether we have really considered all the relevant
factors. We ought to pause for a moment in order to reconsider
actions that could have serious consequences. Putting on the
mental brakes can stop you, for example, from reacting in anger
to someone on the road ―a situation that can lead to danger. If
more of us would take just a couple extra moments to think an
action through, we would all be much better off.
