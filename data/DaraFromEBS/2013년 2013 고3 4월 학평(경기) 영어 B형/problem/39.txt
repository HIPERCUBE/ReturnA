Regrettably, this is not the case― not even for the fastest
sprinters in the world.
For most athletes, maximum speed is reached between
40-60m. Once this is achieved, the challenge is to hold this
speed for as long as possible. ( ① ) Young athletes may run
with the belief that they will run faster and faster until they
reach the finishing line. ( ② ) After 60m, all sprinters start to
slow down. ( ③ ) At both maximum speed and decelerating
speed, the challenge for the runner is to maintain their
technique as long as possible. ( ④ ) Vigorous arm actions,
powerful extensions of the rear leg, and applying sprinting
forces through the ball of the foot will all help to hold the speed
as long as possible. ( ⑤ ) Some people observe that great
sprinters start to pull away from other runners toward the
finishing line― this is because these athletes are not slowing
down as fast as their opponents.
