In the case of a company, it is common to describe culture
as the visible elements of a working environment: casual
Fridays or free sodas in the cafeteria. But as MIT’s Edgar
Schein explains, those things don’t define a culture. They are
just artifacts of it. According to him, culture is a way of
working together toward common goals that people have
followed so frequently and so successfully that they don’t
even think about trying to do things another way. If a culture
has formed, people will autonomously do what they need to
do to be successful.
Those instincts are not formed overnight. Rather, they are
the result of shared learning. In every organization, there is
that first time when a problem or challenge arises. Those
responsible reach a decision together on what to do and how
to do it in order to succeed. If that decision results in a
successful outcome, then the next time when those
employees face a similar type of challenge, they will return
to the same decision and same way of solving the problem.
As long as the way they have chosen keeps working to
solve the problem, the culture will become an internal set of
rules that people will draw upon in making the choices ahead
of them. They will just assume that the way they have been
doing it is the way of doing it. This causes an organization to
become . Managers don’t need to enforce the
rule. People instinctively get on with what needs to be done.
