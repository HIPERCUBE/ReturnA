Early one night in 1973 in my old and cheap apartment 
in Bangor, Maine, I got a phone call from my agent, Bill, 
who was helping me publish my first novel. “Are you 
sitting down?” Bill asked. “No,” I said. “Do I need to?” 
“You might,” he said. “The publication rights for your 
book were sold for four hundred thousand dollars!” I was 
completely speechless. That amount of money was beyond 
my wildest expectations. I was sure I hadn’t heard him 
right. I couldn’t have. I asked, “Did you say it went for 
forty thousand dollars?” Bill said it again as clearly as he 
could, “Four hundred thousand dollars. Congratulations, 
Steve.” “Are you sure, Bill?” I said in disbelief. He said he 
was. We talked for another half an hour, but I don’t 
remember a single word of what we said.
