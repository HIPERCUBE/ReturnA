In the twentieth century, advances in technology, from 
refrigeration to sophisticated ovens to air transportation 
① that carries fresh ingredients around the world, contributed 
immeasurably to baking and pastry making. At the beginning

became more industrialized and baked goods became more 
refined, standardized, and― some would say― flavorless.

sourdough breads of the past, and they are experimenting 
with specialty flours in their search for flavor.
