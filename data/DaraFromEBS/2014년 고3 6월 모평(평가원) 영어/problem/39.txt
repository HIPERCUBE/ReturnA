But no one, even your child, is exactly like you.
Parents often believe that they are providing help to their 
children when they constantly correct and criticize them, 
assuming that they will grow from these remarks. But ask 
yourself: Do you like being corrected? Do you grow when 
you are constantly criticized? ( ① ) In truth, we tend to 
stay the same when we are criticized. ( ② ) We want to 
defend what we have done, and our innate stubbornness 
refuses to permit us to accept the criticism we are receiving. 
( ③ ) Behind virtually all criticism is the sentence “If only 
you were more like me, and living life as I see it, you 
would be a lot better off.” ( ④ ) Praise your children for 
attempting a task, even if it was unsuccessful, and for 
taking risks. ( ⑤ ) Create an environment in which your 
children know that you are with them in their efforts, rather 
than looking to criticize them.
