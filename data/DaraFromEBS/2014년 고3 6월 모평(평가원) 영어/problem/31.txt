31. The origins of contemporary Western thought can be 
traced back to the golden age of ancient Greece, when Greek 
thinkers laid the foundations for modern Western politics, 
philosophy, science, and law. Their novel approach was to 
pursue rational inquiry through adversarial discussion: The 
best way to evaluate one set of ideas, they decided, was 
by . In the 
political sphere, the result was democracy, in which 
supporters of rival policies vied for rhetorical supremacy; in 
philosophy, it led to reasoned arguments and dialogues about 
the nature of the world; in science, it prompted the 
construction of competing theories to try to explain natural 
phenomena; in the field of law, the result was the adversarial 
legal system. This approach is the foundation for the modern 
Western way of life, in which politics, commerce, science, and 
law are all rooted in orderly competition. [3점]
