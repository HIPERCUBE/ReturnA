30. The true champion recognizes that excellence often flows 
most smoothly from , a fact that can get lost in 
these high-tech days. I used to train with a world-class 
runner who was constantly hooking himself up to pulse 
meters and pace keepers. He spent hours collecting data that 
he thought would help him improve. In fact, a good 25 
percent of his athletic time was devoted to externals other 
than working out. Sports became so complex for him that he 
forgot how to enjoy himself. Contrast his approach with that 
of the late Abebe Bikila, the Ethiopian who won the 1960 
Olympic Marathon running barefoot. High-tech clothing and 
digital watches were not part of his world. Abebe Bikila 
simply ran. Many times in running, and in other areas of 
life, less is more. [3점]
