Dear Ms. Mattie,
Thank you very much for offering me the research 
engineer position at ABC Company. However, after 
a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept 
the position. Your company has an excellent reputation 
as a research institution and has many aspects that 
are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot 
accept your offer because I have decided to pursue 
another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your 
consideration. 
Very truly yours,
Christine Mahoe
