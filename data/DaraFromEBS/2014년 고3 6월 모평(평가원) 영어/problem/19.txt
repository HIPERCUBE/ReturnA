Obviously, one of the judgments the public has of us is 
whether or not our telephone service is good. Technically, if 
they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they 
get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. 
They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner 
that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy 
and consideration; and they are in a position to get what 
they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the 
bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and 
fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for 
a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must 
have a philosophy and a method of doing business which 
will allow and insure that its people serve the public 
efficiently and in a pleasing manner.
