Dave Butcher, director of training for Sea World in 
Florida, showed me more than I’d imagined possible. His sea 
lions worked for social rewards as well as fish. Consequently, 
he did not have to keep his sea lions hungry in order to make 
① them perform. During and after the day’s performances, 
the sea lions could have all the fish ② they wanted. One result 
was that ③ they were not irritable, as any hungry animal 
might be. The sea lions were friendly to those humans they 
knew and enjoyed being with ④ them. I was surprised to see 
trainers on their lunch hour sunbathing in a pile with their 
sea lions. Another result of stopping food deprivation was 
that these sea lions grew and grew! In fact, ⑤ they became 
bigger than most trained sea lions in the past, which weren’t 
given enough food.
