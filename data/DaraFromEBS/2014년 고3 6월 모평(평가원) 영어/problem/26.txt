During her childhood years, the artist Tammy Rahr spent 
a lot of time outdoors making things from flowers and dirt. 
Then Tammy and her family moved from the woodlands of 
New York State to an urban city outside of Los Angeles, 
California. The experience made her more aware of what was 
going on in the world. After returning to New York State 
with her family, Tammy faced another lesson in growing up. 
A gifted student, she was sent to college when she was just 
14. Tammy was able to earn her high school diploma and 
some college credit before trying her hand at a number of 
different jobs. Eventually, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, 
and studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts. After 
graduating from the institute, she remained active with it and 
the museum there.
