35. Music can convey the scope of a film, effectively 
communicating whether the motion picture is an epic drama 
or a story that exists on a more personal scale. Music can 
convey the quality and size of a space. ① For example, in 
Alien and Olivier’s Hamlet, the music serves at times to make 
small and/or artificial spaces seem more grand and to 
enhance the sense of realism. ② In addition, music can 
establish a narrative’s placement in time. ③Music for motion 
pictures often serves to authenticate the era or to provide a 
sense of nostalgia. ④Music has traditionally been classified 
by musical instruments. ⑤ Examples of the former would 
include Amadeus and Immortal Beloved, while a sense of 
nostalgia is communicated through the music selected for 
films such as American Graffiti and The Big Chill.
