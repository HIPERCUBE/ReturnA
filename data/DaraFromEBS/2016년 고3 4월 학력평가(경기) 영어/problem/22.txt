Work was once seen as human penance for evil beginnings in 
the Garden of Eden. Over the years, as socioeconomic classes 
arose in society in the Middle Ages, work began to be seen as 
the curse of the poor. The wealthy in society did all they could 
to avoid labor, perhaps except for war, which was seen as 
noble. Eventually enlightened philosophers such as St. Thomas 
Aquinas and his contemporaries taught that work was 
important, especially if we used our surplus to help others. 
Their teachings influenced reformers such as Martin Luther, 
who explained that work was virtuous if we had integrity and 
were honest in our dealings with our fellow men. Later, as 
America and Canada expanded into new territories, work in 
contemporary society was described as a privilege of the free. 
Then, as we entered the 1900s, Henry Ford and other 
industrialists convinced us that work led to progress for our 
society and our families.
