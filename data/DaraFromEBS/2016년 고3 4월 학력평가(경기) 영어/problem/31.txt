31. If we can’t have everything we want today, what do we do? 
We are forced to make choices. We must choose some goods 
and services and not others. Sometimes this kind of choosing 
can be visibly painful. Have you ever watched children in a toy 
store with a gift certificate in hand? It can take them all day 
before they make a choice. And instead of bubbling with 
excitement over the toy they bought, they usually appear 
frustrated over not being able to walk away with everything!

have everything all at once, we are forever forced to make 
choices. We can use our resources to satisfy only some of our 
wants, leaving many others unsatisfied. [3점]
