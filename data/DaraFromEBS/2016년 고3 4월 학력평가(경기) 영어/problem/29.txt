With a power gap, the more hierarchical your culture or 
background, the greater the power gap is apt to be. This is 
because hierarchical cultures (A) decrease / reinforce the 
differences between managers and employees. If you tend to 
be more hierarchical in your orientation, you tend to put 
those in positions of authority at a higher level, and there is 
more respect for that status or position, divorced even from 
the person who occupies it. (B) Distance / Friendliness is 
seen as good if you have a hierarchical preference. It 
wouldn’t be proper for a manager to be too familiar with his 
employees. The effect is that any power gap that exists is 
magnified through the lens of this dimension. A greater 
power gap can result in decreased communication as well as 
increased misunderstandings and conflict, potentially leading 
to (C) missed / unlimited opportunities for building significant 
business and career relationships.
