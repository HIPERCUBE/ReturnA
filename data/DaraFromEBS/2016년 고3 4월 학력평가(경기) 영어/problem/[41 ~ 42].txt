The overabundance of available storage capacity makes it 
easy for us to shift our behavioral default regarding external 
memory from forgetting to remembering. We save different 
versions of the documents we are working on to our hard disks. 
And we store images and music files, on the assumption that 
perhaps some day we might need them. Storing information has 
become fantastically convenient, but it’s more than convenience 
that makes us preserve. The truth is that the economics of 
storage have made forgetting brutally expensive. Consider 
digital cameras: When you connect your camera to your 
computer to upload the images you took onto your hard disk, 
you are usually given a choice. You can either select which 
images to upload, or have your computer copy automatically all 
images from your camera. Reassured perhaps by the soothing 
idea that one can always go through them later and delete the 
images one does not like, invariably most people choose the 
latter option. Economically speaking, this makes sense. 
Assuming it takes only three seconds for a person to look at an 
image and decide whether to preserve it or not, and that she 
values her own time at a current average wage, the “cost” of 
the time alone that it takes to decide  the cost of 
storage. With such an abundance of cheap storage, it is simply 
no longer economical to even decide whether to remember or 
forget. Forgetting ― the three seconds it takes to choose ― has 
become too expensive for people to use.
