Adolescence is a stage of development in which teens have 
superb cognitive abilities and high rates of learning and 
memory because they are still riding on the heightened 
synaptic plasticity of childhood. 
(A) This means a little bit of stimulation to a teenage brain 
whose synapses are firing all over the place leads to 
wanting more stimulation that can, in certain situations, 
result in a kind of overlearning. The more commonly 
known name for this overlearning is addiction. 
(B) These abilities give them a distinct advantage over adults, 
but because they are so primed to learn, they are also 
extremely vulnerable to learning the wrong things. How 
does this happen?
(C) It is all because the brain wants rewards and anything that 
is learned, good or bad, that stimulates the production of 
dopamine is interpreted by the brain as a reward.
