25. North Yungas Road에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
North Yungas Road, known as ‘Death Road,’ connects the 
Yungas region of northern Bolivia to the capital, La Paz. The 
road was built in the 1930s during the Chaco War by 
Paraguayan prisoners of war. Starting from La Paz, this road 
first climbs to 4,650 meters, and then gradually descends to 
1,200 meters at the town of Coroico. This drop is one of the 
longest stretches of continuous downhill road in the world. It’s 
mostly a single-lane road with no guard rails, and it has cliffs 
of up to 600 meters. The hazards include landslides and 
tumbling rocks, constant fog, tropical downpours and limited 
visibility. Unlike the rest of Bolivia, one of the local road rules 
specifies that vehicles are required to drive on the left side of 
the road to give the driver a better view of the vehicle’s 
outside wheel and make passing safer.
