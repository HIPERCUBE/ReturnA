Like cross-training, cross-eating adds needed variety to 
your life ― in this case, nutritional variety. Existing on a few 
dietary staples like bagels, bananas, and energy bars may leave 
you short on the fiber, vitamins, and minerals that are crucial 
for health. You should expand your nutrient repertoire. You can 
do this by trying a new food each week, or by getting in the 
habit of sampling new grains or pasta dishes at your local 
grocery store. Go for more variety at each meal by, for 
example, including two steamed vegetables and two grain foods 
(like rice and whole-grain bread) instead of a single source of 
each. Having more foods at each meal will also help control 
portion sizes, which may keep you from overloading on fat or 
sodium from one particular food.
