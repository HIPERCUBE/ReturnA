Becoming indispensable can be as much about how you work as 
what you produce. Many employees believe they will receive the 
recognition they desire by attacking their work with a singular 
vision. They are driven with laser-beam focus, believing this 
will help them create optimal results that will showcase their 
talents and impress those at the top. But when you do this, 
something important is missing. A narrow focus tends to produce 
narrow results only valuable to your little corner of the company. 
The most successful employees are not those who focus solely 
on their own work. They are those who maintain a broader focus, 
keeping their tasks in line with what’s most important to the 
company and its future. Producing through the lens of the bigger 
picture will make your work seem larger than life, while work 
produced with a narrow focus is usually dismissed as “typical.”
