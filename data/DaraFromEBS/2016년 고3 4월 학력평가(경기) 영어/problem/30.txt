While working at the cash register in a shop, a young college 
student saw an elderly couple come in with their granddaughter 
in a wheelchair. The cashier looked closely at the child; ① she 
had no arms or legs. As the couple wheeled her up to the 
counter, the college student turned her head toward the girl and 
gave ② her a wink. As she took the money from the child’s 
grandparents, she looked back at the girl, who gave her a 
beaming smile. All of a sudden the child’s disability was gone 
and all the young student saw was this beautiful girl; ③ her 
smile was breathtaking and gave the college student a 
completely new sense of life. ④ She took the young cashier from 
being an unhappy college student into her world of smiles, love, 
and warmth. Several years later as a successful business person, 
the once unhappy college student remembered the remarkable 
lesson about life that the child taught ⑤ her that day.
