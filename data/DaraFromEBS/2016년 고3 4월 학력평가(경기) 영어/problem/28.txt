28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
We all want to believe that our brains sort through 
information in the most rational way ① possible. On the 
contrary, countless studies show that there are many 
weaknesses of human reasoning. Common weaknesses in 
reasoning ② exist across people of all ages and educational 
backgrounds. For example, confirmation bias is ubiquitous. 
People pay attention to information that supports their 
viewpoints, while ③ ignoring evidence to the contrary. 
Confirmation bias is not the same as being stubborn, and is not 
constrained to issues ④ about which people have strong 
opinions. Instead, it acts at a subconscious level to control the 
way we gather and filter information. Most of us are not 
aware of these types of flaws in our reasoning processes, but 
professionals who work to convince us of certain viewpoints 
⑤ to study the research on human decision making to 
determine how to exploit our weaknesses to make us more 
susceptible to their messages.
