Not until the rise of ecology at the beginning of the twentieth 
century did people begin to think seriously of land as a natural 
system with interconnecting parts. ① A century earlier, 
Thomas Jefferson had vigorously promoted an orderly division 
of the American land, beginning with the Northwest Territory. 
② Surveyors were sent forth to draw rectangular grids on the 
land, dividing the wilds into counties, townships, and ultimately 
homesteads, with little concern for terrain or other natural 
features. ③ They adopted the environmentally friendly system 
even though they did not see a profit in it. ④ That system had 
its virtues, but in time ecology made the lines appear artificial. 
⑤ As some observers would come to see it, the rectangular 
grid system caused as much harm as it did good.
