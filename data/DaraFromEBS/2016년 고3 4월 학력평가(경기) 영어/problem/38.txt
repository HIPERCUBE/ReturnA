In a different paradigm, human health and ecological survival 
would be paramount, and industrial activities that undermine 
these goals would be prohibited outright. 
Unfortunately many organizations and political leaders 
working to improve environmental and social conditions operate 
unquestioningly from within the paradigm. ( ① ) However, to 
paraphrase Einstein, problems cannot be solved from within the 
same paradigm in which they were created. ( ② ) A good 
example is the cap and trade approach to reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. ( ③ ) In this scenario, private companies are 
permitted to sell their “right” to pollute to other companies, 
which can then pollute more, in the belief that the free hand of 
the market will find the most efficient opportunities for 
greenhouse gas reductions. ( ④ ) But viewing pollution as a 
“right” and relying on the market to solve environmental 
problems reinforces the very paradigm that got us into this 
mess. ( ⑤ ) The right to clean air and a healthy climate would 
win over the right to pollute. [3점]
