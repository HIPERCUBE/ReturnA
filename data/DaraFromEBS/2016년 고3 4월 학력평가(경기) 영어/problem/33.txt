33. Our kitchens owe much to the brilliance of science, and a 
cook experimenting with mixtures at the stove is often not 
very different from a chemist in the lab: we add vinegar to red 
cabbage to fix the color and use baking soda to counteract the 
acidity of lemon in the cake. It is wrong to suppose, however, 
that . 
It is something more basic and older than this. Not every 
culture has had formal science ― a form of organized 
knowledge about the universe that starts with Aristotle in the 
fourth century BC. The modern scientific method, in which 
experiments form part of a structured system of hypothesis, 
experimentation, and analysis is as recent as the seventeenth 
century; the problem-solving technology of cooking goes back 
thousands of years. Since the earliest Stone Age humans cut 
raw food with sharpened flints, we have always used invention 
to devise better ways to feed ourselves. [3점] 
① science has nothing to do with philosophy
② a hypothesis can be proved by a single experiment
③ technology is just the appliance of scientific thought
④ cooking has always been independent from formal science
⑤ food is cooked only through the problem-solving technology
