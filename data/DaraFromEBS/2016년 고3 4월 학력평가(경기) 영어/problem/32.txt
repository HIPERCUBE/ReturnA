32. Establishing protected areas with intact ecosystems is 
essential for species conservation. It is, however, shortsighted 
to rely solely on protected areas to preserve biodiversity. Such 
reliance can create a paradoxical situation in which species and 
ecosystems inside the protected areas are preserved while the 
same species and ecosystems outside are allowed to be 
damaged, which in turn results in . 
This is due in part to the fact that many species must migrate 
across protected area boundaries to access resources that the 
protected area itself cannot provide. In India, for example, 
tigers leave their protected areas to hunt in the surrounding 
human-dominated landscape. In general, the smaller the 
protected area, the more it depends on unprotected neighboring 
lands for the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. 
Unprotected areas, including those immediately outside 
protected areas, are thus crucial to an overall conservation 
strategy. [3점]
① the decline of biodiversity within the protected areas
② the fall in migration of species to the unprotected areas
③ the increase of predators’ migration to the protected areas
④ the balance and harmony between humanity and biodiversity
