Guiding students’ progress through the math curriculum in a 
way that promotes successful, long-term learning and positive 
math attitudes requires paying attention to their different levels 
of achievable challenge and different learning strengths. 
Through this construct, students become engaged and open to 
acquiring the skills they need to progress to the next level. 
Individualized achievable challenge connects students to 
knowledge by communicating high expectations, confirming that 
they have the capacity to reach these goals, and showing them 
how to access the tools and support they need to reach goals 
they consider desirable. By engaging students and ensuring that 
they succeed frequently, we empower those who have math 
negativity by providing a sense of their growing knowledge of 
and appreciation for math.
