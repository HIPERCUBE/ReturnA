Who could deny that the human body is a miracle? Imagine: 
each of us is safely housed within a bundle of blood, bone, 
and guts nurturing a little glow of life while suspended in a 
sea of constant change and danger.
(A) In other words, traditional housing approaches were 
specific to the culture, climate, and environment. Consider 
the igloo, a building using the thermal mass of ice to 
enclose heat and resist snow, or the ancient Egyptians’ 
ventilation domes that produced interior cooling amid 
burning desert heat. 
(B) Housing, likewise, originally developed slowly within 
particular human cultures and in response to specific 
climates and environments. Each culture around the world 
crafted a unique style of housing from the fabric of their 
surroundings. 
(C) The miracle becomes even more amazing when you 
consider the long, slow, evolutionary process of give and 
take that produced the human body. Our bodies developed 
with nature, within it, as part of it, over time.
