Dear Mr. Luckman, 
A few weeks ago I bought a decorative bowl 
manufactured by your company. Although it makes a 
beautiful centerpiece for my table, I noticed on the 
enclosed information leaflet that the bowl gives off 
harmful chemicals when microwaved. I think that many 
customers are unaware of the danger of chemical 
poisoning. Knowing how dangerous chemical poisoning 
is, I think it’s important that you adequately warn 
customers not to microwave the bowl. I suggest that 
you use bold print on the outside of the box. Clarify 
that the notice of harmful chemicals is a warning, not 
just a characteristic of the clay. Please consider this so 
that unnecessary poisoning does not occur.  
Sincerely, 
Andy Rooney

19. 다음 글에 드러난 Matt Brown의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Early in his career as a pilot, Matt Brown was flying a 
twin-engine plane northeast out of Harlingen, Texas, when he 
noticed a drop in oil pressure in his right engine. He was alone, 
flying through the night at eleven thousand feet. He reduced 
altitude and kept an eye on the oil gauge, hoping to fly as far as 
a planned fuel stop in Louisiana, where he could service the 
plane, but the pressure kept falling. Matt has been messing 
around with piston engines since he was old enough to hold a 
wrench, and he knew he had a problem. If he let the oil 
pressure get too low, he risked the engine’s stopping. How 
much further could he fly before shutting it down? What would 
happen when he did? He breathed heavily and felt the dreadful 
cold sweat running down his back.
① calm and relieved ② proud and contented
③ bored and indifferent ④ nervous and horrified

Like cross-training, cross-eating adds needed variety to 
your life ― in this case, nutritional variety. Existing on a few 
dietary staples like bagels, bananas, and energy bars may leave 
you short on the fiber, vitamins, and minerals that are crucial 
for health. You should expand your nutrient repertoire. You can 
do this by trying a new food each week, or by getting in the 
habit of sampling new grains or pasta dishes at your local 
grocery store. Go for more variety at each meal by, for 
example, including two steamed vegetables and two grain foods 
(like rice and whole-grain bread) instead of a single source of 
each. Having more foods at each meal will also help control 
portion sizes, which may keep you from overloading on fat or 
sodium from one particular food.

Guiding students’ progress through the math curriculum in a 
way that promotes successful, long-term learning and positive 
math attitudes requires paying attention to their different levels 
of achievable challenge and different learning strengths. 
Through this construct, students become engaged and open to 
acquiring the skills they need to progress to the next level. 
Individualized achievable challenge connects students to 
knowledge by communicating high expectations, confirming that 
they have the capacity to reach these goals, and showing them 
how to access the tools and support they need to reach goals 
they consider desirable. By engaging students and ensuring that 
they succeed frequently, we empower those who have math 
negativity by providing a sense of their growing knowledge of 
and appreciation for math.

④ 생활 속 수학적 원리를 이용한 수업이 활성화될 필요가 있다.
22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Work was once seen as human penance for evil beginnings in 
the Garden of Eden. Over the years, as socioeconomic classes 
arose in society in the Middle Ages, work began to be seen as 
the curse of the poor. The wealthy in society did all they could 
to avoid labor, perhaps except for war, which was seen as 
noble. Eventually enlightened philosophers such as St. Thomas 
Aquinas and his contemporaries taught that work was 
important, especially if we used our surplus to help others. 
Their teachings influenced reformers such as Martin Luther, 
who explained that work was virtuous if we had integrity and 
were honest in our dealings with our fellow men. Later, as 
America and Canada expanded into new territories, work in 
contemporary society was described as a privilege of the free. 
Then, as we entered the 1900s, Henry Ford and other 
industrialists convinced us that work led to progress for our 
society and our families. 
* penance: 속죄
① various ways to improve working conditions
② changes in the perception of work over time
③ efforts to raise awareness about workers’ rights
④ influences of the working class on modern society
⑤ relationships between working hours and productivity
23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Becoming indispensable can be as much about how you work as 
what you produce. Many employees believe they will receive the 
recognition they desire by attacking their work with a singular 
vision. They are driven with laser-beam focus, believing this 
will help them create optimal results that will showcase their 
talents and impress those at the top. But when you do this, 
something important is missing. A narrow focus tends to produce 
narrow results only valuable to your little corner of the company. 
The most successful employees are not those who focus solely 
on their own work. They are those who maintain a broader focus, 
keeping their tasks in line with what’s most important to the 
company and its future. Producing through the lens of the bigger 
picture will make your work seem larger than life, while work 
produced with a narrow focus is usually dismissed as “typical.”

The two pie charts above show the change in percentage of 
five U.S. immigrant sources between 1960 and 2013. ① In 
1960, Europe/Canada was the largest source of U.S. immigrants, 
but it dropped to fourth place in 2013. ② The largest source for 
the nation’s immigrants in 2013 was Mexico. ③ The percentage 
of Mexico and Other Latin America together only accounted for 
10% in 1960, but it increased to more than 50% in 2013. ④ The 
percentage of immigrant population born in South/East Asia 
increased to 26% in 2013, which was more than seven times 
that of 1960. ⑤ Though Europe/Canada was a dominant source 
making up more than 80% of U.S. immigrants in 1960, no single 
source contributed more than 30% in 2013.
25. North Yungas Road에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
North Yungas Road, known as ‘Death Road,’ connects the 
Yungas region of northern Bolivia to the capital, La Paz. The 
road was built in the 1930s during the Chaco War by 
Paraguayan prisoners of war. Starting from La Paz, this road 
first climbs to 4,650 meters, and then gradually descends to 
1,200 meters at the town of Coroico. This drop is one of the 
longest stretches of continuous downhill road in the world. It’s 
mostly a single-lane road with no guard rails, and it has cliffs 
of up to 600 meters. The hazards include landslides and 
tumbling rocks, constant fog, tropical downpours and limited 
visibility. Unlike the rest of Bolivia, one of the local road rules 
specifies that vehicles are required to drive on the left side of 
the road to give the driver a better view of the vehicle’s 
outside wheel and make passing safer.

We all want to believe that our brains sort through 
information in the most rational way ① possible. On the 
contrary, countless studies show that there are many 
weaknesses of human reasoning. Common weaknesses in 
reasoning ② exist across people of all ages and educational 
backgrounds. For example, confirmation bias is ubiquitous. 
People pay attention to information that supports their 
viewpoints, while ③ ignoring evidence to the contrary. 
Confirmation bias is not the same as being stubborn, and is not 
constrained to issues ④ about which people have strong 
opinions. Instead, it acts at a subconscious level to control the 
way we gather and filter information. Most of us are not 
aware of these types of flaws in our reasoning processes, but 
professionals who work to convince us of certain viewpoints 
⑤ to study the research on human decision making to 
determine how to exploit our weaknesses to make us more 
susceptible to their messages.

With a power gap, the more hierarchical your culture or 
background, the greater the power gap is apt to be. This is 
because hierarchical cultures (A) decrease / reinforce the 
differences between managers and employees. If you tend to 
be more hierarchical in your orientation, you tend to put 
those in positions of authority at a higher level, and there is 
more respect for that status or position, divorced even from 
the person who occupies it. (B) Distance / Friendliness is 
seen as good if you have a hierarchical preference. It 
wouldn’t be proper for a manager to be too familiar with his 
employees. The effect is that any power gap that exists is 
magnified through the lens of this dimension. A greater 
power gap can result in decreased communication as well as 
increased misunderstandings and conflict, potentially leading 
to (C) missed / unlimited opportunities for building significant 
business and career relationships. 
(A) (B) (C)
① decrease …… Distance …… missed
② decrease …… Friendliness …… unlimited
③ reinforce …… Distance …… missed
④ reinforce …… Friendliness …… unlimited
⑤ reinforce …… Distance …… unlimited

While working at the cash register in a shop, a young college 
student saw an elderly couple come in with their granddaughter 
in a wheelchair. The cashier looked closely at the child; ① she 
had no arms or legs. As the couple wheeled her up to the 
counter, the college student turned her head toward the girl and 
gave ② her a wink. As she took the money from the child’s 
grandparents, she looked back at the girl, who gave her a 
beaming smile. All of a sudden the child’s disability was gone 
and all the young student saw was this beautiful girl; ③ her 
smile was breathtaking and gave the college student a 
completely new sense of life. ④ She took the young cashier from 
being an unhappy college student into her world of smiles, love, 
and warmth. Several years later as a successful business person, 
the once unhappy college student remembered the remarkable 
lesson about life that the child taught ⑤ her that day.

31. If we can’t have everything we want today, what do we do? 
We are forced to make choices. We must choose some goods 
and services and not others. Sometimes this kind of choosing 
can be visibly painful. Have you ever watched children in a toy 
store with a gift certificate in hand? It can take them all day 
before they make a choice. And instead of bubbling with 
excitement over the toy they bought, they usually appear 
frustrated over not being able to walk away with everything! 
Life is like that.  governs us. Because we cannot 
have everything all at once, we are forever forced to make 
choices. We can use our resources to satisfy only some of our 
wants, leaving many others unsatisfied. [3점]

32. Establishing protected areas with intact ecosystems is 
essential for species conservation. It is, however, shortsighted 
to rely solely on protected areas to preserve biodiversity. Such 
reliance can create a paradoxical situation in which species and 
ecosystems inside the protected areas are preserved while the 
same species and ecosystems outside are allowed to be 
damaged, which in turn results in . 
This is due in part to the fact that many species must migrate 
across protected area boundaries to access resources that the 
protected area itself cannot provide. In India, for example, 
tigers leave their protected areas to hunt in the surrounding 
human-dominated landscape. In general, the smaller the 
protected area, the more it depends on unprotected neighboring 
lands for the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. 
Unprotected areas, including those immediately outside 
protected areas, are thus crucial to an overall conservation 
strategy. [3점]
① the decline of biodiversity within the protected areas
② the fall in migration of species to the unprotected areas
③ the increase of predators’ migration to the protected areas
④ the balance and harmony between humanity and biodiversity
33. Our kitchens owe much to the brilliance of science, and a 
cook experimenting with mixtures at the stove is often not 
very different from a chemist in the lab: we add vinegar to red 
cabbage to fix the color and use baking soda to counteract the 
acidity of lemon in the cake. It is wrong to suppose, however, 
that . 
It is something more basic and older than this. Not every 
culture has had formal science ― a form of organized 
knowledge about the universe that starts with Aristotle in the 
fourth century BC. The modern scientific method, in which 
experiments form part of a structured system of hypothesis, 
experimentation, and analysis is as recent as the seventeenth 
century; the problem-solving technology of cooking goes back 
thousands of years. Since the earliest Stone Age humans cut 
raw food with sharpened flints, we have always used invention 
to devise better ways to feed ourselves. [3점] 
① science has nothing to do with philosophy
② a hypothesis can be proved by a single experiment
③ technology is just the appliance of scientific thought
④ cooking has always been independent from formal science
⑤ food is cooked only through the problem-solving technology

For any product, the last step of the recycling process is 
selling the new product. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find 
markets for some types of recyclables. Plastic companies 
generally prefer new plastic, (A) , because it is of 
more consistent quality than recycled plastic. The new plastic 
is guaranteed to be free of incompatible polymers ― the 
chemical from which plastics are made ― that sometimes are 
mixed in when the plastic is not sorted well before recycling. 
Manufacturers say it is also easier to control the color of 
plastics that have no recycled content. (B) , paper 
manufacturers complain that recycled paper often gets dirty

Who could deny that the human body is a miracle? Imagine: 
each of us is safely housed within a bundle of blood, bone, 
and guts nurturing a little glow of life while suspended in a 
sea of constant change and danger.
(A) In other words, traditional housing approaches were 
specific to the culture, climate, and environment. Consider 
the igloo, a building using the thermal mass of ice to 
enclose heat and resist snow, or the ancient Egyptians’ 
ventilation domes that produced interior cooling amid 
burning desert heat. 
(B) Housing, likewise, originally developed slowly within 
particular human cultures and in response to specific 
climates and environments. Each culture around the world 
crafted a unique style of housing from the fabric of their 
surroundings. 
(C) The miracle becomes even more amazing when you 
consider the long, slow, evolutionary process of give and 
take that produced the human body. Our bodies developed 
with nature, within it, as part of it, over time.

Adolescence is a stage of development in which teens have 
superb cognitive abilities and high rates of learning and 
memory because they are still riding on the heightened 
synaptic plasticity of childhood. 
(A) This means a little bit of stimulation to a teenage brain 
whose synapses are firing all over the place leads to 
wanting more stimulation that can, in certain situations, 
result in a kind of overlearning. The more commonly 
known name for this overlearning is addiction. 
(B) These abilities give them a distinct advantage over adults, 
but because they are so primed to learn, they are also 
extremely vulnerable to learning the wrong things. How 
does this happen?
(C) It is all because the brain wants rewards and anything that 
is learned, good or bad, that stimulates the production of 
dopamine is interpreted by the brain as a reward.

But if you poured a small bucket of water into the line first, 
the empty space was quickly eliminated, enabling the water 
to flow with less effort. 
Undoing a negative tie begins with giving up something of 
value rather than asking for a “fair trade.” If you give and then 
ask for something right away in return, you don’t establish a 
relationship; you carry out a transaction. ( ① ) When done 
correctly, reciprocity is like getting the pump ready. ( ② ) In 
the old days, pumps required lots of effort to produce any 
water. ( ③ ) You had to repeatedly work a lever to eliminate a 
vacuum in the line before water could flow. ( ④ ) Reciprocity 
with a rival works in much the same way. ( ⑤ ) Reflect 
carefully on what you should give and, ideally, choose 
something that requires little effort from the other party to 
reciprocate.

In a different paradigm, human health and ecological survival 
would be paramount, and industrial activities that undermine 
these goals would be prohibited outright. 
Unfortunately many organizations and political leaders 
working to improve environmental and social conditions operate 
unquestioningly from within the paradigm. ( ① ) However, to 
paraphrase Einstein, problems cannot be solved from within the 
same paradigm in which they were created. ( ② ) A good 
example is the cap and trade approach to reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. ( ③ ) In this scenario, private companies are 
permitted to sell their “right” to pollute to other companies, 
which can then pollute more, in the belief that the free hand of 
the market will find the most efficient opportunities for 
greenhouse gas reductions. ( ④ ) But viewing pollution as a 
“right” and relying on the market to solve environmental 
problems reinforces the very paradigm that got us into this 
mess. ( ⑤ ) The right to clean air and a healthy climate would 
win over the right to pollute. [3점]

Not until the rise of ecology at the beginning of the twentieth 
century did people begin to think seriously of land as a natural 
system with interconnecting parts. ① A century earlier, 
Thomas Jefferson had vigorously promoted an orderly division 
of the American land, beginning with the Northwest Territory. 
② Surveyors were sent forth to draw rectangular grids on the 
land, dividing the wilds into counties, townships, and ultimately 
homesteads, with little concern for terrain or other natural 
features. ③ They adopted the environmentally friendly system 
even though they did not see a profit in it. ④ That system had 
its virtues, but in time ecology made the lines appear artificial. 
⑤ As some observers would come to see it, the rectangular 
grid system caused as much harm as it did good.

Mitterer and de Ruiter used a color categorization paradigm 
to study the relationship between “world knowledge” and 
color categories. First, half of the observers saw typically 
orange objects (e.g., carrot) in a good orange and typically 
yellow objects (e.g., banana) in a hue midway between 
orange and yellow. The other half saw typically orange 
objects in the intermediate hue and typically yellow objects 
in a good yellow. Later, observers were asked to categorize 
a color-neutral object (e.g., sock) colored somewhere 
between yellow and orange as either yellow or orange. The 
researchers found that if the observers had seen typically 
yellow objects in the intermediate hue, this hue was 
subsequently categorized as yellow. The reverse was true 
for the observers who had seen typically orange objects in 
the intermediate hue. 
󰀻
After observers were (A)  a typically yellow or 
orange object in an intermediate hue, they thought the 
intermediate hue of a color-neutral object (B)  
the category of the previous object’s typical color. 
(A) (B)

The overabundance of available storage capacity makes it 
easy for us to shift our behavioral default regarding external 
memory from forgetting to remembering. We save different 
versions of the documents we are working on to our hard disks. 
And we store images and music files, on the assumption that 
perhaps some day we might need them. Storing information has 
become fantastically convenient, but it’s more than convenience 
that makes us preserve. The truth is that the economics of 
storage have made forgetting brutally expensive. Consider 
digital cameras: When you connect your camera to your 
computer to upload the images you took onto your hard disk, 
you are usually given a choice. You can either select which 
images to upload, or have your computer copy automatically all 
images from your camera. Reassured perhaps by the soothing 
idea that one can always go through them later and delete the 
images one does not like, invariably most people choose the 
latter option. Economically speaking, this makes sense. 
Assuming it takes only three seconds for a person to look at an 
image and decide whether to preserve it or not, and that she 
values her own time at a current average wage, the “cost” of 
the time alone that it takes to decide  the cost of 
storage. With such an abundance of cheap storage, it is simply 
no longer economical to even decide whether to remember or 
forget. Forgetting ― the three seconds it takes to choose ― has 
become too expensive for people to use.

[43 ~ 45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
Julia, a counsellor, recently encountered an example of the 
joyful turning point while working with her client Angela. 
Angela came to see Julia because she was having doubts about 
her career plans. For the last three years Angela had worked as 
a legal analyst at a company. The problem was that (a) she 
didn’t have much of a passion for law. She had never enjoyed 
reading law books, or attended a legal workshop because she 
was eager to learn.   

(B)
Julia kept encouraging Angela and Angela began to think 
about how she could get involved in acting. She remembered 
that there were some people at her work who were interested 
in acting. The next week at work, Angela sent an email to her 
colleagues announcing her interest in starting a drama group. 
Four people agreed to join her. When Angela described their 
first meeting during (b) her next session with Julia, she was 
so excited that she was practically leaping out of her chair.
(C)
As Angela described her situation, Julia noted that there was 
little enthusiasm in her voice. So the first thing (c) she 
decided to do was to help Angela increase the fun in her life. 
Julia asked her if there were any fun things she would like to 
do. Angela mentioned that for a long time she had wanted to get 
back into acting, which she used to do in college. As (d) she 
talked about her acting experiences, she spoke 
enthusiastically and Julia felt it was like watching an entirely 
different person.
(D)
Now Angela realized that she wanted to work in a setting 
where she could interact with many different types of people 
in a fun, supportive way. This, she saw, was unlikely to occur 
in the legal profession. After exploring many possibilities, 
Angela ended up becoming a drama teacher at a high school. 
She has found that (e) she no longer needed to be a “zombie” 
at work. She is now free to let her enthusiastic personality 
come out.
