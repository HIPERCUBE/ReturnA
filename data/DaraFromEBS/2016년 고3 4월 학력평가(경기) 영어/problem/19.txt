19. 다음 글에 드러난 Matt Brown의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Early in his career as a pilot, Matt Brown was flying a 
twin-engine plane northeast out of Harlingen, Texas, when he 
noticed a drop in oil pressure in his right engine. He was alone, 
flying through the night at eleven thousand feet. He reduced 
altitude and kept an eye on the oil gauge, hoping to fly as far as 
a planned fuel stop in Louisiana, where he could service the 
plane, but the pressure kept falling. Matt has been messing 
around with piston engines since he was old enough to hold a 
wrench, and he knew he had a problem. If he let the oil 
pressure get too low, he risked the engine’s stopping. How 
much further could he fly before shutting it down? What would 
happen when he did? He breathed heavily and felt the dreadful 
cold sweat running down his back.
