30. Since most of you are working on a word processor, it 
seems silly to spend too much time on spelling. Your 
word-processing program will spell check items for you.
(A) , spelling is not a completely lost art. There 
are words that are not in the spell checker’s dictionary. 
Also, your spell checker will not help you if you 
misspell a word and mistakenly turn it into another word. 
(B) , when you write ‘lightening’ instead of 
‘lightning,’ the program will not recognize the error. So, get 
in the habit of rereading your work and looking up words 
that the spell checker does not pick up. You need to 
develop the skill of knowing when words look wrong. 
Never hand something in until you have checked it.
(A) (B)
① However …… For example
② However …… Therefore
③ That is …… Similarly
④ In addition …… For example
⑤ In addition …… Therefore
