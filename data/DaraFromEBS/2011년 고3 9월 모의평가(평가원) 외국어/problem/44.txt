The smartest of our deep ancestors would have stored 
their excess meat in the bodies and minds of others 
(not just their own kin).
Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that the 
absence of any effective form of refrigeration was critical 
to our early moral development. Let’s say that you’re an 
early humanoid hunting and gathering on the African 
savannah and you strike it lucky. ( ① ) You come 
across a huge beast and you manage to kill it. ( ② ) It 
yields far more meat than anyone involved in the hunt or 
their families can possibly consume. ( ③ ) How do you 
get the most benefit of your excess meat without a fridge, 
or anywhere to store it? ( ④ ) Provided those benefiting 
from your gift could possibly repay your generosity in the 
future, that was the best thing you could do with excess 
meat. ( ⑤ ) Groups of early humans who developed 
stable relationships and practiced this sort of mutual 
altruism were in a better position to prosper and multiply.
