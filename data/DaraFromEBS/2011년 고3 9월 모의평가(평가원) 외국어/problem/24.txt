24. Science is making the future, and nations are busy 
making future scientists. The more science that emerges 
from this investment, the greater the need for us to follow 
the gist of the science with sufficient understanding. In 
other words, if we the ordinary people are to keep pace 
with science, we need more science writers, and more 
science writing that is clear, wise and eloquent, and that 
demands to be read. People often feel excluded from 
science, convinced that it takes an advanced degree to 
understand what scientists do. As a result, they defensively 
shrug off the whole business as an exclusive realm of little 
relevance to their lives. One of the surest cures for 
scientific is great scientific literature, 
writing that does not merely translate technical terms into 
plain English or explain complicated ideas simply.
