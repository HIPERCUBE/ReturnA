42. About twenty years ago, Time magazine described a 
study by a psychologist of people who had lost their jobs 
three times due to plant closings. The writers were amazed 
by what they discovered. They expected the people being 
laid off to be beaten down and discouraged. Instead they 
found them to be incredibly resilient. Why was that? They 
concluded that people who had weathered repeated 
adversity had learned to bounce back. People who had lost 
a job and found a new one twice before were much better 
prepared to deal with adversity than someone who had 
always worked at the same place and had never faced 
adversity. It may sound ironic, but if you have experienced 
a lot of failure, you are actually in a better position to 
achieve success than people who have not.
