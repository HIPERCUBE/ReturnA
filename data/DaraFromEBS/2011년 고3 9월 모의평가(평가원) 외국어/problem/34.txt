34. Some species seem to have a stronger influence than others 
on their ecosystem. Take away the sea stars along the northwest 
coast of the United States, for instance, and the ecosystem 
changes dramatically; in the absence of these sea stars, their 
favorite prey, mussels, takes over and makes it hard for other 
species that used to live there. Sea stars are known as 
keystone species, because as top predators they determine 
ecosystem structure by their eating habits. If you chop down 
an aspen tree by a beaver pond, not much will happen; but if 
you take away a beaver, a wetland might dry out, changing 
the kinds of plants that live there and the animals that rely on 
them. Because beavers exert their influence by physically 
altering the landscape, they are known as ecosystem engineers.
