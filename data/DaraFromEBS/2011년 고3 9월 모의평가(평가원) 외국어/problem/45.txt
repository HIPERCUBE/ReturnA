A bumper sticker reading “Don’t Believe Everything 
You Think” is placed on the edge of the whiteboard in 
Greene’s office. It represents the underlying message of 
the book he is writing. An analogy carried throughout 
the book compares the moral brain to a camera with 
automatic settings for taking a picture of a mountain or 
an indoor portrait or a close-up of a flower, and manual 
settings for unusual conditions or when we want a 
nonstandard artistic effect. Greene believes emotions and 
intuitions are the auto settings for our morality while 
reasoning is the manual mode.
We need our intuitions to make the millions of quick 
judgments that fill our lives from day to day or else we 
could not function. But they are not always trustworthy 
moral indicators, since they were set to handle problems 
deep in our evolutionary past and are often useless for 
the newer complexities of the modern world. We need to 
rely on our manual settings, the reasoning sections of our 
brain, for more complex or novel situations, Greene says.
