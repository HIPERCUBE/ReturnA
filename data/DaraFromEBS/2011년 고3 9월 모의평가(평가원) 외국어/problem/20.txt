20. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 어법에 맞는 표현으로 가장 
적절한 것은?
You have to pay close attention to someone’s normal 
pattern in order to notice a deviation from it when he or she 
lies. Sometimes the variation is as (A) subtle / subtly  as a 
pause. Other times it is obvious and abrupt. I recently saw a 
news interview with an acquaintance (B) who / whom  I was 
certain was going to lie about a few particularly sensitive 
issues, and lie she did. During most of her interview she was 
calm and direct, but when she started lying, her manner 
changed dramatically: she threw her head back, laughed in 
‘disbelief,’ and shook her head back and forth. It is true that 
the questions (C) dealt / dealing  with very personal issues, 
but I have found that in general, no matter how touchy the 
question, if a person is telling the truth his or her manner 
will not change significantly or abruptly.
(A) (B) (C)
① subtle …… who …… dealt
② subtle …… who …… dealing
③ subtle …… whom …… dealt
④ subtly …… who …… dealt
