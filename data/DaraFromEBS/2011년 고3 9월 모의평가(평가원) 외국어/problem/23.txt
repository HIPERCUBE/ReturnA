Effective leaders set the tone for the entire organization. 
It’s not a matter of knowing more than everyone else. There 
are plenty of leaders who are not the biggest experts in their 
companies. But it does mean working hard, something anyone 
can do. Be the first person to arrive at the workplace and be 
the last one to leave. If you can do that, you will already be 
light years ahead of most managers in the respect you will 
gain from your team members. Apply the same principle to all 
your routine activities. If you expect your sales force to make 
50 calls each day, make 100 calls yourself. It is not rocket 
science. It is just basic ‘lead by example’ management. No 
one can really discredit leaders who are the hardest-working 
individuals in their organizations.
