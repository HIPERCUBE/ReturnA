25.  . If I assign fifty students a 
five-page essay on the subject of why the Roman Empire 
fell, most of them are likely to say it was a combination 
of economic and social causes ultimately leading to a 
weakening of the frontiers. This would be a fine answer, 
but after reading forty-five papers all saying the same 
thing, I’m ready for a change. If you can take a different 
angle from the rest of the class in a paper, you’re more 
likely to impress your professors. But here’s the tricky 
part― being different is risky, and it only works if you 
back up your argument very well. If you choose to argue 
that Rome fell solely because Christianity weakened the 
fighting spirit of the Romans, you will need persuasive 
reasoning and arguments against any potential objections.
