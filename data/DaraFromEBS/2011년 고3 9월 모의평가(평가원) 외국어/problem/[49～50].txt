The McDonald’s restaurants that are located across the 
United States― and, increasingly, the world― have a 
significance that goes far beyond the convenience of quick 
hamburgers, milk shakes, and salads. As sociologist George 
Ritzer says, our everyday lives are being ‘McDonaldized.’
The McDonaldization of society does not refer just to 
the robotlike assembly of food. This term refers to the 
standardization of everyday life, a process that is transforming 
our lives. Want to do some shopping? Shopping malls offer 
one-stop shopping in controlled environments. Planning a 
trip? Travel agencies offer ‘package’ tours. They will 
transport middle-class Americans to ten European capitals 
in fourteen days. All visitors experience the same hotels, 
restaurants, and other scheduled sites.
Efficiency brings dependability. You can expect your 
burger and fries to taste the same whether you buy them 
in Los Angeles or Beijing. Although efficiency also lowers 
prices, it does come at a cost. Predictability washes away 
spontaneity, changing the quality of our lives. It produces 
a sameness, a bland version of what used to be unique 
experiences. In my own travels, for example, had I taken 
packaged tours I never would have had the eye-opening 
experiences that have added so much to my appreciation of 
human diversity. For good or bad, our lives are being 
McDonaldized, and the predictability of packaged settings 
seems to be our social destiny. Our coming prepackaged 
society will be , of course. But it also means 
that we will be trapped in the ‘iron cage’ of bureaucracy
― just as Weber warned would happen.
