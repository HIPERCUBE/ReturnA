41. The green revolution was a mixed blessing. Over time 
farmers came to rely heavily on broadly adapted, high-yield 
crops to the exclusion of varieties adapted to local 
conditions. Monocropping vast fields with the same 
genetically uniform seeds helps boost yield and meet 
immediate hunger needs. Yet high-yield varieties are also 
genetically weaker crops that require expensive chemical 
fertilizers and toxic pesticides. The same holds true for 
high-yield livestock breeds, which often require expensive 
feed and medicinal care to survive in foreign climates. The 
drive to increase production is pushing out local varieties, 
diluting livestock’s genetic diversity in the process. As a 
result, the world’s food supply has become largely 
dependent on a shrinking list of breeds designed for 
maximum yield. In short, in our focus on increasing the 
amount of food we produce today, we have accidentally put 
ourselves at risk for food shortages in the future.
