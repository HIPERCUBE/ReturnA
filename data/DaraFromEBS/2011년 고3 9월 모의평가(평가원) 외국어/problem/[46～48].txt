(A)
I grew up in a small town in northern California, 
between wide-open ranchland and dark forests, feeling at 
home in two places: the wild land and books. I read 
constantly, hungrily, and without direction, collecting a 
strange stew of facts and ideas about the rest of the 
world. I longed for a world away from what I knew 
and outrageously outside my means.
(B)
The important lesson I learned at (a) Billups― the world 
was a lot bigger than I had imagined it to be― was a little 
painful. It meant I was a lot smaller than I’d realized. I 
went on to attend a state university and I began to write 
about my disappearing dreams and new dreams, about 
wishing and disappointment and feeling small. One day a 
professor (b) there took hold of me and said, “You’re a 
writer.” Until then, I hadn’t really known. I had to figure 
out who I was not going to be before I could get on to 
who I was. The lesson from Billups lay below the surface, 
but when I began to write, it rose like flowers and bloomed 
into words and stories and books, and me.
(C)
One morning I came across a catalog for a college 
preparatory school called Billups Academy. (c) It had a 
summer program and offered scholarships for high 
school students to ‘deepen and extend their intellectual, 
aesthetic, and moral interests.’ I applied for and won a 
scholarship. Billups wasn’t just another school― it was 
another world. I was used to big skies, wild water, 
snakes and horses, and solitude. What waited for me in 
(d) this new world was tree-lined avenues, brick 
buildings with white pillars, and a wood-paneled library.
(D)
Unlike back at home, in (e) the new school, I was no 
longer the smartest kid in the classroom. I wasn’t the most 
talented, or the least. Before going to Billups, one of my 
dreams was to become a photographer. That dream came to 
an abrupt halt in a photography class. There was no 
denying in the other students’ pictures that they were far 
more talented than I was. I became severely depressed as 
one dream after another faded from me. Then, on the last 
night of the summer program, it hit me. I had been blind 
to a lesson that was staring at me in the face.
