35. As striking as the Greeks’ freedom and individuality is 
their sense of curiosity about the world. Aristotle thought 
that curiosity was the uniquely defining property of human 
beings. ① St. Luke said of the Athenians of a later era: 
“They spend their time in nothing else but to tell or to hear 
some new thing.” ② The Greeks, far more than their 
contemporaries, speculated about the nature of the world 
they found themselves in and created models of it. ③ Slaves 
played an important role in Greek society and their status 
was dependent on how much labor they contributed to the 
society. ④ They constructed these models by categorizing 
objects and events and generating rules about them that 
were sufficiently precise for systematic description and 
explanation. ⑤ This characterized their advances in the fields 
of physics, astronomy, geometry, rational philosophy, and 
natural history.
