The two­year­old child dances for her father when he 
comes home, before he takes her in his arms. The smallest 
child who is capable of any action is capable of making it 
worth watching, of capturing adult attention for a time. As 
we grow up we learn that we cannot expect the attention of 
others as often as we would like to have it; still we are 
watchers of ourselves and of each other, and if we believe 
in God or gods we believe we are being watched from 
above. Even if we don’t, we can’t always escape the thought 
that our parents are watching us. In deciding what to do or 
how to do it, we often ask ourselves what these watchers 
would think of us. And then we pretend. We tell ourselves 
stories about what we are doing as individuals, framing our 
actions all the while as deserving an audience. To imagine 
yourself totally without an audience would be painful and 
difficult.
