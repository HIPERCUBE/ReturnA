30. Fundamental to most moral approaches is the idea that 
human life has a special dignity and value that is worth 
preserving even at the expense of self­interest. From this 
belief it follows, as Charles Beitz notes in his classic work 
Political Theory and International Relations, “that there are 
occasions when we have reasons to disregard the demands 
of self­interest by taking a moral point of view towards 
human affairs.” This requires, says Beitz, that we regard the 
world and our actions in it from the standpoint of one 
person among many rather than as a particular person with 
particular interests. This position requires us to choose 
courses of action, policies, rules, and institutions on grounds 
that would be acceptable to any agent who was             
among competing interests involved. [3점]
