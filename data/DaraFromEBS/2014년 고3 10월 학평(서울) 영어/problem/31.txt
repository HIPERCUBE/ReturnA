31. People who use visualization as a support for cancer 
treatment and other life­threatening illnesses have discovered 
the importance of                 . For example, after 
Carl’s cancer diagnosis he began visualizing the cancer cells 
being killed by soldiers. It was only after work with his 
therapist that he realized this could not be effective for him 
as he had been a committed pacifist for a long time. His 
subconscious would not easily welcome a warlike image. He 
settled on using an image of the cancer cells being rescued 
from their path of destruction by angels and taken to a 
place of reeducation where they could become “good” cells. 
It worked for him, and he is convinced that his belief in the 
principle and his consistency in practicing it positively 
supported his medical treatment and cure. [3점]
