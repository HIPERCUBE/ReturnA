There are a variety of currents in the oceans, and because 
they move and mix the water they will influence various 
aspects of the environment. One especially important 
environmental impact of currents is that they can move 
nutrients from deep water to the surface, where these 
nutrients can be used by plants, in the photosynthetic 
process, to produce organic matter. Currents can also 
disperse waste products, eggs, larvae, and adult life­forms. 
Some fish lay their eggs in or near a current, which may 
then carry the eggs and young into an environment favorable 
for growth. By mixing ocean water, currents keep 
water­temperature changes to a minimum. Turbulence caused 
by currents adds oxygen to the water ― oxygen that fish 
need.                            * turbulence: (물결의) 휘몰아침
