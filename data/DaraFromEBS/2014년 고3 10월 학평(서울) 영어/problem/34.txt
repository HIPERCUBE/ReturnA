Sitting motionless, leaning back against the trunk of a tall 
and shady pine tree, breathing in the fresh air, I was the 
sole visitor to my childhood beach. The early morning had 
already begun to warm up, as was normal for summer 
mornings in Bimini. The coarse white sand stuck to the back 
of my legs and thighs but provided a cool feeling. The 
gentle lapping sounds of the quiet ocean were fascinating as 
the tide lazily trickled onto the beach. Not a creature was 
stirring. No vehicles passed along the narrow hill street, 
which seemed to always have a constant stream of scooters 
and trucks racing by. No boats cruised the still sea. Even 
the seagulls were still resting! The beach at dawn provided 
the perfect place for meditation.
