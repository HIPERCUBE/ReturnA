People in reasonably good health at the age of 60 can now 
expect to live close to thirty more years. These can be the 
happiest years of their lives, since the pressures of earning 
a living, building a career, and raising a family are behind 
them. Workers can use their “golden years” to do many of 
the things they had always hoped to do, but never had the 
opportunity to do because of their 40­plus­hour workweeks. 
Unfortunately, the cost of these additional retirement years 
can present a problem if there is insufficient financial 
preparation. Therefore, a retirement plan needs to be set in 
motion at an early stage of life to assure that retirement is 
all that it can be.

The two­year­old child dances for her father when he 
comes home, before he takes her in his arms. The smallest 
child who is capable of any action is capable of making it 
worth watching, of capturing adult attention for a time. As 
we grow up we learn that we cannot expect the attention of 
others as often as we would like to have it; still we are 
watchers of ourselves and of each other, and if we believe 
in God or gods we believe we are being watched from 
above. Even if we don’t, we can’t always escape the thought 
that our parents are watching us. In deciding what to do or 
how to do it, we often ask ourselves what these watchers 
would think of us. And then we pretend. We tell ourselves 
stories about what we are doing as individuals, framing our 
actions all the while as deserving an audience. To imagine 
yourself totally without an audience would be painful and 
difficult.

In one study, fourteen­month­olds watched an adult 
experimenter bend over and activate a light by pressing the 
button with her head. For some of the infants, the adult’s 
hands were bound by a blanket. The babies were then given 
the light switch to play with. Infants who saw the adult 
whose arms were bound activated the light switch with their 
hand because they understood that the adult was unable to 
use their hands. However, if they were the ones who saw 
that the adult’s hands were free, then the infants bent over 
and activated the button with their head, too. They must 
have reasoned that it was important to use the head and not 
the hands. Infants were not simply copying the actions but 
rather repeating the intended goal.

22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
There are a variety of currents in the oceans, and because 
they move and mix the water they will influence various 
aspects of the environment. One especially important 
environmental impact of currents is that they can move 
nutrients from deep water to the surface, where these 
nutrients can be used by plants, in the photosynthetic 
process, to produce organic matter. Currents can also 
disperse waste products, eggs, larvae, and adult life­forms. 
Some fish lay their eggs in or near a current, which may 
then carry the eggs and young into an environment favorable 
for growth. By mixing ocean water, currents keep 
water­temperature changes to a minimum. Turbulence caused 
by currents adds oxygen to the water ― oxygen that fish 
need.                            * turbulence: (물결의) 휘몰아침

In most wilderness, the majority of groups ① visiting the 
area are small ― usually between two and four people. But 
large groups do visit wilderness, and their potential to 
disturb campsites differs from ②that of small groups. 
Although the effect of party size on campsites has never been 
formally studied, it makes sense that a large group can cause 
impacts on an undisturbed site more ③rapidly than a small 
group. For example, along the New River in West Virginia, 
the area of vegetation loss on sites used by large commercial 
rafting companies ④were more than four times larger than 
the area on sites used by small groups of fishermen. At 
well­established campsites, however, a big group need not be 
a problem, as long as activities are ⑤ confined within the 
boundaries of the existing site.

How America Spends Money: 
100 Years in the Life of the Family Budget
The graph above shows the changes in the percentage of 
spending on five components in the American family budget 
for about a century from 1900 to 2003. ① During the whole 
period, the proportion of spending on food dropped most 
sharply and it took up less than 15 percent in 2003. ② On 
the other hand, the percentage of spending on housing 
increased steadily, and in 2003 it eventually surpassed the 
percentage of spending on food. ③ In the case of apparel, 
the percentage steadily decreased during the period, and it 
was the second smallest among the five components in 
2003. ④ For half a century from 1900 to 1950, the 
proportion of spending on health care remained the same, 
and then it rose to about 6 percent in 2003. ⑤ From 1950 
to 2003, the percentages of spending on two components 
decreased, but the percentages of spending on three 
components increased.
27. coral bean에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Whether in flower or in fruit, coral bean is one of the 
most striking plants in the American Southwest. Much of the 
year, however, the leafless brown stems are scarcely 
noticeable in their rocky hillside habitat. In June, clusters of 
red flowers sprout from the stem tips, attracting 
hummingbirds. Leaves appear once the summer rains start, 
usually in July. Coral bean plants are most noticeable in the 
autumn when their leaves have turned golden and the brown 
pods reveal the (occasionally light brown) seeds. Alkaloids 
make coral bean seeds highly toxic. In the Southwest, winter 
temperatures prevent coral bean from growing much taller 
than three feet, but in the frost­free parts of northern 
Mexico, it is a small tree up to twenty feet tall.

Benny Tee was one of my very good friends. He ran a 
retail shoe store near my house. Two weeks before Christmas 
a poor man walked into Benny’s store. Looking around at all 
the shoes, he asked, “Are you Mr. Tee?” and Benny said, 
“Yes.” “I want a special pair of shoes for ① my son.” 
Standing next to him was an eleven­year­old boy dressed in 
shabby clothes. Benny looked down at the boy’s feet and 
saw that ② he had club feet. His father explained, “The one 
thing my son wants for Christmas is a pair of shoes like the 
other kids. Could you make them for ③ him?” Benny said, 
“Yes, but it will take time to order a special kind of leather 
to make shoes for ④ him. I can’t promise they’ll be done by 
Christmas.” The leather didn’t come until the 24th. It took 
Benny until 4:00 in the morning of Christmas Day to complete 
his work. But when ⑤ he kindly delivered the special pair of 
shoes to the boy’s home, Benny Tee received the best 
Christmas gift of his life. He received Joy.

30. Fundamental to most moral approaches is the idea that 
human life has a special dignity and value that is worth 
preserving even at the expense of self­interest. From this 
belief it follows, as Charles Beitz notes in his classic work 
Political Theory and International Relations, “that there are 
occasions when we have reasons to disregard the demands 
of self­interest by taking a moral point of view towards 
human affairs.” This requires, says Beitz, that we regard the 
world and our actions in it from the standpoint of one 
person among many rather than as a particular person with 
particular interests. This position requires us to choose 
courses of action, policies, rules, and institutions on grounds 
that would be acceptable to any agent who was             
among competing interests involved. [3점]
① impartial ② ambitious ③ renowned
④ selfish ⑤ imaginative
31. People who use visualization as a support for cancer 
treatment and other life­threatening illnesses have discovered 
the importance of                 . For example, after 
Carl’s cancer diagnosis he began visualizing the cancer cells 
being killed by soldiers. It was only after work with his 
therapist that he realized this could not be effective for him 
as he had been a committed pacifist for a long time. His 
subconscious would not easily welcome a warlike image. He 
settled on using an image of the cancer cells being rescued 
from their path of destruction by angels and taken to a 
place of reeducation where they could become “good” cells. 
It worked for him, and he is convinced that his belief in the 
principle and his consistency in practicing it positively 
supported his medical treatment and cure. [3점]
* pacifist: 평화주의자
① focusing on symptoms
② frequency of treatment
③ careful image selection
④ support from family members
⑤ using high­tech medical equipment
32. Subjective well­being is at least partly temporary in 
response to the consumption of new and novel consumer 
goods. Pleasure has a stable component dependent on the 
accustomed consumption flows, but it also has a component 
that is dependent on change. Once the change occurs and 
the new consumer item becomes a part of the daily 
consumption bundle, the pleasure of novelty disappears and 
overall satisfaction returns to the original amount. A new 
kind of cereal at breakfast will temporarily add to our 
pleasure, but eventually our enjoyment of breakfast will 
return to its normal level. Also, as our incomes and material 
standards rise, so do our expected achievements. The 
purchase of a second automobile made possible by rising 
income increases our subjective well­being, but at the same 
time our aspirations rise and a second car becomes a part of 
our consumption expectations.                               
returns our subjective well­being to its normal amount. [3점]
① The realization that our income is losing its buying power
② Feeling increasing gap between our income and 
aspirations
③ Development in technology resulting from repeated use of 
new products
④ The ever­decreasing income due to the global economic 
crisis
⑤ The shrinkage in the gap between our expectations and 
realizations

The dog’s natural tendency to memorize landmarks can 
actually hinder training. Younger dogs are so good at 
learning locations that they often spontaneously memorize 
their surroundings as part of the set of cues that tells them 
to do something. (A) , puppies taught the verbal 
command “sit” in a training class may appear to have 
forgotten it as soon as they get home ― because, in addition 
to the command, they have spontaneously memorized as the 
relevant cue some feature of the room where the class was 
held and, in different surroundings, do not recognize the 
command. (B) , many dog trainers repeat a training 
exercise in a variety of places, in order to break such 
associations and isolate the intended cue, in this case, the 
verbal command alone.

Sitting motionless, leaning back against the trunk of a tall 
and shady pine tree, breathing in the fresh air, I was the 
sole visitor to my childhood beach. The early morning had 
already begun to warm up, as was normal for summer 
mornings in Bimini. The coarse white sand stuck to the back 
of my legs and thighs but provided a cool feeling. The 
gentle lapping sounds of the quiet ocean were fascinating as 
the tide lazily trickled onto the beach. Not a creature was 
stirring. No vehicles passed along the narrow hill street, 
which seemed to always have a constant stream of scooters 
and trucks racing by. No boats cruised the still sea. Even 
the seagulls were still resting! The beach at dawn provided 
the perfect place for meditation.

35. As striking as the Greeks’ freedom and individuality is 
their sense of curiosity about the world. Aristotle thought 
that curiosity was the uniquely defining property of human 
beings. ① St. Luke said of the Athenians of a later era: 
“They spend their time in nothing else but to tell or to hear 
some new thing.” ② The Greeks, far more than their 
contemporaries, speculated about the nature of the world 
they found themselves in and created models of it. ③ Slaves 
played an important role in Greek society and their status 
was dependent on how much labor they contributed to the 
society. ④ They constructed these models by categorizing 
objects and events and generating rules about them that 
were sufficiently precise for systematic description and 
explanation. ⑤ This characterized their advances in the fields 
of physics, astronomy, geometry, rational philosophy, and 
natural history.
36. The tongue map was based on German research published 
in 1901, but Edwin Boring, an influential Harvard 
psychologist, mistranslated it. ① What the original research 
had shown was that the human tongue has areas of relative 
sensitivity to different tastes, but his translation stated that 
each could only be tasted in one zone. ② What is really 
mysterious about the tongue map is that it was the official 
truth for such a long time, even though it’s so easily 
disproved. ③ The sense of taste is related to the sense of 
smell and that is why we can’t detect tastes well when we 
have a runny nose. ④ It wasn’t until 1974 that another 
American scientist, Dr. Virginia Collings, reexamined the 
original theory. ⑤ She showed that, though sensitivity to the 
four main tastes did vary around the tongue, it was only to 
an insignificant degree.

Years ago, when I was working with dogs in Europe, I 
witnessed an intelligence test given by some of the 
foremost trainers and behaviorists in the field. 
(A) I, on the other hand, concluded the poodle was the 
smartest of all the dogs tested. When confronted with 
this obstacle, he analyzed the situation and chose the 
easiest way of achieving the goal of getting to the 
other side of the wall ― he simply walked around it! 
(B) The test involved having various breeds of dog 
negotiate a high wall in order to get to the other side. 
Dog after dog jumped over the wall. Finally, it was the 
standard poodle’s turn. The poodle stood there for a 
moment, as if to size up the obstacle in front of him. 
(C) Then he casually walked around the wall and joined his 
fellow competitors on the other side of it. These 
so­called experts concluded that the poodle had failed 
the test ― he hadn’t possessed the intelligence to jump 
over it.

Evidence of using food to heal dates back thousands of 
years. Ayurveda, the traditional healing art of India, is a 
perfect example.
(A) It often shows up as a spice in Asian cuisine. Aside 
from its unique flavor, turmeric may also prove a 
helpful treatment for people with arthritis, Alzheimer’s 
disease, and some forms of cancer. 
(B) This healing art borrows many of its ideas from

herbs, massage, and meditation. Ayurvedic practitioners 
may even go so far as to try a new food to heal. One 
medicinal food from Ayurveda may be familiar to you: 
turmeric.

certainly is highly recommended for these conditions. 
My own experience of using turmeric as an

Traits, on the other hand, are more stable characteristics 
that endure across time.
Psychologists make the distinction between dispositions, or 
traits, and states, or momentary feelings. ( ① ) Think of 
some moments of happiness or despair you have 
experienced, such as when you won a prize or got an 
exciting job offer, or when somebody died. ( ② ) These 
experiences are states of happiness or sadness; they reflect 
the transient highs and lows of everyday life. ( ③ ) These 
are the emotional styles or ways of thinking that remain 
fairly steadfast across our lives. ( ④ ) Mary has “Mary­like” 
characteristics that remain fairly stable, just as Dave stays 
“Dave­like” under all circumstances. ( ⑤ ) Cheerful, happy 
babies tend to become adventurous, outgoing children who 
tend to become extroverted, sociable adults.

Centuries ago, philosophers regarded memory as a soft 
wax tablet that would preserve anything imprinted on it. 
With the advent of the printing press, people began to 
think of memory as a library that stores events and 
facts for later retrieval. (Those of us of a certain age 
still think of it that way, muttering about where we 
“filed” information in our mental cabinets.) With the 
inventions of movies and tape recorders, people started 
thinking of memory as a video camera, clicking on at the 
moment of birth and automatically recording every 
moment thereafter. Nowadays we think of memory in 
computer terms, and although some of us wish for more 
RAM, we assume that just about everything that happens 
to us is “saved.” Your brain might not choose to screen 
all those memories, but they are in there, just waiting 
for you to retrieve them.

Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz’s “Freaky Friday 
Management Technique” tells an interesting story about 
personnel management. He once led a company where the 
customer support and sales engineering departments 
wouldn’t work together and spoiled each other’s work. He 
was embarrassed because both teams had talented people, 
so he didn’t want to fire anyone, but the company’s 
success depended on their . Then he saw the 
film Freaky Friday, starring Barbara Harris and Jodie 
Foster, where mother and daughter grow completely 
frustrated with each other’s lack of understanding and 
wish that they could switch places and they do. By being 
inside each other’s bodies, both characters develop an 
excellent understanding of the challenges that the other 
faces. As a result, the two women become great friends 
when they switch back. Horowitz decided to apply the 
technique: “The very next day I informed the head of 
Sales Engineering and the head of Customer Support that 
they would be switching jobs.”
Both managers were outraged at first. But Freaky 
Friday worked like magic: “After just one week, both 
executives quickly diagnosed the core issues causing the 
conflict. They then swiftly acted to implement a simple 
set of processes that cleared up the combat and got the 
teams working harmoniously.” From that day forward, 
these two organizations had magnificent .

(A)
Tom was a strong­willed, competitive, hardworking 
businessman, who for thirty years ran a neighborhood 
hardware store. At the age of 58, poor health forced him 
to sell his business. His routine became one of turning 
on the television, pouring a bowl of chips, and spending 
the day in his favorite chair. His friend Don came by to 
see how (a) he was doing. He found his friend gaining 
weight, with a dark complexion and a very bad attitude.
(B)
“Have you gone crazy?” Tom asked, “How is a 
thirteen­year­old going to react to your crazy outfit?” 
“We’ll see,” Don said. At the hospital, Tom helped to 
serve ice cream while (b) he watched his friend do magic 
tricks and talk to patients. He paid special attention to 
Robert, the thirteen­year­old boy who had been active in 
junior high athletics. Don challenged the boy to a game of 
“hangman.” During the entire game, (c) he peppered the 
boy with all kinds of riddles, puns, and jokes. By the 
time he was finished, the boy was smiling happily.
(C)
On the way back to Tom’s house, a thoughtful silence 
enveloped the two men. As they pulled to a stop, Tom 
asked, “How can I get involved?” Two months later, Tom 
and Don were sharing “Hospital Clown” experiences. Tom 
learned that bringing joy and happiness into the hearts of 
patients brought (d) him great rewards. He regained his 
feeling of self­worth and made many new friends. The 
hospital nutritionist taught him better eating habits and 
he lost his unwanted weight. He developed a healthy, 
positive outlook towards the future.
(D)
Don invited Tom to accompany him to visit a 
thirteen­year­old boy in the hospital, who was scheduled 
for surgery the next morning. Reluctantly, Tom accepted 
the invitation. They stopped by Don’s house on the way 
to the hospital. As Tom drank coffee, Don disappeared. 
What emerged minutes later gave (e) him a shock; Don 
was now “Dr. Hick­up,” a hospital clown. Don’s costume 
was composed of an oversized stethoscope, a CD disk 
strapped to his orange wig, and complete clown make­up.
