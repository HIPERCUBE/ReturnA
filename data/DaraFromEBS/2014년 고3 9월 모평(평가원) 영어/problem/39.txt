39. One of the many strengths of the African American 
community is an intrinsic support for the athletic endeavors 
of African American girls and women. ① Since African 
American culture appreciates a greater flexibility of gender 
roles and accepts a broader range of gender-appropriate 
behaviors, African American women are not as bound as 
white women by gender role stereotypes. ② Athletics for 
girls and women is not perceived as conflicting with an African 
American female’s gender role. ③ Hall and Bower’s study 
of African American females found that African American 
women defined themselves as “softly strong”― owning 
both strength and femininity without conflict. ④ African 
American males have played an increasingly important role 
in global politics. ⑤Welcome support from the African 
American community has energized many African American 
girls and women to participate in sports.
