The term objectivity is important in measurement because 
of the scientific demand that observations be subject to 
public verification. A measurement system is objective to 
the extent that two observers (A) evaluate / evaluating the 
same performance arrive at the same (or very similar) 
measurements. For example, using a tape measure to 
determine the distance a javelin (B) threw / was thrown yields 
very similar results regardless of who reads the tape. By 
comparison, evaluation of performances such as diving, 
gymnastics, and figure skating is more subjective ─ although 
elaborate scoring rules help make (C) it / them more objective. 
From the point of view of research in motor behavior, it is 
important to use performances in the laboratory for which 
the scoring can be as objective as possible.
