19. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Everybody has moments of doubt about something or 
other from time to time; it is a natural process. The 
challenge is not to let those moments accumulate and 
affect your self-belief. You will always face the challenge 
of other people’s comments and opinion. There are 
people that you feel good being around and others you 
don’t. Some people give you positive energy because 
they believe in you. You feel it and you rise to the 
occasion. Others may always have a negative comment to 
make about what you are doing or talking about. Don’t 
let these comments rock your self-belief. Always question 
the person’s reason for the comment. If it is based on 
fact, you should listen; if not, then it is only their 
opinion. You will need to stay strong.
* rise to the occasion: 위기 상황에서 능력을 발휘하다
① 인맥이 넓은 사람들과 교제하라.
② 성공하기 위해 도전적인 자세를 가지라.
③ 일시적 감정으로 타인을 비판하지 말라. 
④ 좌절감을 느낄 때는 성공한 경험을 생각하라.
⑤ 선별적인 의견 수용으로 자기 확신이 흔들리지 않게 하라.
20. 다음 글에 드러난 Delia의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Delia stepped out of the front door of her house, and the 
day welcomed her with a warm and sunny smile. With each 
step, she thought, “I can’t wait for today’s class.” Her 
family had recently moved into the neighborhood, and the 
new school year had just begun at Elanova High School. 
Her new school offered ballet lessons, and Delia eagerly 
signed up. She was one step closer to fulfilling her lifelong 
dream of becoming a ballerina. Delia sat at the bench 
waiting for the school bus. As the bus rolled down Madison 
Avenue, she slipped her hand into her ballet bag to touch 
her new shoes. She thought about working hard on her leaps 
and jumps. “I want to soar to the moon,” Delia thought.
① hopeful ② bored ③ relaxed
④ worried ⑤ scared
21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
One reason many people keep delaying things they should 
do is that they fear they will do them wrong or poorly, so 
they just don’t do them at all. For example, one of the best 
ways to write a book is to write it as quickly as possible, 
getting your thoughts onto paper without regard to style. 
Then, you can go back to revise and polish your writing. 
If I only wrote when I knew it would be perfect, I’d still 
be working on my first book! Do you have a hard time 
relaxing if your house is a mess? Do you beat yourself up 
for making mistakes? I’ve got a simple message for you 
today: It’s time to let go of your perfectionism. It becomes 
a stumbling block that keeps you stuck.
① 잦은 실수는 큰 실수를 유발한다.
② 주변을 정리하는 습관이 중요하다.
③ 책을 집필하기 위해서는 인내가 필요하다.
④ 완벽주의는 일을 추진하는 데 방해가 된다.
⑤ 타인의 입장에서 생각하는 것이 바람직하다.
22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Textiles and clothing have functions that go beyond just 
protecting the body. Dress and textiles alike are used as a 
means of nonverbal communication. Obvious examples 
would be the use of uniforms to communicate a particular 
social role and the modern white wedding dress Western 
cultures use to mark this rite of passage. Both types of 
clothing communicate important information nonverbally to 
the onlooker. The female wearing the white dress is about to 
be married and change her status and role in society. The 
person in the uniform has some specialized function in 
society, such as police officer, nurse, or soldier. Therefore, it 
can be said that clothing visually communicates information 
about group membership and functions as an identity marker.
① educational functions of uniforms
② ways to diversify styles of clothing
③ gender differences in choosing clothing
④ different cultural norms of Western society
⑤ 

23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Traditional consumption was not particularly thrifty. The 
concept of thrift emerged out of a more affluent money 
culture. In traditional societies where resources continued to 
be scarce, consumption was more seasonally and 
communally orientated. In years of bountiful crops people 
ate heartily, and in lean years they starved. People were not 
particularly motivated to produce more goods for 
stockpiling, as there was little incentive to do so where 
there was little security from raids. When times were good, 
celebrations of gluttony were held in the winter season 
when stocks could not be refilled. These rituals were more 
important than the potential hardships such celebrations 
might later bring, as they served to bind people together and 
distribute resources. Holiday rituals were typically structured 
around cultural practices such as song, dance, theater, and 
feasting, and took a great deal of time away from work.
* affluent: 풍부한 
** gluttony: 폭식
① What Motivated Traditional Consumption?
② Communal Production of Winter Foods
③ Refilling Stocks: A Survival Necessity
④ How to Survive after a Bad Harvest
⑤ What Constitutes Holiday Rituals?

27. living rock cactus에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Living rock cactus is one of the most peculiar plants 
found in the desert. For most of the year, it blends into 
the rocky limestone soils of the Dead Horse Mountains, 
Mariscal Mountain, and the hills along the Rio Grande. 
You may step on one before you notice it. Spineless and 
flat against the ground, it has triangular tubercles that 
overlap in a star-shaped pattern. In extremely dry conditions, 
living rock cactus is almost invisible: it literally shrinks 
into the surrounding rocky soil. Moisture is stored in the 
root, and during droughts the root shrinks, dragging the 
stem underground. These spineless plants survive by 
blending into their native habitat. As added protection, 
they store foul-tasting, poisonous alkaloids in their bodies.
* limestone: 석회암
** tubercle: 작은 돌기
① 사막에서 발견되는 특이한 식물 중 하나이다.
② 삼각형 모양의 작은 돌기를 가지고 있다. 
③ 매우 건조한 조건에서는 눈에 거의 보이지 않는다.
④ 가뭄 기간에는 뿌리가 팽창한다.
⑤ 독성이 있는 알칼로이드를 체내에 저장한다.

적절한 것은? [3점]
The term objectivity is important in measurement because 
of the scientific demand that observations be subject to 
public verification. A measurement system is objective to 
the extent that two observers (A) evaluate / evaluating the 
same performance arrive at the same (or very similar) 
measurements. For example, using a tape measure to 
determine the distance a javelin (B) threw / was thrown yields 
very similar results regardless of who reads the tape. By 
comparison, evaluation of performances such as diving, 
gymnastics, and figure skating is more subjective ─ although 
elaborate scoring rules help make (C) it / them more objective. 
From the point of view of research in motor behavior, it is 
important to use performances in the laboratory for which 
the scoring can be as objective as possible.
* javelin: 투창
(A) (B) (C)
① evaluate …… threw …… it
② evaluate …… threw …… them
③ evaluating …… threw …… it
④ evaluating …… was thrown …… them
⑤ evaluating …… was thrown …… it
29. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 
않은 것은? [3점]
A special feature of the real estate rental market is its 
tendency to undergo a severe and prolonged contraction 
phase, more so than with manufactured products. When the 
supply of a manufactured product ① exceeds the demand, 
the manufacturer cuts back on output, and the merchant 
reduces inventory to balance supply and demand. 
However, ② property owners cannot reduce the amount 
of space available for rent in their buildings. Space that 
was constructed to accommodate business and consumer 
needs at the peak of the cycle ③ remains, so vacancy 
rates climb and the downward trend becomes more severe. 
Rental rates generally do not drop below a certain point, 
the ④ maximum that must be charged in order to cover 
operating expenses. Some owners will take space off the 
market rather than lose money on it. A few, unable to 
subsidize the property, will sell at distress prices, and 
lenders will repossess others. These may then be placed 
on the market at lower rental rates, further ⑤ depressing 
the market.
* contraction phase: 경기 수축기(후퇴기)
** distress price: 투매 가격(판매자가 손해를 감수하는 매우 싼 가격)

Born in Budapest to a family of bankers, von Neumann 
was undeniably bright. At age eight, ① he had mastered 
calculus. At age twelve, he was reading works aimed at 
professional mathematicians. But ② he also loved to 
invent mechanical toys and became a child expert on 
Byzantine history. When it was time to go off to 
university, he agreed to study chemical engineering as a 
compromise with his father, who feared that ③ his son 
couldn’t make a living as a mathematician. Von Neumann 
kept his bargain by enrolling at the University of 
Budapest and promptly leaving for Berlin, where he spent 
his time doing mathematics, and returning to Budapest at 
the end of every semester to take examinations. He 
published ④ his second mathematics paper, in which he 
gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, at age 
nineteen. By age twenty-five ⑤ he had published ten 
major papers; by age thirty, nearly three dozen.
calculus: 미적분학

31. Not all interesting discoveries have an obvious 
application. If you believe you have something, but 
you’re not sure what exactly it’s going to be good for, 
don’t give up. Many innovations languished in labs for 
years until they were                     . Teflon, an 
extremely slippery synthetic substance employed as a 
coating on cooking utensils, was invented in 1938, but it 
didn’t coat its first pan till 1954. The Post-it note was 
built on the back of some not-very-good glue. Its 
inventor believed it might have value, but it took him 
five years to find a potentially profitable use for it. HP 
had a breakthrough with a super-accurate thermometer 
that was created in the HP Labs. Despite its accuracy, 
there was no clear use for the device until it was used to 
measure fluctuations in ocean temperature. [3점]
* languish: 시들해지다
① replaced by new ones
② matched to a product
③ backed up by a theory
④ found to be eco-friendly
⑤ tested for their accuracy
32. Empathy is a character trait that we value in ourselves 
and in our friends, colleagues, and the professionals who 
serve us. The know-how to be empathetic is central to 
practical wisdom: unless we can understand how others 
think and feel, it’s difficult to know the right thing to do. 
But empathy has its dark side: too much understanding and 
sensitivity, too much seeing things from the other’s 
perspective, can                                        . 
Edmund Pellegrino, a scholar of bioethics, explains it like 
this: “If a physician identifies too closely as co-sufferer 
with the patient, she loses the objectivity essential to the 
most precise assessment of what is wrong, of what can be 
done, and of what should be done to meet those needs. 
Excessive co-suffering also impedes and may even 
paralyze the physician into a state of inaction.”
* impede: 방해하다
① block everlasting friendship
② justify doctors’ abuse of power
③ cloud judgment and paralyze choice
④ lead to a hasty but correct diagnosis
⑤ decrease doctors’ compassion for patients
33. Bees have their choice of flora according to color. 
Lord Avenbury once made an experiment to see if the 
color of flowers attracted bees. Placing honey on slips of 
paper of different shades, he found that the insects which 
visited them seemed to have a marked preference for 
blue, after which came white, yellow, red, green and 
orange. This finding should be considered for our 
beekeeping planning. If pollination is the prime 
consideration of taming bees and if the crop is identified,  
while planning. 
Let us consider beekeeping near a mustard field. Mustard 
gives tiny yellow flowers full of nectar and pollen. For 
better yield of mustard seeds, pollination is necessary. 
But if there is plenty of blue-colored wild flora nearby, 
bees may prefer the blue flowers to mustard. Although 
we shall get honey and other products, the objective for 
pollination of mustard may be defeated. [3점]
* flora: 식물군
① bees’ preference for color should be put aside
② a greater harvest can be expected near blue flora
③ the quality of honey should be taken into account
④ the abundance of blue flora nearby must be ensured
⑤ the color of other floras nearby should be considered
34. In the mid-1900s, John Kenneth Galbraith shocked the 
field of economics when he insisted that consumers do 
not merely participate in the marketplace, they are also 
the product of the systematic deployment of power 
throughout society. Within this deployment of power, 
commercial media ensures that consumers adopt values 
and beliefs that match the general requirements of the 
economy. The individual’s participation in mass behavior 
patterns is                                   .  
Consumers engage in shared patterns of consumption 
because they live within an economic system that 
operates as a belief system. It exercises considerable 
control over the meaning and value of things. When the 
economy functions as a belief system, it establishes 
severe limits on a consumer’s free choice. As consumers, 
our choices are not entirely our own. Our beliefs, values, 
thoughts, and emotions are highly conditioned to match 
the needs of the marketplace. [3점]
* deployment: 배치
① not driven by commercial media’s agenda
② a product of unconditioned personal choice
③ not a spontaneous reaction to random forces
④ not affected by the needs of the marketplace
⑤ an outcome irrelevant to the economic system

35. 주어진 글 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 것은?
We’ve all heard the phrase “the family that plays 
together, stays together.” The wisdom in this phrase is 
that social play builds ties between people that are 
lasting and consequential. 
(A) In crying out, the danger-spotting squirrel draws 
attention to itself, which may well attract the 
predator. Scientists used to think that animals would 
risk their lives like this only for kin with whom they 
shared common genes. 
(B) This wisdom holds outside the human family circle 
as well. For example, when one ground squirrel sees 
a predator in the distance, it will sound an alarm call 
that alerts other squirrels to run for cover. It’s a 
risky move.
(C) New evidence suggests, however, that squirrels also 
sound alarm calls for former playmates, not genetically 
related. These squirrels developed a social resource 
while playing― and these buddies will put their lives 
on the line to save their playmates.

The study also revealed the commanders had given 
more attention and praise to the crew members for 
whom they had the higher expectations. 
Self-fulfilling prophecies can have a positive side. ( ① ) 
We know that students introduced to their teachers as 
“intellectual bloomers” often do better on achievement 
tests than do their counterparts who lack such a positive 
introduction. ( ② ) In a study of army tank crews, one 
set of tank commanders was told that some members of 
their assigned crews had exceptional abilities while others 
were only average. ( ③ ) In reality, the crew members 
had been assigned randomly so that the two test groups 
were equal in ability. ( ④ ) The commanders later 
reported that the so-called “exceptional” crew members 
performed better than the “average” ones. ( ⑤ ) The 
self-fulfilling effects in these cases strongly suggest that 
managers adopt positive and optimistic approaches toward 
others at work.

But neither are aware of this fact when it comes to 
unmarked crosswalks. 
Studies do show that motorists are more likely to yield 
to pedestrians in marked crosswalks than at unmarked 
crosswalks. But as some researchers found, that does not 
necessarily make things safer. ( ① ) When they compared 
the way pedestrians crossed at both kinds of crosswalks 
on roads with considerable traffic volumes, they found that 
people at unmarked crosswalks tended to look both ways 
more often, waited more often for gaps in traffic, and 
crossed the road more quickly. ( ② ) Researchers suspect 
that both drivers and pedestrians are more aware that 
drivers should yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks. 
( ③ ) Not knowing traffic safety laws, it turns out, is 
actually a good thing for pedestrians. ( ④ ) Because they 
do not know whether cars are supposed to stop, they act 
more cautiously. ( ⑤ ) Marked crosswalks, by contrast, 
may give pedestrians an unrealistic picture of their own 
safety. [3점]

38. Some researchers investigated the effects of different 
media on children’s ability to produce imaginative responses. 
In one study, children in grades one through four were 
separated randomly into two groups and presented with 
the same fictional story. One group listened to the story 
via radio, while the other group watched the story on a 
television. ① Afterward, all of the children were asked 
what they thought would happen next in the story. ② The 
researchers rated children’s imaginativeness by recording 
the novel elements (such as characters, setting, dialogue, 
and feelings) they used in their responses. ③ Some 
novelists prefer to include as many characters as possible 
in their stories. ④ The children who listened to the radio 
produced more imaginative responses, whereas the children 
who watched the television produced more words that 
repeated the original story. ⑤ Media scholars have used 
this study to illustrate the “visualization hypothesis,” which 
states that children’s exposure to ready-made visual images 
restricts their ability to generate novel images of their own.

39. One of the many strengths of the African American 
community is an intrinsic support for the athletic endeavors 
of African American girls and women. ① Since African 
American culture appreciates a greater flexibility of gender 
roles and accepts a broader range of gender-appropriate 
behaviors, African American women are not as bound as 
white women by gender role stereotypes. ② Athletics for 
girls and women is not perceived as conflicting with an African 
American female’s gender role. ③ Hall and Bower’s study 
of African American females found that African American 
women defined themselves as “softly strong”― owning 
both strength and femininity without conflict. ④ African 
American males have played an increasingly important role 
in global politics. ⑤Welcome support from the African 
American community has energized many African American 
girls and women to participate in sports.

Experts have found that reading classical texts benefits 
the mind by catching the reader’s attention and triggering 
moments of self-reflection. The brain activity of volunteers 
was monitored as they read classical works. These same 
texts were then “translated” into more straightforward, 
modern language and again the readers’ brains were 
monitored as they read the words. Scans showed that the 
more challenging prose and poetry set off far more 
electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian 
versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as 
it responded to each word and record how it lit up as the 
readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or 
difficult sentence structures. This lighting up lasts long 
enough to shift the brain into a higher gear, encouraging 
further reading. The research also found that reading the 
more challenging version of poetry, in particular, increases 
activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the 
readers to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences 
in light of what they have read. The academics said this 
meant the classics were more useful than self-help books.
󰀻

Organisms must compete for resources not only with 
members of their own species, but with members of 
other species. When two species use the same resource 
and the resource is scarce, the species must compete just 
as if they were members of the same population. One 
of the two species usually turns out to be better at the 
competition. If two species eat exactly the same food, for 
example, one of the two will be better at catching it. 
Unless something interferes, the inferior competitor loses 
out and the competitively superior species takes over. 
When one species eliminates another by outcompeting it, 
it is called competitive exclusion.
Sometimes a competitively superior species is prevented 
from excluding poorer competitors. Periodic disturbances 
such as severe storms, battering by drifting logs, or 
underwater landslides can reduce the population of a 
dominant competitor and give other species a chance. 
Furthermore, which species is competitively superior 
sometimes depends on the conditions. On rocky shores 
in tropical Hong Kong, for example, foliose (leaf-like) 
algae are the dominant seaweeds during the relatively 
cool winter. In the summer heat, these forms die out 
and are replaced by more resistant encrusting algae. 
Seasonal variation thus prevents either group from 
excluding the other, and there is a  
between the competing species.

(A)
Jim Nelson, a junior at Manti High School, was an 
outstanding athlete. He had just made the school 
basketball team, one of the best in the state. But on 
October 23, 1996, most of (a) his athletic future was 
suddenly taken away from him. Jim was riding his 
bicycle at night to visit his friend. The road was very 
steep in some places. It was very dark and difficult to see.

(B)
Because of his injury, Jim wasn’t able to play on the 
basketball team during the rest of that year, but the 
coach did make him equipment manager so that he 
could come and practice. All summer long in 1997, each 
and every night, (b) he practiced making left-handed 
baskets. When the next season arrived, Jim was ready to 
try out for the team― and he made it again!
(C)
As he came around a sloping curve on his bicycle, Jim 
hit a car parked on the side of the road. (c) He ended 
up in the hospital. Besides bad cuts on his head, he 
broke his right arm and was in a cast for two months. 
Jim’s doctor gave him a series of tests. The doctor 
concluded that (d) he had suffered nerve damage and 
that he might never regain the full use of his right arm.
(D)
Jim never became a starter, but he was always the 
first substitute to go in the game. Jim got a chance to 
play in the last 30 seconds of the championship game 
when a starting player sprained (e) his ankle. With 10 
seconds left, Jim balanced the ball in his left hand and 
took the shot. The crowd was deathly quiet until―
swish! He made the three-point-shot left-handed! Jim 
won not only the game but also the hearts of his 
teammates for proving that with determination, no 
obstacle is too great.
