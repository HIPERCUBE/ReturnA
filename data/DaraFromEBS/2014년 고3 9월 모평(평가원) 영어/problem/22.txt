Textiles and clothing have functions that go beyond just 
protecting the body. Dress and textiles alike are used as a 
means of nonverbal communication. Obvious examples 
would be the use of uniforms to communicate a particular 
social role and the modern white wedding dress Western 
cultures use to mark this rite of passage. Both types of 
clothing communicate important information nonverbally to 
the onlooker. The female wearing the white dress is about to 
be married and change her status and role in society. The 
person in the uniform has some specialized function in 
society, such as police officer, nurse, or soldier. Therefore, it 
can be said that clothing visually communicates information 
about group membership and functions as an identity marker.
