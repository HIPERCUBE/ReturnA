Traditional consumption was not particularly thrifty. The 
concept of thrift emerged out of a more affluent money 
culture. In traditional societies where resources continued to 
be scarce, consumption was more seasonally and 
communally orientated. In years of bountiful crops people 
ate heartily, and in lean years they starved. People were not 
particularly motivated to produce more goods for 
stockpiling, as there was little incentive to do so where 
there was little security from raids. When times were good, 
celebrations of gluttony were held in the winter season 
when stocks could not be refilled. These rituals were more 
important than the potential hardships such celebrations 
might later bring, as they served to bind people together and 
distribute resources. Holiday rituals were typically structured 
around cultural practices such as song, dance, theater, and 
feasting, and took a great deal of time away from work.
