31. Not all interesting discoveries have an obvious 
application. If you believe you have something, but 
you’re not sure what exactly it’s going to be good for, 
don’t give up. Many innovations languished in labs for 
years until they were                     . Teflon, an 
extremely slippery synthetic substance employed as a 
coating on cooking utensils, was invented in 1938, but it 
didn’t coat its first pan till 1954. The Post-it note was 
built on the back of some not-very-good glue. Its 
inventor believed it might have value, but it took him 
five years to find a potentially profitable use for it. HP 
had a breakthrough with a super-accurate thermometer 
that was created in the HP Labs. Despite its accuracy, 
there was no clear use for the device until it was used to 
measure fluctuations in ocean temperature. [3점]
