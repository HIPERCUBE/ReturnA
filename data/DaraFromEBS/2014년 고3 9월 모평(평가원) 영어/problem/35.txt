We’ve all heard the phrase “the family that plays 
together, stays together.” The wisdom in this phrase is 
that social play builds ties between people that are 
lasting and consequential. 
(A) In crying out, the danger-spotting squirrel draws 
attention to itself, which may well attract the 
predator. Scientists used to think that animals would 
risk their lives like this only for kin with whom they 
shared common genes. 
(B) This wisdom holds outside the human family circle 
as well. For example, when one ground squirrel sees 
a predator in the distance, it will sound an alarm call 
that alerts other squirrels to run for cover. It’s a 
risky move.
(C) New evidence suggests, however, that squirrels also 
sound alarm calls for former playmates, not genetically 
related. These squirrels developed a social resource 
while playing― and these buddies will put their lives 
on the line to save their playmates.
