Organisms must compete for resources not only with 
members of their own species, but with members of 
other species. When two species use the same resource 
and the resource is scarce, the species must compete just 
as if they were members of the same population. One 
of the two species usually turns out to be better at the 
competition. If two species eat exactly the same food, for 
example, one of the two will be better at catching it. 
Unless something interferes, the inferior competitor loses 
out and the competitively superior species takes over. 
When one species eliminates another by outcompeting it, 
it is called competitive exclusion.
Sometimes a competitively superior species is prevented 
from excluding poorer competitors. Periodic disturbances 
such as severe storms, battering by drifting logs, or 
underwater landslides can reduce the population of a 
dominant competitor and give other species a chance. 
Furthermore, which species is competitively superior 
sometimes depends on the conditions. On rocky shores 
in tropical Hong Kong, for example, foliose (leaf-like) 
algae are the dominant seaweeds during the relatively 
cool winter. In the summer heat, these forms die out 
and are replaced by more resistant encrusting algae. 
Seasonal variation thus prevents either group from 
excluding the other, and there is a  
between the competing species.
