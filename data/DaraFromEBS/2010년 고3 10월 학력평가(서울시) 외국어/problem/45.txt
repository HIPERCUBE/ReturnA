Sometimes anonymity in traffic acts as a powerful drug,
with several curious side effects. No one is watching and
no one we know will see us, and the inside of the car
itself becomes a useful place for self‒expression. This
may explain why most people, given the choice, desire a
minimum commute of at least twenty minutes. Drivers
desire this lonely “me time” ― to sing, to feel like a
teenager again, to be temporarily free from the
constricted roles of work and home. One study found that
the car was a favored place for people to cry about
something. According to another study, researchers
installed cameras inside of cars to study drivers. They
report that after only a short time, drivers will “forget
the camera” and begin to do all sorts of things, including
nose picking.
