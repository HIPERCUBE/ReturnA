Karyenda, a traditional drum of Burundi, is much more
than just a simple musical instrument. In earlier times, it
was considered such a sacred object that the king
interpreted the messages of the beatings of the Karyenda
and turned them into rules for the kingdom. Major events
for the king were announced through the drums, such as
royal coronations, funerals, and weddings. The drums were
normally kept in drum sanctuaries which were guarded
mainly by Hutu families, and they alone, with the king’s
consent, were allowed to manufacture, play, and keep the
drums. When Burundi gained independence from Belgium in
1962, the Karyenda was the symbol for the national flag. It
was later replaced with three stars after the Republic of
Burundi was established. * coronation: 즉위식
