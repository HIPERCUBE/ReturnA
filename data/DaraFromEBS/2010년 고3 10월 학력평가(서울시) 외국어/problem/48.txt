According to a study, the average hotel maid cleans
fifteen rooms a day, and each room takes about thirty
minutes to complete. The maids are walking, bending,
pushing, lifting, carrying, scrubbing, and dusting. What
they’re doing, in short, is exercising. In fact, they are
dramatically exceeding the daily doses of exercise
recommended by health experts. But the maids don’t seem
to recognize what they’re doing as exercise. At the
beginning of the study, sixty‒seven percent of the maids
reported that they didn’t exercise regularly. Then, what is
“exercise”? If we accept the cultural definition of exercise
as something we do on a treadmill in a fitness club, then
the maids’ responses are correct. But our bodies don’t
make a distinction about — a calorie
burned is a calorie burned.
The researchers were curious about what would happen
if the maids were told that they were actually exercising.
One group of maids were told about the benefits of
exercise, and they were told that their daily work was
sufficient to get those benefits. Meanwhile, maids in
another group were also told about the benefits of
exercise, but they weren’t told that their own work was a
good form of exercise. Four weeks later, the maids who
had been told that they were good exercisers had lost an
average of 1.8 pounds. The other maids hadn’t lost any
weight.
