Jeannette Rankin was born in Missoula, Montana in 1880. 
After attending public schools in Missoula, Jeannette 
majored in biology at the University of Montana and 
graduated in 1902. Jeannette became the first woman 
elected to the U.S. Congress in 1916, before women 
nationwide had the right to vote. In 1917, she became one 
of 49 members of Congress who voted against entry into 
World War I. In 1941, she was the only legislator to vote 
against entry into World War II. The vote effectively ended 
her political career. In 1943, Jeannette went back to 
Montana rather than run for Congress again. She traveled 
worldwide, including to India and Turkey, promoting peace. 
Her long career was distinguished by her deep commitment 
to the country’s women, poor, and children. She continued 
to participate in antiwar movements actively by attending 
rallies and giving speeches into her 90’s.
