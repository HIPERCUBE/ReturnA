The above graph shows the total U.S. primary energy 
production in 2011 and the percentage each energy source 
accounts for. ① The pie chart shows five different energy 
sources: natural gas, coal, petroleum, nuclear, and 
renewables, with the last of these divided into six further 
sub‒categories. ② The percentage of natural gas, coal, and 
petroleum in total takes up more than two thirds of the total 
U.S. primary energy production. ③ The data also reveals that 
nuclear power generation ranks last and is close behind 
renewables with a marginal difference of one percentage 
point. ④ In the category of renewable energy, biofuels and 
other biomass percentages combined are larger than half of 
the renewable energy produced while hydroelectric energy is 
the single largest source. ⑤ Meanwhile, the two lowest 
renewables, geothermal and solar, share the same percentage 
of two percent each.
