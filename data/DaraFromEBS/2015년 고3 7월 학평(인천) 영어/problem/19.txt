her. Silent and somewhat still, she stood on the changing 
table as I held her close to zip her up. I breathed in the 
clean smell of her hair, feeling blonde curls tickle my chin.

each other for a few seconds, my daughter standing on the 
changing table dressed in her fuzzy red sleeper, her arms 
around my neck, her cheek pressed to my left shoulder. 
“Oh, Lucy,” I whispered, my words tight with tears. I never 
wanted to let go.
