It has been proposed that sleep functions to conserve 
energy. This may be particularly relevant for warm‒blooded 
animals (mammals and birds) that must expend a lot of 
energy to maintain a body temperature higher than ① that of 
their surroundings. Indeed, many small mammals living in 
cold climates, who lose heat easily by having an 
unfavorable surface area to body weight ratio, ② tending 
to sleep a lot, often in insulating burrows. Yet sleep does 
not appear ③ to have evolved only in warm‒blooded animals. 
Some studies on reptiles and amphibians indicate that they 
also sleep, and there are now strong indications of a sleep
‒like state in some invertebrates, such as crayfish, fruit 
flies, and honey bees. Also, though it is true that the overall 
use of energy is reduced during sleep, as ④ compared with 
the active waking state, there is almost as much reduction 
in energy use from just resting quietly. The additional 
energy conservation in going from the resting state to sleep 
⑤ is minimal.                        * invertebrate: 무척추동물
