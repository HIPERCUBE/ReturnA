Looking at nature is another activity that gives our 
directed attention a chance to recover.  
“We have two kinds of attention,” says Andrea Faber 
Taylor, an environmental psychologist at the University of 
Illinois. The first is the “directed attention” we call on for 
tasks that require focus, like driving or doing our taxes.  
( ① ) Directed attention tends to be tiring, however, and 
fatigue affects our ability to make good decisions and 
control destructive impulses. ( ② ) The best way to restore 
directed attention is to give it a rest by shifting to the 
second type, “involuntary attention,” which we display when 
we meditate. ( ③ ) For example, Roger Ulrich at Texas A&M 
University found that people who commuted along scenic 
roads recovered more quickly from stressful driving 
conditions than those who saw billboards, buildings, and 
parking lots. ( ④ ) Ulrich also looked at patients recovering 
from surgery. ( ⑤ ) The patients who could see trees from 
their hospital beds needed fewer painkillers and had shorter 
hospital stays than those who looked out on brick walls.
