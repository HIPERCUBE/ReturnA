(A)
The little country schoolhouse was heated by an old‒
fashioned coal stove. An eight‒year‒old boy named Glenn 
and (a) his older brother had the job of coming to school 
early each day so that they could use kerosene to start the 
fire and warm the classroom. One cold morning someone 
mistakenly filled the kerosene container they used with 
gasoline, and disaster struck. The fire killed Glenn’s brother 
and badly burned Glenn’s legs.               * kerosene: 등유
 (B)
For two months, the parents and the doctor debated on 
whether to amputate. They used this time to instill in Glenn 
the belief that (b) he would someday walk again. They never 
amputated Glenn’s legs, but when the bandages were finally 
removed, it was discovered that his right leg was almost 
three inches shorter than the other. The toes on his left foot 
were almost completely burned off. Yet Glenn was fiercely 
determined. Though in unbearable pain, he forced himself to 
exercise daily and finally took a few painful steps.          
** amputate: (손이나 발을) 절단하다
(C)
Slowly recovering, Glenn finally threw away his crutches 
and began to walk almost normally. Soon he was running. 
This determined young man kept running and running and 
running― and those legs that came so close to being 
amputated carried (c) him to a world record in the mile run. 
His full name? Glenn Cunningham, who was known as the 
“World’s Fastest Human Being,” and was named athlete of 
the century at Madison Square Garden.  
(D)
The doctor attending Glenn recommended amputating his 
legs. His parents were devastated. They had already lost 
one son, and now their other son was to lose (d) his legs. 
However, they did not lose their faith. They did not 
consent to what the doctor suggested, either. Each day they 
asked (e) him for a delay, praying that their son’s legs 
would somehow heal and he would become well again.
