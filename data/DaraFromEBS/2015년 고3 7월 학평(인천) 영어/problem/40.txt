New York University psychologist Gabriele Oettingen 
studied women enrolled in a weight‒reduction program 
trying to lose a few pounds. In the study, the 
participants used positive thinking ― imagining themselves 
reaching their goals ― as a motivator. The results weren’t 
so positive. “A year later, I checked in on these women 
from the weight‒loss study,” Oettingen writes in the New 
York Times, and “the more positively women had 
imagined themselves in these scenarios, the fewer pounds 
they had lost.” As the above study and others of 
Oettingen’s found, positive thinking makes people feel 
comfortable with their present state. Too comfortable. 
Dreaming of the future “can drain you of the energy you 
need to take action in pursuit of your goals,” she says.   “Positive thinking fools our minds into perceiving that 
we’ve already attained our goal, slackening our readiness 
to pursue it.”
