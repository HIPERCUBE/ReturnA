Linda was planning to visit Amy in a distant city, but 
shortly before she was supposed to arrive, Linda called 
and canceled. Although Amy felt disappointed, she tried to 
be understanding. Being polite by not imposing, and 
respecting Linda’s need for independence, Amy said it was 
really okay if Linda didn’t come. Linda was very 
depressed at that time, and she got more depressed. She 
took Amy’s considerateness as indifference. Amy later felt 
partly responsible for Linda’s depression because she 
hadn’t insisted that Linda visit. This confusion was easy 
to fall into and hard to climb out of because ways of 
showing caring and indifference are inherently ambiguous. 
You can be nice to someone either by showing your 
involvement or by not imposing. And you can be mean by 
refusing to show involvement ― cutting her off ― or by 
imposing ― being “inconsiderate.” You can show someone 
you are angry by shouting at her or refusing to talk to 
her at all. You can be kind by saying something or by 
saying nothing. For example, if someone has suffered a 
misfortune ― failed an exam, lost a job, or contracted a 
disease ― you may show sympathy by expressing your 
concern in words or by deliberately not mentioning it to 
avoid causing pain by bringing it up. If everyone takes the 
latter approach,              becomes a chamber in which 
the ill, the bereaved and the unemployed are isolated.
