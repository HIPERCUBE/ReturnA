The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most 
pronounced where emotions are involved. The psychologist 
Paul Slovic has proposed a theory in which people let their 
likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world. 
Your political ① preference determines the arguments that 
you find compelling. If you like the current health policy, you 
believe its benefits are substantial and its costs ② more 
manageable than the costs of alternatives. If you are a hawk 
in your attitude toward other nations, you probably think they 
are relatively weak and likely to ③ submit to your country’s 
will. If you are a dove, you probably think they are strong 
and will not be easily persuaded. Your emotional attitude to 
such things as red meat, nuclear power, tattoos, or 
motorcycles ④ follows your beliefs about their benefits and 
their risks. If you ⑤ dislike any of these things, you probably 
believe that its risks are high and its benefits negligible.
