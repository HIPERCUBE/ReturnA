A female lawyer working for a prestigious New York 
law firm once accompanied the male CEO of a major 
client to Latin America to negotiate a complex deal.
(A) It was the local practice, the colleague suggested, for lawyers to negotiate only with other lawyers, not with 
the businesspeople. Had the woman lawyer insisted on 
participating, she would have spoiled the deal and 
destroyed her credibility.
(B) Before voicing her objections, however, she called a 
colleague back in New York, who told her that he, too, 
had been excluded from preliminary talks during his last 
negotiation in that country. The Latin American 
executive was just looking for a diplomatic way to get 
her out of the picture as a lawyer, not as a woman.
(C) Soon after they arrived, the head of the prospective 
Latin American partner suggested that he and the CEO 
go off together to discuss business ― while his wife and 
the lawyer go shopping. The lawyer was outraged, 
assuming this to be an example of Latin American 
gender bias.
