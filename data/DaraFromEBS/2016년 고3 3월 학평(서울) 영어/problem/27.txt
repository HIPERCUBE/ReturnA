Carlos Sanchez’s long­time friend, Frank Sandoval, had 
fallen on hard times and was about to lose ① his home. 
Frank’s wife was sick and their two small children were 
temporarily staying with his mother. Carlos hadn’t talked to 
Frank for several months and decided one day to call him 
and see how ② he was. When Frank confided in Carlos 
about his situation, Carlos immediately went to Frank’s 
home. When he walked in, ③ he was shocked to see his 
friend so thin and frail. He sat down with Frank and asked 
him how much money ④ he needed. Frank told him it was 
hopeless, that it was too much to pay back. Carlos pulled 
out his checkbook and wrote ⑤ him a check for fifty 
thousand dollars. He told Frank that things would get better
― and they did. Three years later, Frank paid Carlos back 
with interest.
