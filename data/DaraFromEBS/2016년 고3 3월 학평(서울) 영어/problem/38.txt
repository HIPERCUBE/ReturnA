However, during the same period, there has been no 
comparable worldwide advance in ethical behavior.
Over the past century, society has witnessed 
extraordinary advances in medicine, science, and technology. 
( ① ) These advances came about because an individual, or 
many individuals, used the full resources of his or her 
intellectual imagination to solve problems that had previously 
been thought to be unsolvable. ( ② ) That is, in part, 
because human beings rarely use the full resources of their 
intellect to solve moral problems. ( ③ ) Exercising moral 
imagination means using our intelligence to devise creative 
and innovative ways to help others. ( ④ ) Concerning 
charity, for example, it means not only providing immediate 
assistance to the impoverished, but also helping the poor in 
ways that will enable them to support themselves and no 
longer need help. ( ⑤ ) Therefore, in any situation in 
which help is required, we should use our intelligence to 
discover the most effective and loving way to help those in 
need. [3점]
