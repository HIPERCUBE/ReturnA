There are two main strategies we can adopt to improve 
the quality of life. The first is to try making external 
conditions match our goals. The second is to change how 
we experience external conditions to make them fit our 
goals better.      (A)     , feeling secure is an important 
component of happiness. The sense of security can be 
improved by installing strong locks on the front door, 
moving to a safer neighborhood, or exerting political 
pressure on city hall for more police protection. All these 
different responses are aimed at bringing conditions in the 
environment more in line with our goals.      (B)     , we 
can feel more secure by modifying our definition of 
security. If one does not expect perfect safety, recognizes 
that risks are inevitable, and succeeds in enjoying a less 
than ideally predictable world, the threat of insecurity will not have as great a chance of spoiling happiness.
