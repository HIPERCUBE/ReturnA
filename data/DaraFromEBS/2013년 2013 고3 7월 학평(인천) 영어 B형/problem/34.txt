34. Let’s think about flipping a coin. If you get ten heads in 
a row, what is the likelihood that the next flip will be 
heads? Don’t be fooled ― it’s 50 percent, the same as it is 
on any single coin flip. Most people think the chances of 
getting heads will actually be lower than 50 percent ― the 
opposite of momentum. They know they should see roughly 
the same number of heads as tails (50-50), so they feel 
that if they have seen ten heads in a row, they are due for 
a tails. A tails has to emerge. But it doesn’t. There is no 
law of averages. If the process is random, there is no 
predictability. This is also what drives the “gambler’s 
fallacy.” Gamblers on losing streaks erroneously believe they 
are due for a win and keep gambling, thinking that their luck  
. But if the whole thing is random, you 
aren’t due for anything. Your chances haven’t changed at all.
