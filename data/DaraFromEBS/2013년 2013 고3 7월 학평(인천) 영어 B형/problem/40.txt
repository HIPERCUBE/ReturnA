Drawing a line is making a distinction between two 
categories which only differ in degree. Where there is a 
continuum, such as that between rich and poor, for some 
purposes, such as deciding who should be eligible for tax 
relief, it is necessary to draw a line between what is to 
count as rich and what as poor. Sometimes the fact that a 
line could have been drawn elsewhere is taken as 
evidence that we should not draw a line at all, or that the 
line that has been drawn has no force; in most contexts 
this view is wrong. For example, in Britain the speed limit 
in built­up areas is 30 miles per hour (mph); it could 
have been fixed at 25 mph or 35 mph. However, it in no 
way follows from this that we should ignore the speed 
limit, once the line between speeding and driving safely 
has been set.
