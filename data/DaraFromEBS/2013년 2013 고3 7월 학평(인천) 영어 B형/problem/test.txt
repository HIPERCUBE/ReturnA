23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? 
One of the key fears we all have is fear that this is the 
wrong time to start whatever our project is, and we should 
wait until the “time is right.” Tim Ferriss, author of the 
bestselling book The 4­Hour Workweek, has this to say 
about timing: “For all the most important things, the timing 
is always wrong. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? 
The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will 
never all be green at the same time. Conditions are never 
perfect. ‘Someday’ is a disease that will take your dreams to 
the grave with you. If it’s important to you and you want to 
do it ‘eventually,’ just do it and correct course along the 
way.” If you wait for the timing to be right before you make 
a move, you may never make a move at all. 
① 원하는 일은 때를 기다리지 말고 바로 실행하라.
② 꿈을 실현하기 위한 구체적인 계획을 세워라.
③ 결과보다는 노력의 과정에 의미를 부여하라.
④ 성공을 위해 일의 우선순위를 정하라.
⑤ 과거의 실패에 얽매이지 마라.
24. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은? 
The biggest game­changer in our future is life 
prolongation. It works for mice and worms, and surely it 
will work for the rest of us some day. Biologists are now 
tinkering with so­called anti­aging substances, trying to get 
you the benefit of life prolongation. But, life gets its edge 
from the possibility of its ending. What will life be like 
when we live forever? No one dies. No one gets older. No 
more evolution. No need to hurry. If you want something 
done, give it to a busy man, but nobody needs to be busy 
when you have forever. Who is going to do the real work, 
then? Chosen people who will volunteer or be volunteered to 
be mortal. Life without death changes absolutely everything. 
If we want things to stay as they are, then things will have 
to change. 

① Life driven by purpose is meaningful.
② Life extension is not a shift for the better.
③ Pursuing eternity is the nature of humanity.
④ The working population will decrease in the future. 
⑤ Living slowly and selflessly makes you stay young.
25. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
In Western culture, playing the masculine role has 
traditionally required traits such as independence, assertiveness, 
and dominance. Females are expected to be more nurturing and 
sensitive to other people. Are these masculine and feminine 
roles universal? Could biological differences between the sexes 
lead inevitably to gender differences in behavior? In 1935, 
anthropologist Margaret Mead compared the gender roles 
adopted by people in three tribal societies on the island of 
New Guinea, and her observations are certainly 
thought­provoking. In the Arapesh tribe, both men and women 
were taught to play what we would regard as a feminine role: 
They were cooperative, non­aggressive, and sensitive to the 
needs of others. Both men and women of the Mundugumor 
tribe were brought up to be aggressive and emotionally 
unresponsive to other people ─ a masculine pattern of behavior 
by Western standards. Finally, the Tchambuli tribe displayed a 
pattern of gender­role development that was the direct 
opposite of the Western pattern: Males were passive, 
emotionally dependent, and socially sensitive, whereas females 
were dominant, independent, and assertive.

In college, McCormack was a pretty amazing golfer. One 
day, ① he had the good fortune to play against future golfing 
legend Arnold Palmer. After ② his collegiate golf days, 
McCormack got a law degree, and his friend Palmer turned 
to him for legal advice. At the time, athletes were not the 
constant presence in pop culture and advertising as they are 
today. But McCormack noticed that professional athletes were 
like actors. And ③ he recognized that they had adoring fans 
who wanted to meet them in person and, possibly, use the 
products they used. As a lawyer, ④ he understood how 
agencies helped get endorsements for their actors. Using that 
model, he arranged for Palmer to play golf with heads of 
companies to connect ⑤ his image with products just like 
actors did. Before long, Palmer’s income jumped. Other 
golfers signed on, and McCormack created IMG, the first 
major sports management agency.

William H. Whyte turned video cameras on a number of 
spaces in New York City, watching to see ① how people used 
the spaces. He made a number of fascinating findings, and he 
had the video evidence to back ② them up. Even in the 
crowded city, he found that many urban spaces were usually 
deserted; people flocked to a few busy plazas even when they 
were planning to sit alone. Why? The most common activity 
among people observed by Whyte ③ turning out to be 
watching other people. And it was also found that people 
liked to be watched! Whyte expected lovers to ④ be found in 
private, isolated spaces, but most often they sat or stood 
right in the center of things for everyone to see. Further, 
people having private conversations would stand in the middle 
of the sidewalk, forcing people ⑤ to step around them.

The decline in manufacturing will inevitably bring about a 
new protectionism. The first reaction to a period of 
turbulence is to try to build a wall that ① shields one’s own 
garden from the cold winds outside. But such walls no longer 
protect businesses that do not meet world standards. It will 
only make them more ② prosperous. The best example is 
Mexico, which had a deliberate policy of building its domestic 
economy ③ independent of the outside world. It did this not 
only by building high walls of protectionism to keep foreign 
competition out, but by practically forbidding its own 
companies to export. This attempt to create a purely 
Mexican economy ④ failed. Mexico actually became 
increasingly dependent on imports from other countries. It 
was finally ⑤ obliged to open itself to the outside world.

The above graph shows the number of patent applications 
from China, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the 
European Patent Office from 1990 to 2011. ① Between 1990 
and 2005, Japan had the largest number of patent applications 
while the United States had the second largest. ② However, 
the United States overtook Japan in 2006, and had more than 
400,000 patent applications. ③ The combined number of 
patent applications in South Korea and the European Patent 
Office in 2011 was larger than the number of patent 
applications in the United States in the same year. ④ While  
the European Patent Office had the third largest number of 
patent applications in 1990, it had the least number of 
patent applications in 2011. ⑤ What is noticeable is that the 
number of patent applications in China soared dramatically 
from 2003 to 2011, surpassing that of the United States in 
2011.   
30. saffron에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Without question saffron is the most expensive spice in 
the world. Out of 100,000 to 250,000 handpicked plants, one 
pound of saffron is yielded. First found in the Near East in 
Asia Minor, it was used by the Persians as both a flavor 
enhancer and dye. The blue­violet and lily shaped flowers of 
the plant appear in autumn. At the center of these flowers 
are three blood­red stigmas, which are the saffron threads 
that form the spice. It is better to buy the stigma rather 
than powdered saffron because the powder may be already 
mixed with other ingredients. Very little should be used, not 
only because of the expense, but because too much can emit 
a medicinal taste. In Indian cooking it is used in pilafs and 
biryani dishes. Saffron is also found on the foreheads of 
Indian women denoting their social class.

31. The relationship between physical products and individual 
ownership is undergoing a profound evolution. We don’t want 
the CD; we want the music it plays. We don’t want the disc; 
we want the storage it holds. We don’t want the answering 
machine; we want the messages it saves. We don’t want the 
DVD; we want the movie it carries. In other words, we want 
not the stuff but the needs or experiences it fulfills. As our 
possessions “dematerialize” into the intangible, our 
preconceptions of ownership are changing, creating a dotted 
line between “what’s mine,” “what’s yours,” and “what’s 
ours.” This shift is fueling a world where             has 
more value than possession, and as Kevin Kelly, a founder of 
Wired magazine, puts it, where “access is better than 
ownership.”

32. Scientists and educators have long sought to understand 
the emergence of expertise, artistic and otherwise. Many 
researchers have argued that exceptional achievement can 
simply come down to                     . Studies of eminent 
scientists in the 1950s supported this view by underscoring 
the individuals’ capacity for endurance, concentration and 
commitment to effortful practice. Benjamin Bloom, an education 
psychologist, wrote in 1985 that none of his subjects achieved 
expertise without a supportive environment and a long and 
intensive period of training. This education came first from 
encouraging instructors and later from demanding master 
teachers. A few years later psychologist K. Anders Ericsson 
of Florida State University conducted studies of experts in 
piano, violin, chess, or athletics. The investigations revealed 
that a person’s level of achievement correlated strongly with 
the amount of practice put in. 
① hard work
② deep insight
③ physical strength
④ emotional stability
⑤ extraordinary talent
33. In the command­and­control management model, plans were 
considered destiny. Top management formulated exacting plans 
for every aspect of operations and then kept everything under 
tight control to “meet the plan.” All too often, however, plans 
were derailed by unanticipated events. Planning is no longer the 
exclusive domain of top management; it now typically involves 
those who carry out the plans because they are closer to the 
customer. Planning experts, who recommend strategic agility, 
say managers need to                              to take 
advantage of opportunities. A good analogy of this would be an 
improvisational comedy act. The stand­up comic has a plan for 
the introduction, structure of the act, some tried­and­true jokes, 
and closing remarks. Within this planned framework, the comic 
will play off the audience’s input and improvise as necessary.

① analyze the latest market trends
② share their plans with co­workers
③ make the workplace more enjoyable   
④ develop a detailed manual in advance

34. Let’s think about flipping a coin. If you get ten heads in 
a row, what is the likelihood that the next flip will be 
heads? Don’t be fooled ― it’s 50 percent, the same as it is 
on any single coin flip. Most people think the chances of 
getting heads will actually be lower than 50 percent ― the 
opposite of momentum. They know they should see roughly 
the same number of heads as tails (50-50), so they feel 
that if they have seen ten heads in a row, they are due for 
a tails. A tails has to emerge. But it doesn’t. There is no 
law of averages. If the process is random, there is no 
predictability. This is also what drives the “gambler’s 
fallacy.” Gamblers on losing streaks erroneously believe they 
are due for a win and keep gambling, thinking that their luck  
. But if the whole thing is random, you 
aren’t due for anything. Your chances haven’t changed at all.

① is running out
② has to even out
③ is a coincidence
④ rouses others’ jealousy
⑤ breaks the law of averages
35. If you have ever had a sip of the “bitters,” you would 
probably frown just thinking about it. According to a study 
from researchers at Brooklyn College, the horrible taste does 
more than that. Researchers had fifty­seven students rate 
their moral distaste for several morally dubious acts, such as 
politicians taking bribes, students cheating on tests, and the 
like. Before they started rating the acts, the students drank 
shots of one of three drinks: bitter tasting liquid, sweet 
beverage, or water. On a 100­point scale, with 100 being the 
worst rating for a morally reprehensible act, the students 
who drank the bitter liquid gave the acts an average rating 
of 78; those who drank the sweet beverage gave an average 
of 60; and the water group gave an average of 62. The 
ratings of the sweet beverage and water groups were 
statistically the same, but the bitter liquid group rating was 
significantly higher. This study suggests that the bad taste

① reminds the eaters of awful memories
② increases people’s moral disapproval
③ stimulates people’s thirst for drinks
④ helps people produce creative ideas
⑤ makes someone learn to be patient
36. When a certain word which is to be defined crops up in its 
own definition, we call it a circular definition. The point of 
defining a term is to explain its meaning; this obviously cannot 
be achieved if you need already to understand the meaning of 
the term in order to understand the definition.  
. For example, 
to define “stress” as “the physiological and psychological 
responses to stressful situations” would be to give a circular 
definition. This is because stressful situations are presumably 
only recognizable from the fact that they tend to produce 
stress: but the meaning of “stress” is the very thing which 
someone requesting the definition is seeking to understand, 
and so should not be presupposed in the definition. To define 
“philosophy” as “the activity carried out by philosophers” would 
be another example of a circular definition. [3점]

① Words out of circulation lose their meanings
② Words should be defined depending on context
③ Circular definitions, then, miss the point of definition
④ To explain words effectively, make use of examples

There are two main strategies we can adopt to improve 
the quality of life. The first is to try making external 
conditions match our goals. The second is to change how 
we experience external conditions to make them fit our 
goals better.      (A)     , feeling secure is an important 
component of happiness. The sense of security can be 
improved by installing strong locks on the front door, 
moving to a safer neighborhood, or exerting political 
pressure on city hall for more police protection. All these 
different responses are aimed at bringing conditions in the 
environment more in line with our goals.      (B)     , we 
can feel more secure by modifying our definition of

that risks are inevitable, and succeeds in enjoying a less

In 1985, Garold Stasser and William Titus conducted a 
study that “challenged the idea that group decisions are 
more informed than individual decisions.”

(A) When all team members possessed the same information, 
th e    g r o up decision exceeded the quality of individual choices. However, the scholars then created a scenario in 
which each member possessed unique information that his 
or her colleagues did not have. 
(B) To arrive at the optimal decision, individuals needed to 
share their privately held information. The results showed 
that “groups were more likely to endorse an inferior 
option after discussion than were their individual members 
before discussion.” The scholars surmised that the groups 
must have had difficulties surfacing all privately held 
information.

Often, however, someone has an inherent or 
acquired trait that is foreign to his or her parents 
and must therefore acquire identity from a peer 
group, which is called a horizontal identity.

Because of the transmission of identity from one 
generation to the next, most children share at least 
some traits with their parents. These are vertical 
identities. ( ① ) Attributes and values are passed down 
from parents to child across the generations not only 
through strands of DNA, but also through shared cultural 
norms. ( ② ) Language, for example, is usually vertical, 
since most people who speak Greek raise their children 
to speak Greek, too. ( ③ ) Such identities may reflect 
recessive genes, or values and preferences that a child 
does not share with his ancestors. ( ④ ) Criminal 
behavior is often horizontal; most criminals are not raised 
by gangsters and must invent their own deceptive 
character. ( ⑤ ) So are conditions such as autism and 
intellectual disability.                        * autism:  자폐증

Drawing a line is making a distinction between two 
categories which only differ in degree. Where there is a 
continuum, such as that between rich and poor, for some 
purposes, such as deciding who should be eligible for tax 
relief, it is necessary to draw a line between what is to 
count as rich and what as poor. Sometimes the fact that a 
line could have been drawn elsewhere is taken as 
evidence that we should not draw a line at all, or that the 
line that has been drawn has no force; in most contexts 
this view is wrong. For example, in Britain the speed limit 
in built­up areas is 30 miles per hour (mph); it could 
have been fixed at 25 mph or 35 mph. However, it in no 
way follows from this that we should ignore the speed 
limit, once the line between speeding and driving safely

For years, Switzerland had been trying to find a place to 
store radioactive nuclear waste. One location designated as 
a potential nuclear waste site was the small village of 
Wolfenschiessen. In 1993, some economists surveyed the 
residents of the village, asking whether they would vote to 
accept a nuclear waste repository, if the Swiss parliament 
decided to build it there. Although the facility was widely 
viewed as an undesirable addition to the neighborhood, a 
slim majority (51 percent) of residents said they would 
accept it. Apparently their sense of civic duty outweighed 
their concern about the risks. Then the economists added a 
sweetener: suppose parliament offered to compensate each 
resident with an annual monetary payment. Then would you 
favor it?
The result: support went down, not up. Adding the 
financial incentive cut the rate of acceptance in half, from 
51 to 25 percent. Even when the economists increased the 
monetary offer, the result was unchanged. Why would more 
people accept nuclear waste for free than for pay? Standard 
economic analysis suggests that offering people money to 
accept a burden would increase, not decrease their 
willingness to do so. But the economists who led the study 
point out that the price effect is sometimes invalidated by   
. For villagers, willingness to accept the 
nuclear waste site reflected public spirit ― a recognition 
that the country as a whole depended on nuclear energy 
and that the nuclear waste had to be stored somewhere. 
Against the background of this civic commitment, the 
offer of cash to residents of the village felt like a bribe, 
an effort to buy their vote.

(A)
There was a quiet forest dweller who lived high above 
an Austrian village along the eastern slope of the Alps. 
(a)He had been hired many years earlier by a town 
councilman to clear away the debris from the pools of 
water up in the mountain cracks that fed the lovely 
spring flowing through their town.  
(B)
One afternoon someone noticed a slight 
yellowish-brown tint in the spring. Within another 
week, a slimy film covered sections of the water along 
the banks, and a foul odor was soon detected. The mill 
wheels moved more slowly, some finally ground to a 
halt. Swans that had floated along the spring left, as did 
the tourists. Clammy fingers of disease and sickness 
reached deeply into the village. Quickly, the embarrassed 
council called a special meeting. Realizing their gross 
error in judgment, they rehired the old keeper of the 
spring. With (b)his faithful and silent work, the veritable 
river of life began to clear up. The wheels started to 
turn again, and new life returned to the village in the 
Alps.
(C)
Years passed. One evening the town council met for 
its annual meeting. As they reviewed the budget, the 
purse keeper’s eye caught the salary figure being paid to 
the obscure keeper of the spring. (c)He said, “Who is 
the strange ranger of the hills? Why do we keep him on 
year after year? No one ever sees him. For all we know, 
he is doing us no good. He isn’t necessary any longer.”  
By a unanimous vote, they dispensed with (d)his 
services. For several weeks, nothing changed. By early 
autumn, the trees began to shed their leaves. Small 
branches snapped off and fell into the pools, hindering 
the rushing flow of sparkling water.  
(D)
(e)He patrolled the hills regularly, removing the leaves 
and branches and wiping away the deposit that would 
otherwise have choked and contaminated the fresh flow of 
water. The village soon became a popular attraction for 
vacationers. Graceful swans floated along the crystal clear 
spring, the mill wheels of various businesses located near 
the water turned day and night, farmlands were naturally 
irrigated, and the view from restaurants was picturesque 
beyond description.
