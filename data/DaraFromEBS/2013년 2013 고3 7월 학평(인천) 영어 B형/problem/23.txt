One of the key fears we all have is fear that this is the 
wrong time to start whatever our project is, and we should 
wait until the “time is right.” Tim Ferriss, author of the 
bestselling book The 4­Hour Workweek, has this to say 
about timing: “For all the most important things, the timing 
is always wrong. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? 
The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will 
never all be green at the same time. Conditions are never 
perfect. ‘Someday’ is a disease that will take your dreams to 
the grave with you. If it’s important to you and you want to 
do it ‘eventually,’ just do it and correct course along the 
way.” If you wait for the timing to be right before you make 
a move, you may never make a move at all.
