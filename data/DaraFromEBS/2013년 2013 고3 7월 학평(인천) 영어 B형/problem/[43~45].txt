(A)
There was a quiet forest dweller who lived high above 
an Austrian village along the eastern slope of the Alps. 
(a)He had been hired many years earlier by a town 
councilman to clear away the debris from the pools of 
water up in the mountain cracks that fed the lovely 
spring flowing through their town.  
(B)
One afternoon someone noticed a slight 
yellowish-brown tint in the spring. Within another 
week, a slimy film covered sections of the water along 
the banks, and a foul odor was soon detected. The mill 
wheels moved more slowly, some finally ground to a 
halt. Swans that had floated along the spring left, as did 
the tourists. Clammy fingers of disease and sickness 
reached deeply into the village. Quickly, the embarrassed 
council called a special meeting. Realizing their gross 
error in judgment, they rehired the old keeper of the 
spring. With (b)his faithful and silent work, the veritable 
river of life began to clear up. The wheels started to 
turn again, and new life returned to the village in the 
Alps.
(C)
Years passed. One evening the town council met for 
its annual meeting. As they reviewed the budget, the 
purse keeper’s eye caught the salary figure being paid to 
the obscure keeper of the spring. (c)He said, “Who is 
the strange ranger of the hills? Why do we keep him on 
year after year? No one ever sees him. For all we know, 
he is doing us no good. He isn’t necessary any longer.”  
By a unanimous vote, they dispensed with (d)his 
services. For several weeks, nothing changed. By early 
autumn, the trees began to shed their leaves. Small 
branches snapped off and fell into the pools, hindering 
the rushing flow of sparkling water.  
(D)
(e)He patrolled the hills regularly, removing the leaves 
and branches and wiping away the deposit that would 
otherwise have choked and contaminated the fresh flow of 
water. The village soon became a popular attraction for 
vacationers. Graceful swans floated along the crystal clear 
spring, the mill wheels of various businesses located near 
the water turned day and night, farmlands were naturally 
irrigated, and the view from restaurants was picturesque 
beyond description.
