32. Scientists and educators have long sought to understand 
the emergence of expertise, artistic and otherwise. Many 
researchers have argued that exceptional achievement can 
simply come down to                     . Studies of eminent 
scientists in the 1950s supported this view by underscoring 
the individuals’ capacity for endurance, concentration and 
commitment to effortful practice. Benjamin Bloom, an education 
psychologist, wrote in 1985 that none of his subjects achieved 
expertise without a supportive environment and a long and 
intensive period of training. This education came first from 
encouraging instructors and later from demanding master 
teachers. A few years later psychologist K. Anders Ericsson 
of Florida State University conducted studies of experts in 
piano, violin, chess, or athletics. The investigations revealed 
that a person’s level of achievement correlated strongly with 
the amount of practice put in.
